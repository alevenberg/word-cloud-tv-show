Ok, I'm just going to keep moving here. Louise, you're working the counter. I put your little step stool back here. But do not alter anything on the chalkboard. Well, what if I think of something better? Which would be almost impossible not to do. You will not think of something better, Because ""new bacon-ings"" is perfect. It's hilarious. Right? You know what, I'm taking the chalk. Like I don't have chalk. Gene, you're outside, nicely offering people A free sample, all right? I'm on it! But people coming out of the crematorium next door; People obviously in mourning Yeah? Don't offer them samples. Dad, when I'm in character out there, I get in a zone! I can't keep track of who's in mourning and who isn't. Just anyone with an urn Yeah? Leave 'em alone!

He looks like a child molester. Louise, don't serve him. Let gene bring it. Uh, bob-- Why do I have to get molested? Because he's not going to molest you. Why? Because you're heavy. Bob-- yeah, hold on. Heavy kids can get molested! Yeah, who wouldn't want to molest this face? That's enough. It's not that. Bob-- I mean, gene, 'cause you're older. Tina's the oldest. Make her do it. Yeah, but tina's not good with the customers. Bob-- I'm good with the customers. No. No. Mmm, not really. I'm great with the customers. Mmm. Mm-mmm. She's autistic, she can't help it.

You can't even count. Bob! You want to know why we're here? Because I'll tell you, it's not for a routine inspection. It's not? No. We're investigating a very disturbing rumor. There's a rumor you make your burgers With human remains from the crematorium next door! Hmm. I wonder how a rumor like that gets started. It's made with human remains From the crematorium next door. [all gasping.] Who knows? Kids say crazy stuff. Here's what's gonna happen. We'll test your meat.

Gene, get off. You're choking me. Whee! You're choking me! [screaming.] So is hugo going to put dad in jail Because you dumped him?

You're on a sinking ship, lady. And you better get off before the ship sinks! Hello, the media? [all shouting.] [clapping.] Good job, everybody. An angry mob, That's just what we wanted outside our restaurant. They're over there, in their little van, Inspecting themselves. [indistinct.] Do you think I should change where I part my hair? Uh, let me see. Uh, yes? Can you open the window a little more? I'm not going to assault you. Don't touch me! Sorry. That just came over me. Listen, I came out to ask you to talk to this crowd. I mean, you made an angry mob here. Huh. Hey, what's all this stuff? You got a whole chemistry lab back there. Can't you do the test here, Instead of ruining my weekend?

[all gasping.] ha ha, I'm kidding, people! Come on. [all chuckling.] Hey, the subject of death makes us all uncomfortable, Except mort. But what about how we treat the living? 'cause sometimes we end up treating those bodies Better than we treat these bodies. We break each other's hearts. We forget important dates. We write hurtful things on poster board. We mistreat the living and no one seems to care. But once that body's dead, It's, ""hey, don't mistreat the dead body! ""hey, don't eat the dead body!"" That's the ultimate crime, right? Murder, no big deal. Cannibal? Whoa! Is he defending cannibalism? No, I'm just saying-- cannibal! See, that's a new jersey-- damn cannibal! Folks, please, I'm trying--no. Cannibals! That's not what I mean! He's gonna eat us! [distorted yelling.] Oh, thank god it didn't break. Dad, dad! Forget it. Never mind. Nada. No longer relevant. He's right, isn't he? We can test this meat right here In the mobile lab, can't we? We liquefy it, add the enzyme. If it's yella, salmonella, If it's chartreuse, it's a deuce, And if it's blue, it's your aunt sue. I know, ron! I know the rhyme! Don't you think I know the rhyme?! It doesn't matter. Don't you see, he's guilty. If it's not human flesh, it's something else. It's dirty hand towels. It's--it's something else! Stealing your woman? Nuhh! Ugh. Shut up, shut up, shut up! [sobbing.] Oh, ok, that's it, that's it. Let it out. Let it out. [bob sighs.] You're a failure. You failed. You fail at everything. You fail at marriage. You fail at family. Your kids are failures. And you're fat. You're not attractive. You never were. Well, you were a little bit, when you were a teenager. But then you got fat. What is he saying out there? He's talking to the restaurant, mom. Bobby, stop talking to the restaurant and come inside. Leave me alone! Bob, come inside. Come on. Bob, come on. Bobby. What's the use?! Dad? This is louise, your daughter. Yes, louise. What? I'm sorry that I told everyone That we make burgers from human remains. [sighs.] ok, louise. Thank you. Dad, it's gene.

[sniffs.] now my rash smells like bacon. And it doesn't itch anymore. I think we're going to be ok. Ok, tina, thank you. Louise: Dad, is the restaurant going to close? [sighs.] I don't know, louise. We're almost broke. The whole town thinks we're cannibals, And I forgot our anniversary. You'd have been better off with hugo, linda. Bob, please. No, it's true. I can't even satisfy you with my kisses. Sorry, kids. No problem. Thanks for the info. Oh, bobby! Now you listen to me. I would rather be married To a suspected cannibal with a dream like you Than a soft-lipped guy Who never had a dream in the first place. You would? No question. You're a hero to your kids and to me. Now come inside. Come inside And make us some food. We're hungry. I'm in. I'm comin' in. [kids chuckling.] Open the door. Ha ha. Open the door. Seriously, open the door! Kids, let your father in the restaurant, please. Let me in! Still serving human flesh. No. Yes! No! We have kind of an adventurous eaters club. We like to try new things. Can you seat 25 people? Oh, uhWell, we might have Some more human meat, but it's, uh, $50 a burger. That's a deal. Really--what? Really? Great. [chuckles.] let's do it. Hello. Welcome. Human flesh right this way. Uh, hi. Uh, hugo wanted to give you this. It states clearly that there was no human flesh in-- Shh! Shh. Yes, yes. Thank you. Thanks. We were able to expedite the tests, And we found 100% grade a beef-- shh, shh! Ron! I'm just sorry-- Shut up! Shut up. Ok. Hi. Welcome. Linda, I can't believe how much money we just made.

Maybe they'll leave sooner when they smell farts. Yeah. Gene can sleep with me in my room As long as he doesn't mind my night terrors. Huh? Remember, you let me watch ""night of the living dead"" when I was 8, So now I wake up every night standing in the middle of my room, Scratching the air, and kicking. Oh, good. Wait. You still get those? Yeah. They're weirder now. Oh, boy. I think my subconscious fears and my budding sexuality Are getting all mixed up. Ok, I tina, I don't want to hear it.

"Ok, kids, thank you for joining me here In the walk-in. Thank you all. You said we had to, so Shush. Brr! I should have brought my cardigan. I have an announcement about the restaurant. Here in this box is the beef That will make our-- Gene, drumroll, please. Ok, enough. Gene. [slows and stops drums solo.] Here in this box is the beef That will make our 100,000th burger. Wow. Can I touch it? I wanna touch it, too. I wanna feel it between my toes. Mmm. I wanna put a stick of dynamite in it And blow it up! No. What is wrong with all of you? No one's touching this meat but me. I have an announcement, too. My bra is chafing me. That's not a real announcement. Oh! I have one. I love House music. There! I said it! And I'm going to get my gun license, Finally. Oh, congratulations. Can't believe they're making you wait 3 days. Stop stealing my thunder! I found the banner! It's from our old printer. You just have to tear off the holes on the side. We were supposed to hit Heh. We were way off. Yeah. Big time. Ha hah! Can I just-- stop it! There it is. Get it! Dive! Oh, my god. Are you number 100,000? No. Are you mad at me? No. Oh, burger, you're cute. You're cute, too. Heh. I'm not. Whoa. Linda! I think the news is here! I wonder if they heard about our 100,000th burger! What?! Hi. How are you? Uh, what can I do for you? Are you Bob? Uh, yeah. I am. I'm Randy Watkins, The documentary filmmaker. Ok. Uh We're making a film about the beef industry. I heard you were about to hit Your 100,000th burger, And I wanted to shake your hand. Oh. Yeah. Um Because you, sir, have blood on your hands. Eww. Is this ketchup? It's the blood of 100,000 slaughtered cows. You ketchuped me. We're here to force you to face your victims. Meet your meat. What the hell? Her name is Moolissa. She's due to be ""Processed"" in 5 days, Bob, Unless you choose to spare her life. Wh-why? That's right. You will decide her fate. It's a cow ntdown. We'll see what your conscience tells you When you're looking your burger right in the eye. Ow! This is ridiculous. It's not a crime to make burgers. There's no blood on our hands! What's all the yelling about? Turns out dad's been putting murdered cows in our hamburgers. And you made us a part of it! You make me sick. Kids, please. Oh, look. A cow. Hello, Blondie. Oops. I got some meat on you. Dead cow on live cow. Gross. Heh heh. Ohh. God. Uh, not a good time, Linda. Heh heh. Ooh. Randy, stop. Stop filming. You know, We're not gonna be in your cow documentary anymore. Well, you don't really have a choice, Bob, 'cause I stop at nothing to expose injustice to animals. Is that wig glued on? Yeah. It's-- it's the only way it would stay put. It's to, uh, humanize her. It's cute. Mmm. I've seen cuter. Honestly, she's a 4. Randy, I--I don't know where to begin. You know, this isn't even a female cow. Beef happens to come from steers, which are male cows. Then, uh, how do you explain that udder? Whoa. What an udder. Get away from there, Tina. That's, uh, not an udder. Oh, it's not? Don't listen to him, Randy. You go ahead and milk that cow. Milk it good. Oh, we did. You shouldn't have. Milk doesn't come out of that. Somethin' came out of it in that bucket over there. You mean this bucket of urine? I know urine, and that's urine. Gene, put that down. No! Well, it certainly smells like urine, But that's probably because she's sick. No, she's not sick. Sick of your practices, Bob! Ok. You know, we're gonna go inside and call animal control, And then you'll have to leave. Ok, so you've got all your permits, And you're renting this storefront? Yes. Oh, yeah. And, uh, this cow has had all its shots? Yes. Sure, sure, sure, sure. All right. Well, uh, great. My job is done. I'll see you guys later. Bye. Bye. Bye, animal man. What? Oh, will you sign A release to be in the movie? Uh, yeah. A movie. Yes. You're gonna be a star! Excuse me. Hello. Thank you. The person who called you. Thank you. You can't have a cow on the sidewalk. It's dangerous. Sir, sir, the only thing dangerous about this cow Is how adorable it is. Moo. Put your hand on this cow and touch it. What? I just know that that's gonna help you. Touch the cow. Touch the cow. Touch the cow. I'm walking away. Touch it. Oh, right. Run away, tough guy! Yeah! Go take a meat bath! Or whatever it is you people do! ""Dial 'M' for mooder,"" interview one, take one.  Ma ma ma ma  d Mi mi mi mi  Perfect. Do you think cows should be ground up for food? Personally, I don't really care, But my father, he loves grinding them up. Gives him a rush. Makes him feel alive. Daddy's a bad, bad man. Is this movie gonna have a score? You know, some music to tug at the heartstrings. I--I haven't thought about it yet. Well, check this out. Think about it. Louise, what does that look like to you? Cow poop. Good eye, Tina. Good eye. No. I mean it's in the shape of a smiley face, Like an emoticon. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You think the cow is texting you an emoticon With its butt. Very interesting. Maybe this cow is trying to communicate with us The only way it knows how, with its feces. Like Gram-Gram used to do. Mom, let's say you had a brilliant plan, but to execute it, You needed to write something using cow poop? How would you do it? Oh. Is this a brainteaser? Hmm. I would use a frosting bag. Do we have one? Yeah, in the pantry. Am I right? Is it a frosting bag? We'll see, mom. Ahh. Yeah. Okey-dokey. Bye, kids. Have a good day. Murderer! Oh. Hi, Randy. Whoa. Wink with open smile. Is this for me? It has to be. What should I do? Should I text back? Comin' through. Oh, no. Ehh. Enh. Aww. That's really cute. It makes me hungry. Let's eat now. What's wrong with you people?! Yeah! What's wrong with you people?! Now let's talk about your music budget. Is it a million? We only need one megaphone out here. You know what you need? You need this! Think about it! Wow. We're mobbed. Thank you, documentary. Linda, the documentary is about me being an evil cow killer. Murderer! Oh, come on, Bob. There's no such thing as bad publicity. This could be huge for us. Like a sex tape. Like a sex tape. Uhh. It's the best free advertising we ever had. I know. It's almost sad. For who? I don't know. The cow. The cow's goin' out In a blaze of glory. Everybody wins, Bob. I guess you're right. I mean, looks kind of sweet out there-- Enjoying the day, meeting people. Hi, cow. I'm gonna eat you. Whoa. Can it hear us? Easy. Like sands through the hourglass, There goes my teeth right into your back. That's my wife. Ah, Bobby, I'm friggin' starvin'. Who could eat that beautiful creature? Shame on you! Are you going to be eating a burger today? We wouldn't dream of eating an animal. We run a petting zoo by the interstate. It's called mother goose's discount petting zoo. Petting horses, goats, and sheep. Precious memories on the cheap. It's basically an animal sanctuary That we make money off of. Exactly. Oh. Hey, Randy, thanks for the business. Oh, hey, Bob, you're welcome. Well, I'm gonna go to bed soon. What are you gonna do? Oh, I'll probably go to bed, too, 'cause I'm a person. Bye. M-Moolissa, watch out! No! Bring in the accused. Yeah, yeah. Louise, you're defending me? This so-called ""Man"" stands accused Of murdering nearly 100,000 hamburgers worth of cows. I call to the stand Moolissa. Objection! That cow's faking his injuries! And I can prove it. Think fast. Overruled. Moolissa, is the man who killed you In the courtroom today? It's me! It's me. I just make hamburgers. I never wanted to be a cow killer. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Whoa. Heavy sleeper. Wha--what happened? What's the matter? What's the matter? Go back to bed. I'm sorry. Go back to bed. Hey! Randy! Your cow's gonna freeze to death out here! Randy! Shh. Easy. Easy. Back up. Back up. Back up. Oh, my god. Heh. I know. It's a cow! You know what? You won't even know it's here. Uh, that was like that already. Definitely clean that. Oop. Step back. This is the best dream I've ever had! Everybody pee on the floor! Who's with me?! Ok, eat while it's hot. Well, well, well. Look who's too good for cereal now. He's trying to impress the cow. Don't be ridiculous. Someone knows how to treat A lady-slash- male steer. Bob, I am not comfortable with this situation. Lin, what was I supposed to do? I had that crazy dream. It was raining. Well, I had a crazy dream That there wouldn't be a cow's a-s-s In my face when I'm eating my breakfast. I know what that spells. Ass. Ass. Mom. Heh. Ass. Stop it. Say good-bye, everybody. It's going out On the street, where it belongs. Of course, ok? Of course. Right after breakfast. Cows can't go down stairs. What? What's that? Cows can't go down stairs. That's, like, a thing. I've heard that. It's like a fun fact. Bobby Hmm. Cows can't go down stairs? That better not be true. Huh. What do you know? We know you'll push on a cow's butt For half an hour without asking for help. Gotta have that butt all to yourself. Hey, Bob! What's the deal, man? What'd you do to Moolissa? It's up here! Come get it out! Linda. Uh, it's not up here, Randy. My wife's crazy. Shh. If he knows I brought the cow in, He'll think he won. So what if he won? Get the cow out of the house now. Stop. You get it out of the house. I'm trying to-- come get-- Oh. Uh, this cow. This cow, yeah, is here. Aha! Dad, I ran that bubble bath For you and Moolissa like you wanted. Bubbles! I'm not taking a bath with Moolissa, Randy. that cow to slaughter Or admit you're a hypocrite and a murderer. Wow. What a movie. Bob, what a movie. It's not my movie, teddy.

Uh-oh. Hi, Moolissa. Frowny face? All I've been is super nice to you, And this is the thanks I get? I loved you. I loved you like a horse, Which is my favorite animal. You know what? Let's just stop Before we both say something we'll regret, Like that horses are better than cows. I regret that. But it's true. Where's the cow? I believe you mean, ""Where's the steer? "" Yeah. Don't forget about that penis. Yeah. Moolissa? Moolissa? Ha! Cows can go down stairs. All you need is 4 wool socks, A mattress, and the will to make it happen. You didn't. Your girlfriend is tied up outside. Uh-oh. Nooooo Oooo What's wrong with dad? Oooo I think he hates leashes. Ooo! It's not my fault, Randy. She was stolen. I mean, it's no one's fault. Except for Linda's. I did what I had to do To protect my family and my carpet. Yeah, whatever. So who do we know That would steal a cow in a blonde wig? Maybe some perverts. Heh heh. We had a fight last night, me and Moolissa. I just wish I had a chance to make things right again. You wouldn't if you heard some of the things she was pooping about you. Hey, guys! Take a look at this! On the cheap. You fellas just leave her tied up Here at night all alone? Oh, yeah, yeah. She doesn't mind. We could just back a trailer right up here, honey, huh? We sure could, get ourselves a cow. Yeah. Get ourselves a cow. Yeah. Get ourselves a c-- What a dump. Yikes. Hey, there she is. Oh, dear god. Oh, the cow that jumped over the moon. See, that's nice. Come on. Let's go get her. We should come back after dark. Why? It's more dramatic. That is stupid. No. No, no, no. I can see it now, the big rescue. We'll shoot the whole thing in infrared. Oh, Randy, com-- in infrared? This is nuts. The kids should be in bed, Bob. It's infrared, lin. Show her. Oh. Yeah. Coo! Coo! Why are you doing that? I'm signaling. Everybody, serpentine. Yes! We're a unit. Dad, you should know If anything happens, I am in full attack mode right now. Me, too. I'm hungry for blood. And also candy. Uh, thanks, kids. Damn it. I missed the signal to stand up. Sorry, everybody. You let down the unit. I said I'm sorry. Bob, we're here. What do we do now? We, uh, uh, open the gate. That was easy. What do you think you're doing? Gene, attack! Aah! Aah! Ow! Your children are biting my legs! Randy, get Moolissa. Let's move. High-five, Bob. We did it. High-five, Randy. Nice job. I mean, we couldn't have done it without the kids biting that woman. She tasted like sawdust and goats. Beep. Uh-oh. Bob, the cow-ntdown's over. It's time to decide Moolissa's fate. Seriously? Right now? We just rescued her. She's due at the slaughterhouse, Bob. What's it gonna be? Murderer! Louise, shush. Randy, can you stop making your stupid movie for one minute And just be a human being? I don't know, Bob. Can you stop making your stupid burgers For one minute and be a human being? So now you're gonna guilt-trip me? That's what the whole movie is about. I thought we were friends now, Randy, 'cause we saved the cow together! Maybe activists- slash-documentarians Can't have friends, no matter how many cows they save! Well, that's just sad, Randy! I know! Oh, my god. That was close. I don't know what I would do if anything Happened to moo-- Ahh. I didn't hit her! I didn't hit her! I--I stopped! She's probably fine. She's dead. She must have had a cow heart attack. No. You know what? Let me get something out of my van real quick. Be right back. Moolissa! Oh, my god, no. Don't you die on me. Don't you die. Say something! Louise, look. It's a heart, A heart-shaped poop. What the hell? I didn't do that. I'm keeping it. Bob, you all right? You look a little pale. Are we dead? I'm dead, Bob. You just fainted. I fainted? Wow. That's embarrassing. Ok. I'm--I'm not a fainter. Yeah. I'm--I'm dead. Right. Yeah. But listen. There's something I want you to do for me. Make burgers out of me. What?! No. No way. Yes way, Bob. Look, ever since I met you, Making burgers makes me feel like a horrible person. Bob, I'm a castrated steer. Yeah, I'm a married man. Yeah, I'm kid-- Same thing, right? Yeah. Think about it, though. I'm a cow, you know? We're not wild stallions or humpback whales, But we wanna feel special, too. I do, anyway. You turn me into something amazing. Wait. Isn't this my subconscious Telling me what I want to hear? Hey, no. You know what? Yes, it is, actually. Well, it's working. Keep talking. Kiss me. No. I can't do that. You can, and you want to. ok. One quick one because I owe you. Uh, maybe not. Maybe I--we shouldn't. Oh, we should, absolutely. Oh, my god. What am I doing? What are you doing? I'm about to kiss a cow. Yeah. Bobby, are you ok? What's dad doing with his mouth? Looks like he's kissing. Well, this is awkward. Somebody put a blanket over it. Tastes so good. Ok. All right. Kids inside! Now! Ohh. Before Moolissa, I used to say it's just beef. I couldn't have been more wrong. Cows are living creatures With beautiful hair and soft brown eyes, Soft mouths Whoo! And also they are beef. They're the full package. Does that make me a hypocrite to say that? Yes. No, it doesn't, Randy. Or if it does, I can live with that. I present our 100,000th burger. All right! Right. Undo the banner. Bob's burger, Hooray! Do the banner. Here's the banner! Here comes the banner! I humbly call this the rest in peas burger. Heh. Because it, uh, comes with snap peas and carrots.

They take off their shoes so when they open the door, the whole block smells like feet. Feet that have been cooked in feet. - Yes! - Still funny. Ha! Oh! Ooh. Ooh. Can you smell that?

Tina, are you really sure you want to do this? Yes, dad. Wait till you see it. Jairo is amazing. I have a DVD. Oh, by the way, I need $14.95 for the DVD. Wait. What? What's jairo? Hyah! Ola. My name is jairo. Welcome to the world of Capoeira. Capoeira is the most seductive form of self-defense. It combines peacefulness, fighting, and cardio in perfect harmony. Capoeira is breathtaking, but it is also breath-giving. You can advance through the stages by earning different colored cords at the troca de cordoes. Wow, I thought maybe you were doing it wrong, but that's actually what it looks like. They're bringing the tambourine back. That's a pandeiro, a brazilian frame drum. It's a tambourine. I'm gonna get mine. Those guys don't know how to shake it. I don't get it. I mean, what am I looking at here? What is it? Is it some kind of dancing. What is it? Jairo says it's not dancing. It's a deadly form of street fighting. Oh, yeah? Well, you don't need some male model to teach you how to fight. That's what dads are for. Come on. I'll show you some stuff. Box with your old man, huh? Uh! Uh! There you go. Just got to there it is. Uh! Whoa, Tina. Good fight. Good fight. That was fun to watch. Jairo says if there's any Capoeira inside me, he'll find it with enough classes. - Jairo knows a lot about life. - Hmm. - Jairo says he can hypnotize animals. - Shh. But only if they want to be hypnotized Tina, shh shh shh shh. - Which they almost always do. - Tina! Jairo says toothpaste insults your teeth. Tina, go to bed. Jairo only needs two hours of sleep a night because he regulates his heart. Tina, get out. - Jairo sleeps with his eyes open. - Tina! Ok. Just follow my lead. Sa! Sha! Brazil! Sa! Sha! Brazil! Class is over. We now have an hour of open practice time, which is completely optional unless you're serious about Capoeira. Mm. Mm! Mm! Mm! Ho! Yah! Oh, I'm definitely staying. Ah! Ho! Hih! Sa! Tina is supposed to be here to cover the grill. It's after 4:30. She's at a kookaburra class. Dad, the grill is doing that thing again. Ach. What is your problem with fire? You know what? Go. Go away. Go down and collect trash and bring it to the dumpster. Does it have to be from around here, or can we go anywhere? Just go. Yay! Yeah! Trash!  Trash! Trash! Trash! Trash!  Yesterday I found a necklace. It's time for my afternoon meeting, you know, in the bathroom. Your 4:30 meeting? Yeah, my 4:30. - So go. - No. Tina made a commitment to be here at a certain time. I'm going down there to remind her - that she has a job here. - Wait. What about your meeting? Well, I'm postponing it today. Bob, you can't do that. I'm gonna set a time for 10:30 tonight. This is why I tell you, Bob, just have little meetings throughout the day instead of one big one, little poops. Oof! Oh! That is horrible. Wash your feet. I have an infection. Tina. Tine. Psst psst psst. Dad, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be back at work, Tina, to cover me for my 4:30 meeting. - Dad - Oh, hello. Please remove your shoes. Oh, I don't want to take off my shoes. I'm just picking up my daughter Tina. Oh, you are Tina's father. Ola. My name is jairo, like ""gyrate."" Ola. Mine is Bob. Are you sure you don't want to stick around? I enjoy helping elderly men repair their aging bodies. Thanks, but I got a job I got to get back to, and so does Tina, plus I don't really dance. Although Capoeira incorporates elements of dance, it is a highly dangerous form of martial arts. Right. I'm sure it is. It seems like a great way to stay in shape, like jazzercise. Not like jazzercise. Whatever you say. Class, would you like to see a demonstration? Come on, Tina. Let's go right now. Sha! Hyah! Sha! Hyah! Ok, ok. I saw your movie. It's very cute. Hyah! Ponytail! Hey! You can't do that. You just hit me with your hair. - Ponytail! - Stop that! Hyah! Sa! Huh! Oh! Uh-oh. Dad, let's go. Come on. Give me a second here. What about your meeting? I just had my meeting. - Right now? - Mm-hmm. Uh Don't. Don't. What do we do? - Grab me that flag. - No, dad. Tina, we're gonna get out of there, all right? Just let me think. Shh! All right. I got an idea. - You go into the corner and yell. - What? Go in the corner and start yelling like you're having a heart attack, and I'll run out. Ok. Go. Go. Fast. Wait. Come back.. - I'm having a heart what? - Don't shh! Don't do that. It's a dumb idea. Dad, I'm so embarrassed. Oh, oh, are you? I'm sorry because I'm not embarrassed at all because I just pooped my pants. I would do this every day if I could, Tina. No, no. He's in the shower now. Well, sometimes it's hard to feel clean after something like that happens. It's very embarrassing. Ok, kids. Your father is very tender right now, all right? Whatever you do, do not mention what happened today at Tina's class. Just act normal. So you pooped your pants. Linda, let's not talk about it. Wasn't a fair fight. He's younger, and he's cute and strong. Linda, this isn't helpful. Hey, when you got to go, you got to go. Linda, stop! - Are you on the phone with ginger? - No. I got to go. Ha ha ha! Sorry, Bobby. I'm not laughing at you. I was thinking about ginger's dead cat again. - Dad, dad, dad. - Yes, Louise? - Dad, dad, hi. - Yes? Hi. Did you know that it only takes two pounds of pressure to drive someone's nose bone into their brain? That's what? Two pounds. That's it, dad. Why are you telling me this, Louise? Revenge.  Revengeourine revengeourine revengeourine  - Cut it out, gene. - All right. Listen, everybody. What happened today is in the past, and we're never gonna talk about it again ever. I'm just glad Tina is quitting the class, right, Tina? But my body needs it. Your body needs to work in the restaurant with your father. OhhOh, fine. If you need me, I'll be down here on the floor dying. All right. Sounds good, honey. Ohh You have to learn to groan right, Tina. Ohh Hey, she groans fine. It sounds weird. So you groan, then, if you're so good at it. Agh. - That's a groan? - Yeah. Agh. - I'll do it. Let me do it. - Agh. Aagh Aggggh Ach Ahh Meow meow Aggggh Brr brr! Gg gg gg! Ohh - Ohh - Tina, enough already. Come on. Tina, it's your boyfriend. Oh, God. - Ola. - What do you want? I got a message that Tina was very upset and needed to be encouraged to come back to the art of Capoeira. A message? From who? You're welcome, andYou're welcome. Well, I'm sorry. Tina is busy. She's working the grill. It's ok. I'll wait. Hmm. Ah UhWell What's wrong? Well, I'm looking for your fresh-squeezed juice selection. Is it on another menu? Ahem. Oh. Sorry. Here. Yeah. Here it is. This is the same menu. Yeah, because we don't have fresh-squeezed juice. Fresh-squeezed juice is stupid. That is not how I talk at all. Yes, it is. So it Capoeira. It's stupid, ok? - Dad, stop. - Oh, hello, Tina. I didn't notice you. That's ok. Is everything all right with you, Tina? My dad won't let me train anymore. - Tina - What? It's because you made him poop in his pants. - Oh, my God. - Tina! Bob, please. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. It is quite common for a wounded animal to make a bowel movement as he is defeated by a much stronger predator. - Hey, it wasn't you. It was 4:30. - Here, Bob. Let me show you some very convenient sphincter-tightening exercises. - No, thank you. - Tight. Relax. - I don't want - Tight. Relax. - Stop it! - Tight. Don't do sphincter-tightening exercises in my restaurant. - Ok. Fine. - Thank you. I'll be feeling this in the morning. - Hoo! - Gene! Well, now my stomach is full of negative energy, so I've lost my appetite, which is just as well. It's time for me to go to class. Tina, you should come with me. Remember, the troca de cordoes is next week. The troca de cordoes? What's the troca de cordoes? I feel if Tina trains hard, she has the potential to receive a promotion to yellow cord. Tina, listen to me. You're not going anywhere. I'm your father. Yes, Tina But I am your Capoeira instructor. Wait. I'm going to class with you. Tina, what are you doing? Dad, you don't understand. I understand you're grounded, effective right no. - Bob, let her go. - No. She's grounded, Lin. We all just need a minute to calm down. Hey, Tina, you walk out that door, and you're no longer my grill cook. Dad. Calm down. I'll go get her. You get out of here! You hear me? Never look back! You are dead to us. Sorry, dad. There's no getting through to that one. Thanks, Louise. That was very helpful. - Big day. - Mm-hmm. - Big, big day. - Hmm - The troca de cordios. - I know. I know it's the troca de cordios. - I told you, I'm not going. - Ok. Fine. I'm just gonna say one more time, I think that you should come support your daughter. Linda, I just grounded her. You let her go. Bob, I'm sorry. Ok. Come on. It's just a phase. I know you're afraid your gonna lose your little girl. That's sweet, but what'd you think, she's gonna spend the rest of her life standing next to you grilling burgers? - Ha ha! Ha ha! - Ha ha! Ha ha! - Ha ha! Ha ha! - Ha ha! Ha ha! - Ha ha! Ha ha! - Ha ha! Ha ha! That's silly, spending the rest of her life standing next to me grilling burgers. Of course not. I mean, nothing wrong with it. I mean, it would be fun.  Tinarine, tinarine, cha cha cha, tinarine   Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, tinarine!  - We're ready. - Ok. - I'm coming. - I'm sorry, Tina. I'm not going. I love this restaurant. You can't abandon the things you love just because of sexy dance fighting. If I were a hamburger, you'd come watch me fight. Good job, Bob. Gene, Louise, come on. We're going to Tina's karate concert. So you're not going to get revenge today? - No, Louise. I'm not. - Ok. Got it. Then I won't bring your credit card, which I cut into a ninja star. Oh, you cut my credit card? Into a ninja star.  Tambourine, tambourine   ninja star, credit card, tambourine  Family drama at Bob's burgers, huh? - Bob. Bob. Bobby. - What, Teddy? What's a troca de cordoes? It's a ceremony. It's like a graduation. - Oh. - Yeah, but this guy is a creep, and I got to stand my ground. She made a commitment to this restaurant, period. - ""Exchange of strands."" - What? I just looked up troca de cordoes. It's portuguese for ""exchange of strands."" Sounds momentous. This very day, she's becoming a woman, exchanging her strands. Wait. That's what it says? Yeah. That's what it says. It says she's becoming a woman? Well, yeah. Take a look. What you gonna do about it, Bob? Doesn't say becoming a woman. No. Read into it. It says, ""exchange of strands."" It's exchanging strands. Has nothing about her becoming a woman. What are you saying, Bob? What are you saying, Teddy? Just, if my daughter was becoming a woman, I would want to be there. She's not becoming a woman, Teddy. No, but if she was, I'm saying. She's not my daughter. You were the one who just said it again. Get out. Get out, Teddy. I want to pay my bill! Get out of my restaurant! I want to pay my bill. There's your bill $4.16, pervert. - $4 pervert? Pervert? - Pervert. - Who you calling pervert? - It's written on the bill. Here's your $4.16, Bob. Best of luck. There's a million restaurants I can go to. Then go to them all, Teddy! - I'm sorry, Teddy. I get carried away. - No. I blew my stack. I'm sorry. It's just, she's growing up so fast. Also, I crapped my pants yesterday. Yeah. I know. I heard. Ha ha! Listen. I got to close up shop. I have somewhere to be. So you really do have to get out. - Sha! - UhAh Sha! Brazil. That's my son. Sha! Sha! Oh, God. Brazil! Sha! Sha! Sha! And I'm a Brazil. Finished. Congratulations, Neil. You have earned your yellow cord. Tina, you're next. All right! Go, Tina! You're doing great. Hyah! Sa! - Hyah! - Mm. Mm. So glad you came, Bobby. She looks like she's having a good time. - Sa! Sha! - Mm. Mm. - Hyah! Brazil! - Mm! Thank you. The test is complete. I'm sorry, Tina, but you have failed. Have a seat. The next student testing for her yellow corda is janelle. Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait. Please do not interrupt the ceremony, Bob. Just give her the stupid cord. Can't you see how much this means to her? I'm sorry, Bob, but she did not perform the 5 elementary motions, so she will not be receiving her yellow corda. What? She did better than Neil. That kid was a mess out there. What? Hey! Oh, you know it's true. Tina did all 5 of the elementary weird motions, I think. She did that one. She did that one a lot. Is this because I made you poop your pantalones? This isn't about me. It's about Tina. Oh, is that what you think? All right. That's it. I'm taking a corda. - Ow! - Don't touch. - Ponytail! - Stop that. Make me.  Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight  Nose bone! Nose bone into the brain and skin him and wear him like a costume. All right, Louise. All right. All right. Here we go. Bobby, don't do this. I have to stand up for Tina. But, Bob, look at the clock. - It's 4:28. - I know, Lin. I know, and if I poop, I poop. Oh, Bobby  Jairo, jairo, jairo, jairo, jairo  Sha! Heh heh heh. Hold on. I wasn't ready that time, so - Brazil! Ponytail! - Ow! Keep your sphincter tight, Bobby. I'm ok, Lin. - Use this, dad. - Ow! Louise - Ponytail! - Ow! - Oh! - Brazil! Uh! Huh! - Hey, you want some more? - Um - Hyah! - Ow! Make him stop, mom. - Brazil! - Uh! Dad was right. Jairo is just a jerk a sexy, sensual, creepy, sexy jerk. Go, dad! Come on.  Dad, dad   dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad  Thanks, Tina. I got him right where I want him. Ow. - Sha! - Ow! Enough. Ow! - Hey, nice form. - Thanks. Sorry jairo knocked you down front of everyone. Yeah. Sorry I couldn't get your yellow corda. It's ok. Thanks for getting beat up for me. Anyway, I'm kind of interested in russian kettleball strength training now. Don't make me watch this because I - I'll show mom. - Yeah. Well, I have a surprise for you. - You got a promotion. - Really? - I get a raise? - No But you get these yellow dish gloves. I present to you your yellow gloves. So much fun. Well, we better get going. Yeah. That dead seal down at the pier isn't gonna poke itself. Wait, wait. Hold on. You two are working today. What? We're not on the schedule today. Read. Learn how to read the schedule that you write. Tina, honey, we're giving you the day off. Go do something fun. Do you know where this dead seal is? What's that about? Its a dead seal, mom. It's a washed-up seal. They go poke at it. And we're gonna slap it. It makes a great sound. Then I sample the slaps. Sounds like an orgy. I like dead seals, but I think I'm gonna stay here instead. I'm actually having fun at work today. - Besides, it's our father-daughter time. - Aww! - Sucker! - Gene, run. Run, run, run, run, run to the seal!"
"Bachelorette party! All right! Going to the strip club. All right. Going to pickles. Boy, am I gonna need some quarters tonight. Ha ha! Quarters? Yeah. What are you gonna do with quarters, lin? I'll plop them in their g-strings. You'll plop quarters in their g-strings. Plop them right in. Flippity flop. At pickles. Pickles. Why do they call it pickles? They actually serve pickles. Hmm. No. I'm not kidding. They really have good pickles. You think they wouldn't, but they're delicious. You're going to dinner theater, aren't you? Ha ha ha! What? What do you mean? Why, that's crazy. Fine, Bob. You got me. I know you don't approve of dinner theater, so I fibbed. You know what? I'd rather you go to a strip club. What do you have against dinner theater, dad? Well, first of all, gene, it's neither dinner nor theater. It's like the imitation cheese of theater. Sounds fun. Imitation cheese is delicious. That's my boy. That's my star. Linda, you know what the real problem is? What? It's the result of dinner theater, what it does to you, makes you sing everything. Who was that?  Wrong number  Oh. Yeah. So what's for breakfast?  Eggs, eggs, eggs, bom bom   eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs  Oh, my God.  bom bomp  So, lin, it's all right.  Not tonight, no  ok.  Not tonight, no  I get it. And so you're gonna be doing that all week, right?  No  Yeah! Ha ha ha!  we drink, we loot, we rape, we shoot   we sing, we dance, we twirl, we prance   we're the pirates of panache   panache  Linda, tell me everything. Oh, mort, I'm telling you, to be in dinner theater if I could do my life over again, oh, if I could just have one chance you'd do that? Yeah. Linda, what are you talking about? You've got a great life. You work in a restaurant. You get to feed the world, right? Right. There was someone in here from Canada last week, remember, and we learned all about that country. It's great. I hate that country. You know, Linda, you've got the dinner part already. You know what that means. You're halfway to doing Yeah? Your own Say it. Yeah. Say it. What? What? Dinner theater. Your very own dinner theater. Dinner theater. Yes! Yeah! Yay! Why are we excited? Hamburger dinner theater? Oh, come on, Bobby? We work hard every day to make your dream come true. Why can't we do my dream, too? About how long do you think your dream will take, like an hour, hour and a half? You crazy? It's got to be at least a 3-week engagement. How about 3 days? All right. We'll take it. Ha ha! This is gonna be wonderful. What's the show gonna be? Ah, murder. Murder mystery. Ach. How about mass murder mystery? Ok. Sure. And a musical? Of course. Can it also be a love story? Aw, a mass murder mystery musical love story set in Nazi Germany. Oh, in Montreal. Enough with Canada! In a ketchup factory, a sexy ketchup factory? I got it! In a morgue! I have props. Oh, come on. Yes. Yes. Mort, that's it. We'll call it ""Dreamatorium. "" Really?  Dreamatorium   it's a dreamatorium  Ugh.  bom bomp  Look at this set. Am I in a morgue? Oh, it feels like I am. I am just so happy we've all been bitten by the dinner theater bug. Now, gene, you're on sound effects, naturally. Ominous. Chills. Oh. Remember, every character gets some intro and outro music. You got it. Don't. Don't score me. Mort, you're on visual effects. Fake blood Or is it? Now, script. As you know, everyone who enters my morgue is mysteriously killed. Mort body delivery guy, victim one; Gene flower delivery guy, victim two; Tina tree, victim 3; Louise the Butler who everyone thinks is the killer. You're the red herring. Tina is a tree that gets killed? She wants to be a tree, she can be a tree. Tina has got stage fright. I have stage fright? Yeah, sweetie, ever since you were a little baby. Tina, say, ""mommy."" Mommy. Uh Ma. No. Uh. I'll keep cutting. You say when. What's your emergency? Uh Tina! Help! Uh Hello? Tina! Fire! Uh That explains a lot. Now, Bobby, there's a small part I'd like you to play the tree surgeon who tries to save the tree but instead becomes victim number 4. I'd love to, but absolutely not. I'm already doing the dinner part of this dinner theater, lin, by myself, I might add. It's one line. No. What's the matter? Afraid you might get bitten? Bzz bzz bzz! Gotcha! Ha ha! Yeah. Ok. Good. Let's do a scene right now. Come on. Let's do an improv. An improv? Yeah, an improv. I hi. What's your hi. How are you? I'm just standing out here. So am I. It's cold out. Not really. Uh I have a big coat on. See? You're good. You're good. That was good. I don't like it. I don't like it. Yes. That was a whole scene. It just becomes a play. I love that. That's the play we should do. We'll call it ""big coat."" Red leather, yellow leather. Red leather, yellow leather. Um, are you taking to me? I'm warming up my instrument! Unbelievable! I'm sor uh Hey, I'm sorry. It's preshow nerves. Come here. Hug for luck. You freaking idiot! You don't hug for luck in the theater! Uh Shh shh shh. Shh shh. I'm sorry, baby. Shh shh. I didn't mean it, baby. You know how I get before a big show. You know how I get. Get off of me! You're smudging my makeup! You want me to go out there in front of these people with this makeup all smudged, you clumsy oaf! Sorry, baby. Come here. Good evening, ladies. Please enter and be tained. I don't get it, Bob. Why are people buying tickets to your burger? Linda is putting on a dinner theater, so you're paying for the entertainment plus the burger. What if someone only wants to eat a hamburger? I guess you could just pay for the burger and turn your back to the stage. I could kind of watch like this, you know, with my peripheral vision. It'd be the honor system, Teddy. I mean, if you find yourself watching the show, you should probably buy a ticket, right? Oh, that's fair. That's more than fair. Shh, but, Teddy, you can't talk during the show. No, no, no. I get it. One time I was at the movies, right, Teddy! Shh! And this guy's phone goes off during Teddy, they're starting. And this guy's phone goes off Don't tell the story, Teddy. And he picks up the phone Don't tell shh! And everyone in the theater is like, ""stop it"" Teddy, stop. Stop telling and everyone is like, ""who's the killer?"" Shut your mouth. Right. No. That's what that guy did. Shut your mouth. Everything dies  But love  Good evening. This is the story of love, but there will be a murderer, and it's up to you to guess who that murderer is. Hint it's not me Because I'm just Gladys, a lonely morgue owner. You know, they say most people find love where they work. Well, look where I work. Corpse delivery for a lonely morgue owner.  That would be me  I've been murdered to death. Aah! Aah! Aah! So no actual murder tonight, just a lot of fake blood and fake organs. Yeah. Right. Right. Fake. Yeah. We might have overdone it a little on the Gore. Well, no harm done. Except for the people being treated for shock. Yeah, and the people who demanded their money back. Eh. Well, the next performance is gonna be really great. Next performance? Wasn't tonight's debacle the end of dinner theater? I just need to tweak some stuff for tomorrow's show, maybe tone down the blood a smidge. What? I've been thinking. I want to get over this stage fright. I think I'd like to have a line. Aw, Bob, our tree is growing up and sprouting words. Let's write you a speech for tomorrow night's performance. Can I say, ""no. Don't""? That's exactly what a tree would say. I'll have it memorized by tomorrow night. Lin, you lived out your dream on stage for a couple minutes, and since there were no charges filed, they can never take that away from you, right? Bob, my dream has not been  satisfied  The show must go on, dad. Yeah. Did you give up after you made your first burger? It ain't over till it's over. No. You added garlic powder. Luck is 90% preparation and gene, enough. Oh, two more shows. This tastes nothing like real blood. Flowers for a lonely morgue owner.  That's me  Oh, God! That feels like a sharp knife in my belly. Psst, gene. Gene. Gene. Yeah? Uh-huh? Are you done? No. I need you to serve this to table 3. Bob, shh! He's dying. Stop. I'm sorry. Come on ahem. Come on, Butler. Let's go out into the garden. Tina. Tina, it's your big line. Go. No. Don't. The tree, it's been murdered. Oh, Butler, who is committing all these murders? Beats me. Oh, there's my knife. Well, I sure don't know whodunit. Do you? Is the tree the murderer, or is the flower delivery man the murderer, or perhaps the suspicious Butler. Well, you're all wrong.  The murderer was me  ha ha! What? You explicitly told us at the beginning of the show you weren't the murderer. That's right. It's a twist. No. It's a lie. A lie is not a twist. Don't be nervous. You do this all the time. The cast will be signing autographs if anyone would like one. Everyone back in their seat! Now! This is a robbery. A robbery. Now, that's a twist. This is not part of the show, people. This is a real robbery. Kids, get behind the counter. We can take this guy. I go high. You go low. Wait. What? Never mind. Never mind. Wait. You blew it. You blew it, Tina. All right. Stay where you are. Give me everything in the register. Yeah. Fine. Listen. There are kids here, so don't do anything stupidEr than rob this place. Shut up, greaseball. Don't call me greaseball Uh, mask face. It's not part of the show. Show? Gene, stop. Just take it easy. Oh, I'll take itEasy. Hmm, they added a robbery element to the show. That's clever. The ski mask is a little cheesy. I think it looks pretty good. Ok. That's all of it. You've got your money. Now be on your way. Give me a little music. Oh, come on. Just go.  Ooh da eh ooh   do your last line again   go  You've got your money. Now be on your way.  Maybe I'll leave, and maybe I'll stay   maybe it's the limelight   could be the singing   911 should be a-ringing   but I can't stop   and neither can I  Sit down. Sit down! I'm kidding. Everyone up. Come on. It's not part of the show. Play me out. Can you break a 5? I'd love to tip out the cast. No! I can't break a 5, lady! I was just robbed! Did you not just see that? You were standing right here, idiot! Oh, you people commit. Get out! We feel terrible we didn't stop that robbery last night. Oh, that robbery was horrible. Ohh! Though I have to admit, it felt so good to hear the audience applaud. Are you guys talking about that show last night? I thought it was dazzling. Oh, yeah? You saw ""dreamatorium""? Yeah. I caught the end of it. I thought the guy who played the robber really stole the show. Is that why you guys are here? No. They're here because the robber was a real robber and he stole 227 bucks. A little less than that. It'll be hard to catch this guy. Nobody got a good look at him. Put this down in your report. He was leading-man handsome. He was wearing a ski mask. Well, he had the presence of a young Burt Reynolds. And the pipes of an old Debbie Reynolds. Hey, the on-line reviews are in. Listen to this one. It's from hoosierdaddy1997. ""The plot made zero sense, and the set looked like children made it"" Yeah. Children did make it my children. ""But the reason to go see ""dreamatorium"" ""is the closing musical number. ""The chemistry between the robber character and the lonely morgue operator was sparktastic."" Did anyone mention the food? UhNo. Great. So the robbery got rave reviews. Bob, we're a hit. No, Linda. We were hit. Good one. Yeah. That's good. Hey, thanks. I don't get it. We were hit. A hit is am I wrong?  Is a robbery, right? Right. A hit is a robbery. Well, technically, for the cops technically, no. It's not Forget it. Forget it. But in layman's terms forget it, everybody. Nobody got hit. Everybody forget it. There we were, putting on the show of our lives, when in walked a man with a gun in his hand, and he was looking for you know who. We will now take questions. Oh! Me. Oh! Oh! Large Tommy. Question for Tina. Were you scared? No. She wasn't. Normal-size Jenny. How big was the gun, and did anyone get shot? That's a two-part question. I don't answer those. Aww. Tiny Peter. Does this mean you're in a gang now? That is correct. Our gang is called the broken glass kids. We'll cut you. Oh, wow. Ohh! Ach, I can wait for the show tonight. What, tonight? I thought maybe you'd consider canceling, but you're really committed to making me unhappy. The show won't be the same without the robber. What? You're all thinking it. I got to agree. That guy could really sing And rob. Well, again, our apologies. We'll follow us as soon as we hear anything. So happy for you, though. Thanks. Ahh Mort, you're right. What am I gonna do without the robber? You'll just have to  Take it easy  Wait a minute. That voice. Oh, my God, it's you. You're the robber. Guilty. Last night was something, wasn't it? Oh, I know. We were electric together. So let's do it again tonight. Yes. I want to report a what are you doing, Linda? I'm getting this guy arrested. No, but he wants to do the show again. He robbed us with a gun. Hey, everyone relax. It wasn't even a real gun fake and currently in my other jacket locked in the trunk of my car. Bob, he wants to perform. This guy is the missing ingredient to my show. He's my garlic powder. Yes. The man who robbed my restaurant is here right now. He's about 5'8"", maybe 150 pounds. I'm bad at guessing weight, though, so yeah. I'll say. Yeah. Oh, flatterer. All right. 170. Ooh! Aah! Call you back. You said the gun was in your car. I lied. What about it being fake? Also a lie. See? A lie can be a twist. Since you did that, I'm gonna do this. Register. Oh, great. Again. Good luck tonight without me. We forgot to give this to you a little ""sorry we let the robber get away"" bundt cake. You're doing it again. He just ran right past you. Hold that thought, Bob. The guy who robbed us just robbed us again. Hold on. Can you repeat that, dispatch? He's saying what I'm saying. The guy who robbed us, he just left. We got to go, Bob. The guy who robbed you was just spotted in the area. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Ah, they got him. Jeez, that Julia packs a wallop. Ah, you couldn't just let me have my dream, could you? What? You mean, because I called the police? The guy committed armed robbery, lin, twice. But you committed murder, Bob. You blew my dream's head off. That's a little dramatic, lin. Yes, Bob, because I used to be an actor. Only two tickets left for ""dreamatorium,"" the show over 3 people have been blogging about. Final performance, people. Do you think you're gonna say your line tonight? Probably not. You know, a good way to beat the stage fright imagine the audience naked. I already do that. I imagine everyone naked. Everyone? All the time? Yeah. You don't do that? No. Oh. Well, try picturing the audience with clothes on, then. Like all their clothes? Well, maybe just a condom and a hat. Ok. Tonight's show is officially sold out, packed house. Are you feeling it, mom? Whoo! Are you feeling it, dad? Whoo! Eh, who cares? The audience is expecting to be dazzled, but thanks to your father, we have no star. Let's just go do the version everyone hated. Whodunit? Was the murderer the corpse delivery guy, or was it the flower delivery guy, or was the murderer the shifty Butler? Wrong. The murderer was me. Thank you. Good night. Hold on. I saw the show last night. Trust me, it's about to get good. That's our show, everyone. Thanks for coming out. What about the you-know-who surprise performer? Yeah. Well, the show is what it is, so good night. I'll tell you what it is. It's garbage. Ok. All right, then. Drive safe. Nobody move! This is a robbery! I said, sit back down, lady, or I'll shoot! Aw, Bobby, you're in the show. Garbage. I don't want your money. I just want the money of the big shot who owns this place. Ooh, way to commit, honey. Boy, I thought we did better today. Oh, well ahem. All right. Here it goes.  So I'm singing words to a song   I'm making up right now   'cause it's the singing that matters   and not the song   so it's up to me   to   sing   in   key   Key  That was great. Yeah. Just go what? It's a little high. Well, I nailed it. You were a little high. So you go higher. I think everyone is gone. Yeah. I think we can stop. We cleared them out. No. Don't. I did it. Tina, take a bow, girl."
"Bob! Hey! Whoo! Bob! Hey, I think you missed a spot! Oh, never mind. That's just your mustache! Ka-boom! Ha-ha. Ha-ha, Jimmy! Good one. Uh, at least I could grow one. You can't! Gene? Louise? How about a ""ka-boom""? You can do better than that, dad. Yeah, step it up. Okay, you do better. Give me something. How about, I don't know Nice shoes, Jimmy. Do they make them for men, too? Ha! That's, uh that's good. Hey, Ji Oh. They're gone. God, I hate Jimmy Pesto with his crappy food and all his customers. Oh, forget about your silly rivalry for one minute. Bob, listen, come here. Tina's birthday's coming up, and I think we should do something special since she's turning 13. This is the year she becomes a woman. Yeah, I don't want to hear this. Bob, she deserves a special party this year. If what it says in her diary is true, then I'd say she needs it. A lot. It's true. Wait. You read her diary? Yeah. What I can stomach. I just skim it to make sure she's not on drugs. What what does it say? It says, ""I'm not on drugs."" It's pretty rough. But she thinks things will really turn around this year. Yeah, she dubbed it the ""year of Tina."" Why is everyone reading her diary? It's well-written. She's better on the page than in person. And what if the Nazis get us, and it's all we have of our family? Okay, fine. We'll make this birthday extra-special. All right. Tina, sweetie, come here. Yeah? Listen, baby, we'd like you to have and extra-special So take your time, and think about what would make the perfect party. I'd like it to be a boy-girl party. Mm-hmm. Mm. With mingling. I want to close the restaurant and invite my whole class over. No. And I want there to be a dj, and dancing, and a smoke machine, mmm-mm. And about two hours into the party, I want there to be a moment where I see Jimmy Jr. Across the room hmm. And we're pulled toward each other. Mmm-mm. We meet under the disco ball, mm. And we kiss until our bodies and souls become one. Oh, God. And it's my first kiss. Mm. And it's perfect, and I remember it forever. Freak. Scary. Wow. You've really put some thought into it. That, uh, sounds expensive. And I could do without the kissing Pesto's kid part. Oh. It's okay, I guess I wasn't meant to have a good life. Bob, a word? Now? Not now. Now. All right. You want to kiss Jimmy Pesto Jr.? Yes. A lot. Many times. I can help you. I'll be your kissing coordinator. It's my birthday present to you. Yeah, I think I know how to kiss. Ow! Do ya? You think you know how to kiss? You know how to lock lips, huh? Do ya? Ow! You think you know what it feels like to kiss a man, Tina?! If you don't know what you're doing out there, you could get yourself killed. Or worse! Ow, ow! STDS, Tina, have you heard of them? Have you heard of herpes? Have you? Yes. Yes. Do you know what herpes feels like on your mouth? Yes. What? What is it? What? Like, um, cuts on your mouth. That sounds right. Sla I'm gonna slap gene. Ow! Closing down the restaurant, getting a smoke machine, and a dj? That's gonna add up. We have nothing extra this month, lin. Well, we got to do what we got to do. Look at her. She's so awkward. She's a good girl. Okay. I'll talk to Fischoeder about getting an extension on the rent. It's foggy. Yes, it is. Are you there? I am. Why are we here in the fog? I-I wanted to meet you, and then you told me to meet you here. Oh, that's right. It was a good idea. I love the fog. Listen, Mr. Fischoeder, I know we talked about never doing this again, but if you can just give us two extra weeks this month on the rent I'm going to have to stop you right there, Bob. Were-were you going to follow that up with anything? No. Oh. Oh, I love the way the fog feels under my cape. Uh, right. I'll get going. Bob, listen. What do you think of this? What if I don't give you an extension on your rent, but I do give you the opportunity to earn some extra money in one of my side businesses? That sounds Sketchy. Oh, it is, Bob. Oh. But you get to wear this hat. So, for the next week, I'll be driving a taxicab to pay for Tina's party. And I'll be wearing this hat. Cool! Cool! Cool hat or job? Job. Hat. Thank you, dad. This party is gonna sizzle. Stop it. Wait, wait. Bob, Bobby. Yes? When are you going to have time to drive a cab? Well, I'll work the full day at the restaurant, lin, then I'll go drive the cab from 10:00 P.M. To 6:00 A.M. Aww, Bob. All right, all right. Wait. Why do you have to wear a hat? Just let this be fun for me. Dad, you won't regret this. When I kiss Jimmy Jr. Under the disco ball, it'll be like we're all kissing Jimmy Jr. Under the disco ball. I call first. Really? Well, if I'm gonna kiss him, I don't want to go after you guys. I'll go last. I'm fine with that. We're not kissing Jimmy Jr. Yes, we are! That's ten pieces of gum, Tina. Chew! Chew! A kiss is like a fight with mouths. And time. Spit. I'm going to destroy this kiss. Ow! Not yet. There's my Johnny two-jobs. Making money for the dream birthday party. Okay. Off into the night I go. Bobby, be safe out there. And make chitchat. You'll get more tips. Yeah, and keep the meter running. Watch out for pukers. And stay away from route one. It's bumper-to-bumper all the way to the interstate. Tina, how did you know that? I like traffic updates. Why? I like when they say ""bumper-to-bumper."" ""Bumper-to-bumper""? Yeah. Uh, bye. Stupid beaded seat cover. Ooh, okay. I get it. Fm. Nice. Hey, guess what? You're my first fare. Oh, no! No. Oh. Uh, where to, ladies? Fourth and ocean, doll. Thanks for stopping. Most cabbies are too prudish to pick us up. And, uh, that's because you are? Fabulous! That's true. Well You're clearly fabulous. Yeah. Yes. Hey, eyes on the road, mister. Yeah, stop staring at us. This ain't no library. Don't fall in love, Mr. cabdriver. You can't afford us. Hey, who's picking up who here? Hey. Don't worry, ladies. I'm-I'm kidding. I'm, uh, I'm a married man. So am I. Now, Tina, anyone can tie a cherry stem with their tongue. Let's see what you can do with this banana peel. Get-get it in there. Bobby! Good morning. You're home. Yeah. Guess who learned a lot about transvestites last night. I was only on that web site for, like, two seconds. What? No. I was talking about me. I picked up a group of transvestite hookers who showed me a side of this town I never knew existed. And, gene, you're banned from the computer for two days. After what I saw, I'm-I'm fine with that. What's a transvestite hooker? Bob, I'm not sure this is appropriate breakfast conversation. I guess you're right. Maybe I should just try and go to sleep. Gene, honey, I think he's sleeping. I have to go to school. Shh, shh. Just hold still. Ew. Is this drool or sweat? It's both. Your father is a very moist sleeper. Aw, look at my two boys. Nice. Oh, a bow. Let's put that on dad's head. There's your transvestite. Get the camera. I'm having a birthday party this Saturday. It's co-ed. Because I'm becoming a woman. Co-ed? My hands just got clammy. Hey, Jimmy Jr. Hi, Tina. This is an invitation to my birthday party. Hey, I notice you haven't RSVP'd to my party yet. Um, I need to ask my dad for permission. Can I let you know later? Sure, okay. Butt.  Across 110th street   pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak   across 110th street   pushers won't let the junkie go free   across 110th street  Oh, how you holding up, Bob? Good. I mean, I'm tired. And, um, I might be a pimp. You're gonna need a bigger hat. Well, you're still father of the year. Hmm. Tina's party's gonna be amazing. I got a disco ball and streamers. It's gonna be like Buckingham Palace. Yeah, yeah. Studio 54. Those are two very different examples. Well, you get the idea. You know. It's a party. So, is Tina happy? Uh, she'll be happier once Jimmy Jr. RSVPs. She's over at Pesto's right now to see if he'll come. I told her to show some skin. So, how'd it go? Jimmy Jr. isn't coming to my birthday party even though he wants to because his dad won't let him. All because our dads hate each other. Oh. Sorry, Tina. I'll never know how soft Jimmy Jr.'s lips are. My guess is, they're pretty soft. Like, a Like a Kitty cat's tummy. Gene, stop. Without Jimmy Jr., I don't want to have a party. Hey. Your father's been working very hard for this party, young lady. It's going to happen. Right, Bob? I'll refrost it. It's still good. Mmm. Oh, it's delicious. Tina, honey, your father's been working his you-know-what off, driving a cab to pay for this. Yeah, and we've rented the smoke machine, so this party is definitely happening. You've been working your you-know-what off? I've been working my ass off! Night and day training! Louise, take it easy. Do you know what she was like when I started working with her? She was a sick joke! Now look at her! Incoming. Bob, you gotta go talk some sense into Jimmy Pesto. This isn't fair. Fine. Uh, hey, Bob. You look like crap. Nice. Yeah, that was funny. Look, Jimmy, my daughter Tina said that Jimmy Jr. isn't allowed to go to her birthday party. Whatever issues we have shouldn't matter. Just please let Jimmy Jr. go. Okay. Okay. You know it's going to cost you, right? Oh, God. Yeah, you see, Bob, I'm a collector of rare and exotic trophies. Well, that's pathetic. And you have something I want to add to my collection. Your mustache. Your bushy, robust, filthy eyesore of a moustache. What are you talking about? I want you to shave your mustache, and bring it over in a baggie, and I'll pin it on the wall. What? Why? As a trophy. Trophies. Well, I'm not giving you my mustache. Well, I'm not giving you Jimmy Jr. then. This is crazy, just let him go to my daughter's party. If you want a bag of hair so bad, why don't you just pick it out of the food you serve here? Ka-boom! How dare you. No 'stache, no bash. So, what'd he say, honey? Are these lips gonna see any playing time? Yeah, is Jimmy Jr. Coming to my party? No, Tina. I'm sorry, he's not. What happened? You two couldn't work it out? No! We couldn't work it out, Linda. He said the only way he'll let Jimmy Jr. go is if I shave my mustache and give it to him. So Jimmy Jr. can come to my party? What? No, Tina. But if all you have to do is shave your mustache then he can come. Yeah, it sounds to me like you just said that Jimmy Jr. can come. That's what I heard. Done deal. I'm not shaving my mustache. It's my mustache! Hey, no, watch it. You know, Bobby, you're just as handsome without the mustache. Kind of. Uh, so that's what we should show our kids, lin-- that it's okay to negotiate with terrorists? I'd drive a cab every night for the rest of my life for my kids, but I'm not letting Jimmy Pesto humiliate me. You're the most selfish father in the world. Oh, Bob. Good night! You can't shave it, Bob. It's glorious. Oh, I miss having a mustache. Pff. Miss it? Honey, news flash I can see it from here. You can see it from space. Stop it, cha-cha. I will thumb your eyeballs out of your skull. Ay! Hey, come on. Glitter, your I happen to like the way your upper lip looks. Thank you, prince Valiant. Your shift's almost over, right, papi? Yea uh, yeah it is. Why don't you join us for a beer? Yeah. Yeah. We'll throw back a few beers and smoke some crack. Crack? Just the beer, then? What is that? Ooh, your breath! I know. Bobby, listen. Hmm? All right, I talked to Tina, I told her how hard you've been working, and she agreed to come to the party tonight. For a few minutes. It's something. What party? Bob, you're delirious. Shh. You are. You're drunk. I may or may not have tried crack. Okay. Last night. I don't think I did. But if I did, I liked it. Okay, Bobby, listen, go take a nap, and I'll watch the restaurant, please. Take off your clothes. Bobby! I got to go to bed. Bobby? I don't want to do this. Stop it. Get your hands off me, sick idiot. Such a freak. Pull it together. I'm like an animal! Keep your voice down. I'm like king Kong! Unbelievable. I need to go to bed. Good night. Go get me special pillow. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hey, sleepy bear. What time is it? How much longer till the party? It started a half hour ago. What? Ow! Oh. You let me sleep all day? Why didn't you wake me up? I tried. That was not the first pickle I dropped on your face. The boys hate dancing, and the girls won't ask the boys. It's a Mexican stalemate out there. Come on, boys. You're the peanut butter. Girls, you're the jelly. Let's make some sandwiches! Oh, God, why is mort doing magic? It's his gift to Tina. Uh-oh. I mean, ta-da! Tina, you look great. Maybe I can cheer her up. Louise, smoke me. Tina, dance with mommy. Uh, uh, uh, uh. It's a party. All right! Did someone say party? They don't go to my school. I'm sorry, ladies. We're closed for a private party. We were invited by Bob. Bob? You invited transvestite prostitutes to our daughter's birthday party? No. Maybe. I This week has been kind of a blur. All of you are coming to my daughter's party. We're gonna have so much fun. And bring whoever you want. I might have thrown it out there. Is this the sweet 13 party? Dad, you brought all your nighttime friends, but you won't shave your mustache to get me Jimmy Jr.? Where do I put my coat? Oh, hey, marshmallow. So, marshmallow, how'd you get your name? 'Cause if you show me a sweet potato pie, I am on top of it. I knew it! Tina, I know you're upset because Jimmy Jr.'s not here, and that there are more transvestites than you imagined, but Unless you're Jimmy Jr., and you're here to kiss my lips, I don't want to talk to you. Come on, girl. It's your party! You might as well enjoy it. It's like I always say. When life gives you lemons Tuck em'! Uh, I think what my girlfriend here is trying to say is, when it's time for you to blossom into a woman, you can't let anything stop you. Not a party, not a boy, and not a town full of doctors who refuse to remove your penis. And you have a very good father, baby. Never forget that. It's true. Not many fathers would make the sacrifices your father made to throw you this party. Working two jobs. The things he saw. The things he smelled. He deserves an award. Bob, what'd you do? You lost your nose cozy. Oh, Bob. You made yourself ugly to save Tina's party. Yes, Linda, this is why I didn't want to do it. But you know, it's worth it if it means Tina will be a happy teenager. Just stop staring. Stop! Don't do this. I just did it. You don't need to. I don't want you to. You know how mustaches work, right? Well, don't give it to Jimmy Pesto. What about Jimmy Jr.? Jimmy Jr. isn't gonna make this party perfect. You already have. Really? I'm sorry I didn't appreciate everything you've done for me. I didn't appreciate it as a girl, but I do appreciate it as a woman. It would have been nice to hear you say that a minute ago. Bastard. Come and join the party, Bob. That's Jimmy Pesto, cha-cha. The guy I was telling you about. Wait. That's Jimmy Pesto?! I know that guy. We all know that guy. But we know him as baby num num. Baby num num? Wait. Pesto is one of your dates? He wishes. We run in the same circles. He's a regular over at the desire dungeon. He's what's known as a diaper-lover. You know what that is? It's nasty. Jimmy Pesto is a diaper-lover? Ha, ha, ha. Hello, Bob. Well, I see I'm getting my trophy after all. Bup, bup, bup, bup. Not so fast, baby num num. Baby How do you know about that? Hey, baby. Oh. Hi! No. We just wanted to see if ""wittle"" baby num num Shh. Come on. Quiet. Wanted to change his mind about letting Jimmy Jr. Go to Tina's party. Or maybe he wants the whole ""westaurant"" to know about Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on. Hey! We got Fresh pie!  How he likes to put on Listen, would you? Diapers and poop in them. I don't believe it. Thanks, dad. You're the best pimp I'm ever gonna have. I've been waiting to hear those words all my life, Tina. Happy Birthday. Bobby, come help me with the candles. This one goes out to the birthday girl. Pardon me. Birthday woman.  If you were here  I like your shirt. Are those snaps? Yes. Snap. One more. Snap. Want to dance? Yes. It's go time, Tina. I want his kids to have hickeys.  But would you suspect   my emotion wandering, yeah?  I just kissed my first boy. Me, too. Oh, boo hoo. Mmm! Mmm. Hurry up and grow that thing back. I know. It's bad. Now! Concentrate! Push it out. I'm trying, lin. Oh, let me cover it with my finger. That's okay. I'm gonna glue this to my chest so I can wear v-necks. Glue it to your back! Oh, glue it to your palm."
"I'm back. - What's all this? - Ugh. We're renting the rooms in our apartment for the long weekend. We're gonna be a Bed & Breakfast. So exciting. I love Bed & Breakfast. - They're so quaint. - Aren't they? Random strangers shedding skin cells all over the house. Ugh, I'm against this Bed & Breakfast as much as you can be against something, and still, let it happen. Like when my ex-wife wanted to have - a three-way with out neighbour, ray. - Teddy, Teddy. I don't think you should be talking about Wait, you had a three-way with ray, the guy who wears the sales suit - down on the pier? - Yeah. I mean I wasn't *** Yeah. I had a three-way in science class yesterday. Tammy's lab partner was absent so she joined in with me and Joey. - It was fun. - Okay, enough. Oilies, salties, extra-expensive toilet paper I love that soft stuff. I thought we were doing this to make extra-money. Isn't all this eating into our profits? Don't worry, Bob. It's gonna be money and online reviews and when I die and I go to heaven. God's gonna say ""Hey, aren't you the lady who rented the b&b I heard about? And I'm gonna say, ""Yes, God"" - ""What can I get you?"" - Here, hold this. Mm, smell. Come on, smell it. You're shoving things in my nose. Smell this one now. You always do this, Lin. Whenever you entertain, you put way too much effort into it and drive yourself crazy. What are you talking about? - I'm a wonderful hostess. - No, Linda. You go overboard and then if people aren't appreciative enough, you snap. That's not true. I'm a gifted hostess and I'm ready to go pro. - It is really soft. - Put it back on the roll, please. But, mom, what if we just put Tina by the toilet? - Yeah. - I don't mind. Almost check-in time. Tina, Gene, are your rooms guest-ready? - Yeah. - Subjective. Remember when you made fun of me for moving into a closet? Well now you suckers have to give up your room and I don't. A guest! Javiis an entomologist. - Javed. My name is Javed. - What? Alright. What kind of doctor is and entomologist again? Glands, butt? Ha, I'm not a butt doctor. I study insects, specifically the mating habit of the myfungal beetle. Oh. So what brings you here? Myfungal beetles feed on fungus, and this town has a very, very high potency of fungus. Uh, that's actually our town motto. Fungus town! Tina, why don't you show Javeeed His room Javed. Jav-ed? Javed. You'll be in the equestrian suite! Huh? Okay. That's great he brought a bug in a jar into our house. Don't be racist! I decorated it myself. You Like horses a lot. You like jars. Oh, these are specimen jars I intend to mate the queen with a male and preserve her eggs. You mean you're gonna watch beetles have sex with each other? Mm-hmm. Cool. What's that for? Ooh, this is a synthetic pheromone. It's similar to what the queen emits when she wants to attract males. Does it work on human boys? Oh, no. Well, maybe. Ah May I store these in the bathroom? Sure. Everyone would love that. More guests! Welcome! You must be Ed and Nora Samuels! Yes. Hello. Hi. Come on, come in. I'll give you the tour. Okay, this is the salon. This is where we're gonna have the meet-and-greet, and you're just in time! Uh Actually, we'd just like to go to our room, if that's okay? Right. We'd just like to get settled. What? Why? Stay here for the meet-and-greet. Maybe we'll come back out in a bit. No, stay. It's gonna be fun. Tina, get Javeed! I think he's napping. Wake him up! So, let's go around and we'll, um, we'll play a little game. Let's say what our most embarrassing moment was. Who wants to go? I'll go. One time I coughed at communion, and the wafer flew right out of my mouth and it landed on my boob! Who wants to go next? Javed? I'll take a pass. Get me on the next one. What about when dad got a perm? It wasn't a perm; It was a body wave. You looked like Barbra Streisand in the main event. You looked like Barbra Streisand's pubes. I did. How about how dad says gracias in Mexican restaurants? That's embarrassing. Remember the time you asked me to check your prostate and you made a poopie? Linda! Oh, remember when dad tried to go jogging? Oh, come on! What about when dad cried at the end of about Schmidt? Gene, why are you in your underwear? I was eating. What, you want me to get butter all over my clothes? Yeah. Now we just take him out back and hose him off. You're a doctor is this a mole? I'm not a doctor. And that's a raisin. Oh edible mole. All right, let's let someone else go. Samuels, how about you, what's your most embarrassing moment? I don't know. This? Yeah, definitely this. Hm. Are we done? Yes, I guess we are done, Nora. Are you sure there aren't any rooms available anywhere else? No, everything's booked I checked. Ooh, hello. Hm. I'm cold. My nipples are so pointy! Ding-dong! It's for you. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-hmm Mm-mm. It might be a package You should answer it. Yecch! Lin, stop stewing and go to sleep. I can't help it, Bob! Our guests are such party poopers. All of 'em! No one has any b&b spirit at all! Okay, just go to sleep, all right? You'll feel better in the morning. Fine! Gene, gene, your foot is down the back of my underwear. It's warm down there My feet are cold. Yes, but it's my ass. Mm. Dad, are you still awake? Yes, Tina. I was just talking to Gene, right? A second ago? Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? Oh, my God. I don't know. Tina, go to sleep. Dad, do you want any chicken? Don't tell anyone There's just enough for the two of us. Just go to sleep, all of you. I'm glad our guests are comfortable, Linda, 'cause this is great! Oh! Our guests! They'll appreciate me. I'll just have to try harder next time. Hey! I've got a backup. I've never been so happy to be at work. Yeah, you opened early today, huh, Bob? Well, there was a line to get into the bathroom up in the apartment, so I came down here to do my morning routine in the slop sink. Whoo! Whoo! Bob, do we have any toothpicks down here? Yeah, over there. Pretty ones? What do you mean, pretty ones, Lin? The nice ones. How's the b&b going, Linda? Oh, it's great! Why? What'd you hear? What? Nothing. I bet it's magical up there. I picture it like england. It is, Teddy, it is. But do they appreciate it? Holed up in their rooms like dirty little gophers? Why come to a b&b if you're not gonna participate, you know? Oh, they're so ungrateful! I wish I was staying at your b&b. I'd sit in the parlor, and maybe I'd have a little wine, play some board games Yes! Wine! Games! Teddy, you should stay here. What? You should. You're the dream guest. Really? You're the one I'm looking for? Do you have any vacancies? Yes! Louise's room! Whoa, whoa, whoa, Linda, Louise's room? She'd murder us. She's a big girl She'll get over it. Linda, she won't get over it When you vacuumed in there, she wouldn't talk to you for a week. Plus, it's not even a room; It's, like, a closet. That sounds perfect for me I don't need a lot of room. I'll just bring, like, one outfit. Oh, I love it! I'll get my stuff. This is gonna be great!

"Wow, I thought last year's art crawl was terrible, but they really outdid themselves this year, huh? Yeah. Ugh, bad. Very bad. Mm-hmm. Oh, look at that. Really bad. Really, really bad. Ugh! Ugh! I think they're good. Dad, why does art crawl suck so much? Well, it's just a very loose definition of art, Louise. And don't say suck. Don't say suck, please. You're right, though. It does suck. I don't want you kids to think this is what art is. We should go to a museum. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Yeah, maybe not. Yeah, we should We should not go to a museum. Let's not overdo it. Let's just walk around and make fun of this stuff. Yeah. Okay. Why don't we just go back to the restaurant? Because your aunt Gayle is there hanging up her art, which we're not allowed to make fun of at all. Well, why can't we make fun of aunt Gayle's paintings? She's family. Yeah. That means never holding back anything, right, pit stains? Am I showing? Let's just say your shirt looks like my underwear right now. Yeah. Well, look, no one tells Gayle anything she can't handle. That's your mom's rule, all right? You treat her like a mental patient. Well, I mean, she probably should be one, right? Yeah, I heard she ate her lipstick once because she wanted to feel red inside. And she made a dress out of live shrimp and wore it to mass. Oh, and she shaved her cat. Come on, Louise. You know none of that is true. Except for the cat shaving. And maybe the shrimp and the lipstick. Are you kidding me? My kid could paint that. Wow. It costs $200. Someone bought that mess?! How rude! Harold! Harold?! What? There are some poorly supervised children amongst the art. Get rid of them! All right. Let's go. Keep moving. Excuse me. Are you a? Are you a bouncer? Are you gonna bounce my kids? No, no. Just keep it moving, chubs. Chubs? You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. Hey, easy, pal, all right? Don't touch. Come on, dad. This guy's not worth it. Ah, listen to your kids, fatsy. Fatsy? Come on. Come on, dad. Louise Dad, look me Give me your eyes, dad. Give me your eyes. Mm-hmm. Take a deep breath. You are lucky, pal. It's not worth it, dad. If you hit him, your hand would smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You Well, that was awkward. What is that place? You don't know reflections? They sell art, not just during art crawl, but year-round. Reflections. It sounds like a strip club, the way you say it. Reflections. Mmm. So, brace yourselves for aunt Gayle's art show. Mom said aunt Gayle told her they're just adorable animals. Oh, yeah? Well, that doesn't sound so bad. Hi, hon! How was art crawl? Hey. Huh? Everything's going great here. We're having fun. Oh, wow. Lin Gayle's here! We hung-hung her paintings! Look at this one! Look at that one! Linda, can you just let me see? Oh, my God! Yeah! Anuses! Oh, God. Oh, my God, lin. It's a few days, Bobby. Linda, there are animal anuses all over our walls. Just think of 'em as cute little rumps. Lin, they're anuses. I'm trying to think of worse paintings to hang in a restaurant. Um nope, I can't think of any. Bad monkey! Kids, stop that. No. I'm spanking the monkey! No way, dad. This is the best thing that has ever happened to us. Horse butt. Oh, hello, sir. Don't look at the pictures of the anus Yup, he already did. Okay. You see that, lin? No one wants to eat with one of those staring at them. Come on, you can't seriously think that this is a good idea. Well, they're not for me, but we promised Gayle she could display her art for the art crawl. We can't take it back now. She's fragile. We have to support her. She's not that fragile, lin. What happened? What happened? Gayle, Gayle honey, look, look, it's a fork. What? Look, it's a fork. Oh, it's a fork. Ha. Oh, you're killing me. She's killing me. Okay, so she's fragile. And that means we have to be the anus restaurant? Yes, it means that. Oh, we can make t-shirts! It'll say: ""Milk, milk, lemonade. Around the corner art is made."" Bob! Do you love 'em? Or do you just love 'em? Um, how did you? Why why would you paint this? The inspiration came to me on a mountaintop. What should I paint? Huh. He loves 'em! All right, listen up. All the suckers come out for art crawl. And they all want to pay money for crap. So paint some crap, and we can sell it. Wait. You're not painting? No, I'm management. You two paint the stuff, I'll do the rest. I'll be wheeling and dealing. I'll be getting my percent. Okay, let's see what you got so far. Time's up. Paint brushes down. What the hell is this? I told you to paint commercial touristy crap. I'm sorry I'm not a sellout. I can only paint what I feel. And I can only paint the truth! The robots are coming! Hide! Ah, this is great. You guys want to be real artists, huh? Okay, that's an angle. I can sell that. But if you're going artsy, then you're going all the way. Someone's cutting off an ear. I need both of mine. I wear glasses. Welp, what's your excuse? Don't got one. Have at it. Teddy, what's wrong? You haven't touched your food. I don't, Bob. It's just the, uh The anuses? Yeah. Yeah, you know. Yeah, they're, uh I know. Oh, they're like Mona Lisa's eyes. They follow you wherever you go. Ooh, you're right. Well, I like 'em! You like 'em? Ugh. Yeah. What's the problem? The anus is the window of the butt. It's true. I guess she's just painting what we're all thinking. Well, okay, but, mort, would you hang them up in your funeral home? 'Course not. That would be terrible for business. I'm not an idiot. Count to three, but do it on ""two."" I'll keep it on ice until art crawl's over. Thanks, t. Here goes. Now listen, gene. I'm gonna have trouble cutting through the cartilage at first. While I'm doing it, just think about your art. Okay! All right. Ready? Ninja robot. Ninja robot. Ninja robot. One two Hey, kids. Oh, hey, dad. I had to get away from those anuses for a while. You mean mort and Teddy? No. No. Your Gayle's paintings. What are you kids doing? What knife?! What do you mean, what knife? Why are you holding a knife? Why am I holding a knife? She's turning me into a real artist. No, she's not. Put the knife down, Louise. I want to be an artist! Like Leonardo Dicaprio. That's right. That's Da Vinci, gene. No! The only way I can sell this garbage is if I make them legit! Hey, wait a second. I have an idea. You know who loves the stuff you kids draw? You? No. Your mother. This crap is like catnip to her. She can't resist it. Bring 'em inside. All right, we need to get these up before they get back. Your mom will be so excited to see this stuff, she won't even notice that I took Gayle's paintings down. Pretty manipulative, dad. I see where I get it. Thank you. You should see my taxes. Uh, what's this supposed to be? A ninja robot fighting a vampire tape recorder at stonehenge. Who's that in the background? That's my friend Ken. Why is he like that? He's an albino. Oh. Yeah. I've never met Ken. Is he real or imaginary? He's real, and he does improvised hip-hop. Okay, how old is he? He's 28. You can't have a 28-year-old, albino friend. Yes, I can! All right, I can't deal with this right now. Tina, what do you got? It's our dentist. Dr. Yap? Why is he nude? Wait, has he been nude with you, Tina?! I exercised some artistic license. Uh, I We're switching dentists. No! I can't deal with that right now. But Let's get 'em up. Linda, Gayle. How was lunch? Very interesting. I think  the waiter might have been hitting on me.  Yes. He was very attentive. And he asked you a lot of questions about food. What was that all about? Uh, Bob? Where are my paintings? What? Wha? Oh, I had to take a few down to make room for the kids' stuff. Bobby! Aw. The kids' stuff! Yeah. It's like our wall is a giant refrigerator. I love it. Huh. Gee, Bob, if I didn't know any better, I'd think You didn't like my paintings. What, no? I Aw. No, no, no. I know when I'm being lied to, Bob. It's like when I look at myself in the mirror and say, ""it's going to be okay."" Fine, look, Gayle, I'm gonna level with you. No. No, Bob. No. No leveling. No. Here we go. Gayle, the thing about your paintings Bobby! Ah Oh, look, senior visitors! Yay! Oh. Well, look who it is. Great. The art store people. Oh! Reflections. I love that store! I love your yarn. What can we get for you? I'm not here as a patron. I'm here as Edith Cranwinkle, chairperson of the art crawl. I rushed right over here because there are murmurs, whispers and murmurs around town, that you're displaying Certain offensive orifices during the art crawl. Offices? Orifices! Not anymore. I took them all down. Oh, what a relief. I'm glad you agree with my decision. Your decision? What decision? That you can't display that type of art here. Wait. I can't? Absolutely not! It's obscene. Obscene. Oh, really? Yes. I won't allow it. Excuse me? You won't allow it? That's right, Tubsy. You heard her. Who are you two to tell me what I can or can't hang on my wall? I am chairperson of the art crawl. Well, I'm the chairperson of this restaurant. And you know what? They're gonna go back up. How dare you! Aw, Bobby! Gene, Louise, go get the paintings. Here they are! Step into the butt closet! I will not! You should try it. I will not! What's it going to take to get you into this rhino anus today? You are in direct violation of my wife, Bob.

Or don't. Either way. It's your choice. Hey, you asked for this, lin. I'm just doing what you wanted me to do, support your sister. Oh, what a crock of crap! This is about you and your pride and that Edith. And you just want to provoke her. Damn right, I do. This one big enough for you, Edith?! Fresh from their triumphant debut at Bob's burgers!

Yes, yes! All of 'em do. Every all the good ones. Oh, God, what a whirlwind we've been on. I feel like let's just put this all behind us and move on. I'm going down there. What? Where? To see Edith.

Can it, Edith. I'm here to get an apology. For what, standing up for artistic integrity and common decency? There's nothing decent about what you did. First you tried to tell me what to put on my walls, then you vandalized it. Have you no shame? I have no idea what you're talking about. And neither does he. What? Hit her, dad! I'm not gonna hit her, Louise. Hit her, dad! Gene? Tina? What are you two doing here? Learning to paint. We're honing our craft. Okay, well, good luck trying to Polish a turd. Wait, I thought you hated my kids. My artwork shop is open to all who respect art. So I'll have to ask you to leave. Then ask me. Please leave. Not before I get an apology. Not on your life! Have it your way, art lady! Hey. Poke her in the eye with the brush. Oh, I've got a better idea, Louise. Ha-ha-ha! Take that! Dad, what is that? It's an anus. Oh What else would it be? What has this been all about? You call that an anus? It looks just like a black dot! What kind of anus is that? Oh! Well, then, Harold, it looks like I'll need to practice a little more. I'll say. How about one right here! And what about here! Ow! This one might need an anus! Aah! How about this lighthouse! It has an anus now! Looking good, dad. Thanks, teen. Rip that lighthouse a new one, dad! I feel so alive! This is what God must feel like. Kids, tell your mother not to wait up! Use the brown! Use the brown! You should've seen it, mom. Dad went nuts! Aw, Bobby, what'd you do? I got justice, lin. Dad painted an anus on a lighthouse. Yeah. And on a Mountain and on a sunset and on a sailboat And on Dr. yap. And Ken. Yeah, I'm sorry I painted on your paintings, kids. They were in the line of fire. You painted anuses on paintings? Where's Gayle? I got to tell her how I stood up for her. She's in the basement trying to get the underwear off her paintings. You shouldn't have done it, Bob. Are you kidding, lin? It's the best thing I've ever done in my life. Ow. See, that's how you put on handcuffs. They don't look tight enough to me. Why are these on me? Because you anally defaced her property. But she started it look what she did. Oh. I like the new direction and wish I could take credit. But like I said, I had nothing to do with it. Yeah, we'll see about that. I'm pressing charges. We're gonna take this to court! Wait, now you're charging her? This is confusing. Is dad going to jail? I'll wait for you. Word of advice, dad: Don't tell your cell mate what you're in for. I hope our new dad is a blond. I can't take it anymore! Edith didn't paint the underwear! I did it! What? You painted all those underpants, Linda? Oh, I couldn't help it. Those anuses were haunting me in my sleep. Anus! Anus! Anus! No! You were the one who said we had to support your sister. I did support her, until I figured out a way to destroy her art while preserving her feelings and blaming someone else. I thought those looked familiar. Oh, yeah! Mom! You painted your own underwear! What? How do you know what my underwear looks like? How don't I know? She wears it around the house, flaunting it, like she's all that. I do not! Okay, Bobby, let's go to jail. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Can't I Edith, can't I just pay for the paintings? Well, the retail value of what you destroyed was over a thousand dollars! We'll give you $200. We haven't sold a burger all week, lin. We don't have that kind of money. I got this one, dad. Are we good here? Fine! We'll take it. Me and you can settle up later. Where the hell'd you get all that money from? Shh. Don't ask, don't ask. It's art crawl. But Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shut your mouth. It's art crawl. What but I Shh! Shut your mouth. But the m Shut your mouth. I I said shut your mouth. It's art crawl.

So what are we catering? That sounded promising. Oh, it's a real big deal, Bobby. It's a fund-raiser for Tina's conflict resolution club. Colleen Caviello made the food last year. This year she can go Blow a balloon. Yay! You're catering our fund-raiser. That's great. How much does it pay? Nothing. Nothing? It's a benefit, Bobby. It's a spaghetti dinner.

That's a, that's a great cause. You weren't there, Bob! You don't know how awful it was. This is delicious. Oh my God, I love this ziti. They love my ziti. And that was the worst day of my life. Anyway, this isn't about Colleen, this is about Tina. We're raising money to buy a bulletproof trash can so gang members can finally throw out their guns. Aw. And we're teaching conflict resolution skills you can use in your own lives. That's right, Tina. And Mr. Frond is running the whole thing. Ugh, Mr. Frond? He's a tall drink of Annoying.

So, I'm gonna use this guitar to stand up to Choo-Choo like Banjo. That's, uh That's great, Gene. But I think your face is wrong. My face is wrong?! Yeah, you should do the Banjo icy stare. Like this? No. Not like that. No, no, no. Don't growl. That Like this? Hmm. Maybe try that. Is Choo-Choo scared of stroke victims? Terrified. Hey, Gene, Gene. How do you plead? I'm innocent.

That's right, whoa. These samples are gonna get us our rent money tonight, so we can keep this place. How are free samples gonna get us money? They'll try the samples, and they'll love 'em, but they'll want more. More! They'll be craving these burgers, itching to get their fix! Like heroin. - That's right son, like heroin! - Yes! But this family's gonna have to execute perfectly to pull this off where's Louise? This one shall have his first gig. This one shall slow dance upon that one.

No, you're not. Yeah. I'm allergic. Remember our first date? Yeah, I remember our first date. You were a nervous wreck.   I was having an allergic reac never mind. Hey, what are you guys looking at over there? Um, nothing. Just pictures of people Doing it. Oh. Hey, wait a minute. That's not porn. You brought a Lobsterfest brochure into this house? Can we please go this year? Absolutely not. Ugh! But there's so much fun stuff happening. Unveiling of the world's largest butter vat, for instance. The coronation of the Lobster queen and her court of lovely Lobster maidens. Entertainment by John van horton & the music extrusion. Mm. I do love those guys. As a matter of fact, gene, you were conceived to a jvh song. And I plan to return the favor. Oh, great. I mean, hi, Hugo. You know, I couldn't help but notice, Bob, uh, yours is the only window on the street without a Lobsterfest poster in it. Yeah. Why might that be? Well, because Lobsterfest is stupid! What? I'll handle this, Ron. Put the sign up. It's the law. -It's the law? -Martial law. I'm grand marshal of the fest this year! Hugo, such a fancy sash. You look like sissy spacek in Carrie. Ha. Oh, thank you. But, Hugo, as a health inspector, you must know how disgusting Lobsters are, right? They're bottom feeders that eat garbage all day. Huh, they like garbage? Then they must eat here! In your face, Bob. And now in your window! Come on, Ron. Let's make like a Lobster and get the shell out of here. All right. Hey, my two best customers! Two burgers coming up. No burgers for me, Bob. I'm saving my appetite for Lobsterfest. None for me either, Bobby. I just come by to show you my new Lobster cracker. Check it out titanium with butter-resistant grips. It's the one the astronauts used. Teddy, you think the astronauts brought a Lobster cracker to space? Yeah. That's what it says on the box. Look. ""The one the astronauts used in space!"" I spent $49 on this. Hey, I bet you kids are old enough to crack your own claws this year, right? We don't celebrate Lobsterfest. What?! We're like Jews on Christmas. Or Jews for Jesus on hanukkah. Or me at a lesbian bar. Last night. Watched a hockey game at a lesbian bar, Bob. It was like I was invisible. Uh And who knows the name of the delicious paste that collects here in the pancreas? Tomalley! Correct. Excuse me, miss labonz? Yes, Louise. My family doesn't observe Lobsterfest. I should be excused from class, and/or given an a. Thank you. Good night. Louise, I don't normally use this argument, but if everyone else is doing it, you should, too. Huh. Attention, students. The tropical storm has changed course and has been upgraded to a hurricane. It could hit town at any moment. Don't worry. We have an emergency plan. It's called ""talking it through."" Now, who here thinks the hurricane was caused by something bad they did? What about you, Nicholas? That thing you told me? In confidence? Say it. I rub my genitals on the couch. Mm-hmm. We're all gonna die because of you! It's weather only a Lobster could love, but sadly, there will be no Lobsterfest. This reporter is getting his bib off. Ha, ha! Stupid, failure weatherman, and your failed Lobsterfest. Where's your ugly red sea bug God now?! All right, hold hands. Come on, down to the basement. Bob, we have to close. A hurricane is coming! I know. Isn't it great? Lobsterfest is cancelled! So this town is gonna be crawling with empty bellies ready to eat Bob's burgers, baby! Bob, you're crazy. I think you're crazy! 'Cause it's crazy not to sell burgers during a hurricane! Bob's burgers is open for business! Oh. Is that all you got, storm? Wind chimes! Aah! Bob, I'm not sure staying open is safe. Suppose the hurricane tears right through here. I'll chance it! Look who I found trying to stay dry in the bounce house. The entire royal court of Lobster maidens. Oh, you poor things! Welcome, your highnesseses. Uh, you are henceforth known as the royal cows. Bob! Ah, well, something like that. I'll go throw on some burgers. Hot coffee coming up! I'd really rather get my lips around that beer tap. Hi, guys. Hey, Gretchen! Hi! Oh, Lobster maiden! Teddy, this is Gretchen. She cuts my hair. How you doing? Hey, are you still working nights at the cop bar? Nah, there was a groping incident. I apologized, but they fired me anyway. Oh, she's too much. Really is. Hey, you open? Mm-hmm. You got food? Yup. Beer? Absolutely! Atmosphere? Yeah nnnn eh Ah, good enough. Whoa, Bobby. I think this might develop into a party type situation! You kids stay down in the basement. I already picked a corner for the bathroom. That one, where I went. And I picked that corner. Hey, we've got two bathrooms! Mom, I'm coming up! Just stay down there. They're gonna need you to help repopulate the earth when this is all over. Ew! You want us to mate with each other?! No, you'll mate with the other kids in other basements. Keep talking. All right! Jvh unplugged! Look at all that wet gray hair. Oh, Bobby, look at Hugo. Oh, and poor wet Ron. Yeah. Isn't it hilarious? Bobby. All right, I'll let 'em in. I just want to give 'em a pressed ham first. Stop it! Come on, let me. All right. Sorry for using all of your napkins. I want to thank you for bringing us in, Bob. It was totally Linda's idea. She is so damn considerate! You have everything, and I have nothing. God, so alone! Mm. Lobsterfest was all I had. And now that's gone, too. Look at me. I'm a joke! Yeah, that's too bad. Hey, Bobby, some of the Lobster maidens are open to the idea of a wet gown contest. Want to put up a prize? Uh, how about a towel? Ha! Oh, my God. That's so funny. Gretchen, have you, uh, met Hugo? He was gonna be grand marshal at, uh, Lobsterfest. Ooh. Nice sash. Ever take it off? Well, actually, on Monday, I have to dry-clean it and give it back. Uh, Hugo, Gretchen is into authority figures. Cops, firemen, even mailmen, if they have an important route. Oh, my gosh. So am I! What, you're into mailmen? Well, if they have an important route. I think what Bob's saying is, she likes a man with a badge. You have a badge. Hey, Gretchen! Huh? Hey, Hugo's also a health inspector. That's like being a food sheriff. This is my badge. Mm. Kind of small. You got a gun? Uh, no. Actually, I'm not, uh Mm. Licensed to carry a firearm. I do have a food safety thermometer, and it's very sharp. Pull it out, Hugo. Yeah, pull it out, Hugo. Whoa! Watch out. Here it is. Ooh. ""Unsafe range."" I like my pork a little pink.   Tina, what are you doing? I'm working on my mating list for when we have to repopulate the world. Let me see. Gay. Gay. Mythical creature. Gay mythical creature. Mm. Good luck. Guys, we're wasting time here. We got to sneak out. Sneak out? But there's a hurricane. That's my point. We should be out there, in the wind and rain, looting! Looting?! So how do we do this looting thing exactly? It's easy. You grab anything that's not nailed down. Anything? Like this brick? It's yours. Free brick! Free quarter. Free phone numbers. Free seaweed. Gene, free plywood. Whee! Hey, Bob, the cash register won't open, and you're serving burgers so fast, I don't even know who to get an iou from. Relax, Linda. I'll take care of it. Ugh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen up, listen up. You're all my friends. And friends don't charge friends. The burgers are free, people! Everything is gonna be free! Bob, I thought the point of staying open during a hurricane was to make money! This is way more important than money, lin! Lobsterfest is dead. Bobsterfest killed it! Long live Bobsterfest! Looting is hard. Ah, I think I'm getting loot glutes. This stuff sucks. Let's go home. Hello. What have we here? Maybe he's lost. Check his collar. Get him, gene! Looks like this little guy got into some office supplies. Yeah, those rubber bands don't look comfortable. You should take 'em off. Aah! This is our one chance to see What everyone else is talking about. - What do you mean? - Aah! We're gonna eat Lobster tonight! But that goes against everything we were raised to believe in! Aah! It doesn't go against everything. Okay, but it's a start. Aah! Now's our chance to taste the forbidden fruit that has been kept from us our whole lives. Are you with me? Yeah! Okay. And one man's generosity has turned Lobsterfest into bobsterfest. We're trying to get a word with Bob himself here. I love you, Scott bags! Yeah, there's a cable on that. You can't go all the way over there. You come with me! Yeah, okay. You come with me! Can I can I get my mic back, please? You come up and get it. Give me the mic! Bob! Bob! Bob! Whoa! Oh, wow! This feels weird! Hey, bro. Did I hook you up or what, Hugo? Hey, where are we going now? Over here? Who decides which way we go? There's Linda, my wife! Hey, Linda, you look mad. Let's go the other way. Turn around. Bye, Linda. How you feeling, Bob? What? Oh, my God. Lin! The restaurant's destroyed. The hurricane swept right through here we got hit! Actually, the hurricane missed us, Bob. It's beautiful out. You were the hurricane, schmuck! Hey, Gretchen. Do you have some sweat pants I can put on? Uh Linda. I don't feel well. I can't even look at you. I don't feel well. I did this? You and the mob you incited with free beer and burgers. Oh, who bent my little spindle thing? That's what you notice?! Okay, lin, it looks bad now, but we made a lot of new friends last night. Once word spreads that Bob needs help, this place will be jammed again. The biggest problem is gonna be finding a job for everybody who wants one. Gee, I'm worried about this; I really love it.   Okay, technical problems from last night have been resolved. Hair dryer plus waffle iron plus toaster equals boiling water. So how do we kill this guy before we boil him? We could teach the Lobster to drive and wait until it gets into an accident. Or we could hire an assassin. No, idiots, you boil Lobsters alive. What?! That doesn't sound right. Yep. Until he's dead. And then we boil him some more. Here we go. Wait, this does not feel right. Doing it in a dark room with toilet paper around my neck? I thought my first time eating Lobster would be special. And now please join Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy junior as they eat their first Lobster! Mmm, mmm I thought my first time eating Lobster would be different, too. Gene! Gene! They're waiting for you in the hot tub, gene. Excellent! Whee! And the next day do it again same songs, different Lobsters. What's the matter with you two? Come on, Louise, is this really how you imagined your first time? Yes. Okay, not quite. Louise, today you pay the super price for your super crimes. Enjoy your last meal. It'll do just fine In a pinch! Aah! Maybe we have been rushing things. I want to wait till I'm ready. Let's not give in to peer pressure. Let's release the Lobster back into the supermarket from whence he came! I guess you're right. Looks like this guy'll be the one that got a whoa! Woops! I guess we're having Lobster. It was meant to be. When you get married, just pretend it's your first time eating Lobster. No problem. Down it comes! This stunning butter sculpture, the likeness of Julia child, was made from every available stick and pat of butter within the local and outlying communities. Oh! And there goes Julia's feet! What?! Lobsterfest is back on? Hey, guys, um, you're not going to Lobsterfest, are you? Uh Uh I'm in kind of a bind, fellas. There's a mailbox in the middle of my restaurant. Oh! Can you mail this for me? Wait. Hey, guys? There he is, my buddy, Hugo! Hi. Oh, hi, Bob. Hi, Bobby. What are you both doing right now? My, uh, place, uh, happened to get destroyed last night. Oh, really? Yeah. In the middle of Bob, I'm very busy. I have tables and tables of bisque to judge. Hey, I hooked you two up last night, and you guys kind of broke the baby-changing station in the bathroom. Slap him with a citation, Hugo. I want to watch. Baby likes civil authority? Yes, I love civil authority. I'll show baby civil authority. Stilts guy! You fell through my window. Lot of glass on the floor. Where you going? Got to go, Bob! If I stay still too long, I fall over! P-people! Wait! Stop! Wait! People! Do you think you can just ignore me?! Well, as far as accidental death goes, this one was pretty tasty. I feel tingly. Do you feel tingly? I think he's having an allergic reaction. We should do something. Yeah, let's sit on him and see if he pops. No, we should take him to Lobsterfest. They have a medical tent. And I could get more Lobster! Oh, pop! I'm trying! Let's hear it for John van horton and the music extrusion! Uh, it's me. Bob! Bob. Bob. Bob. Okay Settle down. Listen, what's going on here? What are we doing? Last thing I remember, you were all in my place and it was bobsterfest. I want to get back to that. Let's go back to that! Or at the very least, come with me right now and help me clean up the restaurant! Not all at once. Clean it yourself! Whoa, dad's on the stage at Lobsterfest. My eyes don't work. Paint me a word picture. Kids? What are you doing here? Nothing. What's wrong with gene? He looks horrible. He looks like he always looks. No, he doesn't. Does he? Looks like an allergic Did you eat Lobster?! I, uh He refuses to answer that. What's wrong with you people! Look at my son! Hello. You did this! You and your disgusting food fetish! Bob, get off the stage! You're disorderly. Oh, yeah? Maybe I should get disorderly with this Lobster pot here. That's right, you heard me you trash my restaurant, I trash Lobsterfest, starting with this Lobster pot. Ow! It's hot. Let's leave that alone. Oh, but I-I see some butter. You wouldn't like it if someone messed with your precious butter! Like stuff a big, hairy toe in it! Bob, put your foot back in your sock slowly. I'm authorizing myself to use my brand-new beanbag gun to subdue you. Excuse me, I'm sorry, excuse me, excuse me. Bob! No! This isn't you! This is me, Linda! This is the me that they made! And look what they did to our son. That's not how he normally looks, is it? Bobby, listen to me. Excuse me, I'm sorry, oh You don't have to keep moving! You're not a bottom-feeder, Bob! No, I'm not a bottom-feeder. I'm a burger man. All right, I'm leaving. I'm sure that's what everybody wants. Oh, what happens if I oh, woops! Ow! Bobby, are you okay? Excuse me, uh, excuse me. Oh, my God! All the butter's been contaminated by Bob, and there isn't any more in town! Bob destroyed Lobsterfest! Can't you just eat Lobster without butter? No! How? That's an outrage! Well, why don't you call it butterfest? It brings out the succulence, jerk! Yeah! So what should we do with him? Throw him in the shell pile! Shell pile? Shell pile! Shell pile! Shell pile! Shell pile! Shell Oh, boy. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Maybe Bob shouldn't have threatened your butter, and he definitely should have charged you for the burgers. Boo! But he opened his beautiful heart last night, and you boiled it alive like a Lobster! All you're doing is making us angrier! Shell pile! Shell pile! Sorry, Bobby, I used a bad analogy. Hugo, this doesn't seem right. What? I have a girlfriend; Bob's about to be thrown on to a shell pile I've had this exact fantasy. Come on, Hugo. If Bob hadn't been your wingman last night, you'd be another lonely guy in a satin sash. I was doing fine! I don't need a wingman! Oh, no?  Wingman   flying with the eagles   wingman   he's trying to help you out   wingman   wingman, wingman   wingman, wingman  Agh! Damn it, Ron! All right, attention, people! Stop it, everyone! Slow down! I'm the health inspector. Someone once told me that's like being the food sheriff. This vat of butter isn't contaminated by Bob until I say so! I have with me a dairy purity spectrometer. Oh Now, give me some room. Give him some room! Thank you, Gretchen. Ow! You stabbed me! That's just epinephrine. You're in anaphylactic shock. Mm, you're a handsome shrimp. You just jumped to the top of my list. It's a mating list for when the world ends. Can I get your e-mail? No. I have finished my butter analysis. Bob's skin flakes, arm hair and fingernail dirt are all present. No! That's disgusting! Let me finish! They're present, but not at threatening levels. The butter is grade c to d-minus. Fit for everyone except babies and people with compromised immune systems. In other words, get your bib on! Man, that was the best Lobsterfest ever. Yeah. Turns out people are hard on the outside and soft on the inside. Like, uh Like, uh Uh Oh, I don't know, like a like a crab. Yup. People are just like crabs. And we witnessed the birth of a new tradition every year on Lobsterfest Eve, we trash Bob's place. No, no, no, no. Right? Let's start now! Gene, you swear you didn't have Lobster? You've always looked like this? I was born like this. Uh, I need a picture to compare. Oh, my God, you do always look like this. Hello, gorgeous! Bob, Linda. Hey, Hugo. Where's Gretchen? She's a firecracker, that Gretchen. You sure she's not more than you can handle, Hugo? Gretchen just broke up with me. She said she was more than I could handle. Oh. It was ugly. She said she didn't mind a small badge, but said I didn't know how to use it, Bob! Ow. Ouch. Oh, that's too bad. I don't need your pity! So, here we are. - Surprise inspection! - Oh. Pencil! Pencil. Pad! Pad. Ooh, bent spindle. Ron! Shut it down!"
"Bob's Burgers! Fresh ground meat! Great atmosphere! Gene, bring it in. Get out of that burger suit. We're going. Baseball waits for no one. It smells like urine. Did you pee in that? I had to go! I told you not to pee in it after I cleaned up from the I'm the only one who wears it. What's the difference? Oh, my God. What, you don't want to buy burgers from a guy who smells like pee? No one can place where it's coming from. I can't believe you'll close the restaurant to go to a baseball game. Louise, this isn't just a game. We bought an ad at the ballpark. That's worth closing for, right? Oh, can't wait to see it! It's gonna be so exciting. We're famous. It looks like a hot dog wrapper's stuck in the net. Like, a really tiny hot dog. I did think it was gonna be a little bigger. I think more people would see your ad if it was a urinal cake. Are you kidding? I wish I could afford a urinal cake ad. All this talk about cake is making me hungry. I'm gonna flag down the ice cream sandwich guy. Hey! Play ball! Welcome to opening day of minor league baseball. Let's hear it for your Wonder Wharf Wonderdogs! Please give a big Wonderdog welcome to Phe-Nom, the Korean bunt specialist! I never realized baseball had so much butt-touching. That's how they communicate, Tina. It's like Braille, but with butts. Read this! I'm bored. Boredom. Boring sports. Hey, it's the seventh- inning stretch. Time for the mascot race. Well, hello! Please welcome the owner of the Wonderdogs, Mr. Calvin Fischoeder! Fish! It's that time. Now cheer for your favorite mascot! Mr. Fischoeder owns the team? He owns the ballpark, the team, Wonder Wharf. I'm gonna marry that man. No, you're not. I wanna be rich! Don't be frightened. I have a gun! So, get set Where has this sport been all my life? You know, I wear the burger costume all the time. Maybe I could race in one of these races, Dad. I bet it's impossible to get in, Gene. I'm sure you gotta know someone. You do. It's Mr. Fischoeder, our landlord. The winner! Well, I can't ask a favor of a guy I've never paid rent on time to. You're his son, Gene. He'll ask him. Yay! No, I won't. Now taking the mound to pitch, former major league sensation, Torpedo Jones! That can't be the same Torpe Kids, that's the Torpedo Jones! I can't believe he's still playing. God, he, he must be my age. I speak for everyone here when I say I don't know what a Torpedo Jones is. Let me tell you, nobody We don't care. Gene, let me finish. Nobody That's what I was trying to prevent. Nobody pitched like Torpedo. I was there for his ""The Pitch!"" It was 15 years ago, but I remember it like it was ten. His pitch was the split-finger skadootch. Torpedo clinched the pennant for us with that pitch. If he's so good, why have we never heard of this guy? Well, because he didn't last long in the bigs. You know, the skadootch is just one of those pitches. When it was on, it was really on. But when it wasn't it's like hitting candy out of a baby's hand with a bat. Wait. You mean it's hard because babies hands are so small? No, it's easy because How could you hit a baby? Nobody would hit a baby's hand with a bat in real life. I don't understand. Was he fired from the bigs 'cause he hit a baby with a bat? I'm not interested in talking to you anymore. Sorry, Gene. I don't see Fischoeder anywhere. Let's get going. That's all right. I only wanted to do it really, really bad. Oh! There's Torpedo! Dad, ask Torpedo about the mascot races. Maybe he can get Gene in. Yeah! Kids, come on. I can't bother Torpedo. He's, like, my role model. Oh, that's creepy. Your role model is the same age as you? I would never have another nine-year-old as my role model. Hey, Torpedo! My dad is a huge scout for the Baseball League of America! Kidding. But he has a favor to ask you. Hi, I'm a huge fan. You know, I was there for ""The Pitch."" So, uh, what can I do for ya? Picture? Autograph? Three bucks each, both for five. Uh, yeah, both would be great. Dad! Oh, and my kid wants to run in the mascot race. You don't think Hey, Russell! Some kid here wants to run in a mascot race. For you, Torpedo, I'll make it happen. I gotta free up one of these outfits. No, you don't! I got my own. It's a burger. Easy enough. Thanks a lot, Torpedo. Good luck out there, sport. Linda, did you, did you hear that? Torpedo Jones called me ""sport."" He didn't call you ""sport,"" he called Gene ""sport."" No, he was looking right at me. Yeah, he called me ""sport"" and he tussled my hair. It was great, Gene. You were great. I'm a great tussle receiver. Wow, wearing the burger suit in the mascot race, Gene. That's advertising, huh? Don't touch me! It was so nice of Torpedo to give us these seats so we can watch Gene's race. You can really make out the players' tattoos from here. Makes you wonder about the tattoos we can't see. On their butts. How you doing, Gene? You feeling fast? No, I feel queasy. Got some butterflies, Ace? Torpedo! Want my advice, kid? It's a mascot race; all you gotta do is stay on your feet. Let the other guys trip over themselves. It's time for the mascot race! Whoo-ee! Goodie. Remember, you're an ambassador for our restaurant, so just y y and run well, 'cause you don't run well. Good luck out there, sport. Oh. Yeah, I thought earlier you called me ""sport,"" so Nah, that was, that was a nickname for the kid there, Flash. I'll take Flash. Kids, call me Flash from now on. Let's split the diff and call you Stinky. Stinky! I like it! Oh, Torpedo, here's a little thank you for getting Gene in the race. I make burgers for a living, so it's not weird for me to give you this. I don't think it's weird at all, Bob. Like a good burger. Mmm. That's a good burger. Finish this guy back on the mound. Ha! Torpedo Jones just said I make a good burger! I want that on my tombstone. Seriously, okay? No, I already got your tombstone picked out for ya. What, what is it? It says, ""Order up."" That's good. Let's go with that one. Joining your Wonder Wharf mascots today is a special guest food, a burger! A boy who is also a burger. And I have my gun. Ready, set Go get 'em, Gene! I reinforced the crotch so he wouldn't tear it. Win, Gene! Avenge Dad's death! Down goes Sammy Sea Lion! Ooh! It's a two-mascot race! Burger and Captain Pel I. Can. There they go, like two, fast, fiery bew! The burger is your winner! Well, congratulations, young burger. Ladies and gentlemen, you can purchase delicious burgers that look somewhat like him right here at the park. And at my family's restaurant. And, uh, what's the name of that restaurant? Ah it's, it's Bob's Burgers! God, I'm there every day. Bob's Burgers! It's Oh, God Gene! No! Never mind. Never mind. That's okay. Bob's Burgers! Oh, my God! You can get everything you expect from a burger at whatever the name of his restaurant is Oh, oh, I just remembered! I just remembered! It's too late. But you can get them here at the park, today. No! Say it! I won something! I won! I won! I won something! Yeah, and you didn't fall down like everyone else. Tell that to your grandkids. I will. Gene, are you kidding me?! The name of the restaurant is Bob's Burgers! Well, I call you Dad! I think of it as Dad's Burgers! You live above it! You work in it every day! Bob, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm fine. I'm fine. He did great. You did great, Gene. A gold medal! Oh, we should get that bronzed! Strike three. You're out! Torpedo's split-finger skadootch has suddenly started clicking. I love that burger of yours, Bob. Hey, after the game, let's all go to Bob's Burgers! Whoo! Now that's advertising, huh? Ooh, Angel! Do they call you that 'cause you're such a good boy? I did many bad things to escape Cuba. Things that haunt me in the dark of the night. Aw How about another beer? Man, you kids got a great dad, you know that? One wife. One family. That's the way to do it. You know, in the majors, most guys got a whole bunch of families spread out over the 50 states. When spring training starts, you get your Florida wife. When it's regular season, it's open season, if you know what I'm talkin' about. You kiss your home field wife and kids good-bye, you tell 'em you'll miss 'em, and you do. But you still take some of their toys and re-gift 'em for your away kids. I bet you're a great dad. And three great husbands. Mr. Torpedo, I couldn't help but notice that the tall boy was looking a little lethargic. Yeah, he's got Lupus or rickets or somethin'. I don't know why we keep giving that job to these sick kids. I was wondering if I could offer my services. I'm very healthy. Okay, okay, okay. Whoa, whoa. Hey, you got the job. Just stop doing that. Here's your first ball girl duty: bringing me one of your dad's burgers before every gam Okay. Here's the tabacco you wanted. And your comic books. Phe-Nom, is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? You're my favorite. Don't tell Angel. He's fiery. Strike three! Sound the alarm because Torpedo is on fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Not a good idea, Burt. It's a crowded stadium. That Torpedo is amazing! Has he always been this good? No, he hasn't been good in a long time. He says my burgers have helped him pitch better. How does a burger help someone pitch better? Here ya go, Bob, little souvenir. Thanks, buddy! Whoa, slippery. It's greasy, huh? What does this smell like? Hey, stop sniffing Torpedo's balls. Get it? It's like you're in love with him. Wait. That's our burger. Oh, crap. Torpedo's putting my grease on the ball. That's how his skadootch is skadootching so much. Your hero's using your burger grease to win. That's great! No, Lin, Torpedo is using my burger grease to cheat. Oh. So you helped Torpedo cheat. If that means the Wonderdogs keep coming to the restaurant bringing all sorts of business with them, I say big whoop, let the old man throw a greasy skadootch. Strike two! I don't even know what to think about this. I gotta go take a leak. Oh, get me an ice cream in a mini-helmet! Bob. You look glum. Oh, I, uh You don't hold your when you pee. Why? It's not going anywhere. Okay. Um, well, what if you found out that someone you knew was doing something sort of bad, and you were helping them do that sort of bad thing Is it me? Is it abortions? Wait. What? Uh, what were you saying? Torpedo Jones is greasing the ball, and he's using my grease to do it. Mm-mm. Oh. Come walk with me. Come behind the scenes! Torpedo's dazzling pitching is putting more butts in seats than this stadium can handle. Is the roller coaster going to be okay without those huge planks of wood? Sure, sure! These people aren't paying for extra wood, Bob. No one wants to ride Extra Wood Mountain. Whoa! Watch out! Extra nuts and bolts. Ow! People come to baseball games for the same reason they come to the amusement park: To be entertained! Does it really matter if the games are rigged? No! The games are rigged? Yes! Oh. My wonderdog is hanging out. Yes. Yes, it is. I got so caught up in our conversation, I forgot to zip. Yeah, I didn't want to say anything. Why not? I, uh Compliments are welcome. Where was I? You were saying the games are rigged. Yes. The games are all rigged. I'm not letting my kids play these games anymore. But look at these smiling faces. Just like those smiling faces. Smiling at every skadootch the Torpedo throws. They don't want to know, Bob. They don't want to look behind the curtain. I don't know. It just seems like bad karma or something. Karma? There's no such thing as karma. Not in this town. Oh, just kick 'em. Kick 'em right into the ocean! Okay. That's it. Wait, why does Tornado want our old grease in a jar? It's Torpedo, Gene. Oh. Uh, it helps him pitch better. And-And don't forget, it's a secret. Why? Is it against the rules? Technically, yes. So then it's cheating. No. What it is, is helping people enjoy baseball more. It's entertainment. I'm confused. Are you and Mom getting divorced? What? Oh, my God, you are. I call Mom! I call Dad! You guys took both of them. Enough. Go fill the condiments. I call ketchup! I call mustard! Aw You can do horseradish. There's not okay. Thanks, Bobby. Hey, who wants a burger? On the Torpedo! Hooray! Gene, you're defending your title. Are you nervous? Why don't you ask my diarrhea. You should be nervous. You're a chubby kid in a mascot suit. That's what I'm saying. I should cheat. Dad says it's okay when it's for entertainment. That's right! Let's cheat! - You see that pelican? - Yeah. You're running, right? You have a switchblade taped to your shoe. He does? He will. And on your other shoe, you'll have a lemon. Stab! Stab! Stab! Sting, sting, sting! ""What are you doing?"" ""I'm squeezing lemon into your wound!"" Sweet baby blade foot. Or I can give him a nudge and tip him over. Ugh, really? Yeah. He's top-heavy. I'll just give him a little tippity-tap. Well, I'm still gluing a knife to my foot. Yay, Gene! Go, Gene! That-a-way, son! Tippity-tap. Ooh! It's a three-mascot pileup! Go, Gene! All right! Go! The Boy Burger wins again! How about that? Hey, how about this, Phil? I don't know, Burt. I'm not so sure about that. Yay! I won! I won again! My brother won! Guys, take off your shirts. Good arm pumping, baby! That's how I disguised the push. What push? He pushed the Cotton Candy mascot so he'd fall over. Hooray for cheating! Gene, how could you? You know that's wrong. Uh-uh. Not when it's entertainment. You said it yourself. You told them cheating is okay? No, I didn't, Linda. Yes, he did. Oh, Bobby. Oh, crap. Go get me a soft serve. And make it a swirl! Look, Gene, when I said it's okay to cheat, I meant for Torpedo, not for you to cheat in your mascot race. You should really give back one of those medals. Ooh, but I want to get a picture of you wearing them before you do. I'm not giving back my medals! Those suckers got their money's worth, Pops. I'm good for business, Dad. You know what? From now on, there'll be no more cheating. Does that mean I shouldn't give Torpedo this grease? That's right, Tina. Yes. No more cheating for anyone in this house. From now on, I won't wear my tummy tuck jeans. And good-bye, Brazilian. Hello, rain forest. Sorry, Dad. But if I win tomorrow, I'll be the first mascot ever to win three races in a row. I'm a top! You mean you're on top. No. I'm a top! Shew. I was starting to think maybe you were going to leave me high and dry here. Well, what's in this jar is worth the wait. What the? ""You don't need to cheat. ""You can win without me. ""If you try your hardest, you've already won. Love, Bob's grease."" That's right, Torpedo. You can win without my grease. It just took me believing in you. Now, listen. Gene's about to race, and since you're his role model, I'm hoping you'll tell Gene he can win without cheating, just like you. Who the hell's Gene? That's my son. You're his role model, and you're my role model, too. Wh? I can't be your role model; we're the same age. What's this mean? You cutting me off, Bob-o? Torpedo, I'm cutting you free. Come here. Wait, what are you going to do? I'm going to hug you. Slow down there, tiger. Guess I'll have to make this grease last the whole season. I should have never given you my grease. I created a monster. You think you started my greasing? I've always cheated, Bobby. Not the ""The Pitch."" Oh, definitely ""The Pitch."" That game, I had a pat of butter in my nostril, sex jelly in my armpit Hell, I was on prescription drugs to stimulate production of earwax. And ""The Pitch""? That was courtesy of some black market whale blubber I bought off some Eskimos. Cute note, though, Bob. Bit of advice: if you want a role model, pick an old guy. By the time you grow up, they're dead. Didn't go great. Gene! I'm sure it was fine. Torpedo seems like a reasonable guy. Torpedo Jones wants you out of his seats this second. What a schmuck. Gene! It's the seventh-inning stretch. Mascots are lining up. All right, maybe I have an idea. Hi, fellas. I'd love to say a few words to my son, the burger, over the P.A. Excuse me. Uh okay. Highly unusual. Doesn't matter. None of this matters. Gene. BOB (over P.A. Up here. Jesus? No, Gene, it's your father. I'm up here. You're dead?! Yes. No, I'm-I'm kidding. I'm up here in the booth. Right here. See me? Boy, this microphone smells like beer. Well, let's just say AA was ""A"" waste of time. Winning isn't everything, Gene. Yes, we're all here to be entertained, but if you, um, cut corners now, the next thing you know, you'll be hiding lard in your nose or taking wood out of roller coasters. Hey, all right, that's enough of that. Let's start the race! I'm trying to talk to my son. Gene, run clean. On your mark! Gene, what are you going to do? I don't know. You're going to cheat! That's what you're going to do! You're going to win by cheating! Who wants to see the burger win three in a row? Gene, listen to me. You know what to do. Bob triple crown for burger. Good for your business. See?! No, Gene! Don't worry about the advertising. What are you doing? It's a starter's pistol. It's a real gun. You should get down. What?! Stop shooting! This is crazy. Oh, good. He stopped. He's just out of bullets. And down goes Cotton Candy! It's a two-mascot race. Gene. Do the right thing. Yeah. You can win on your own, Gene! Probably. Hey All right. Fine. Whoa, whoa! Don't push him! He was going to push you! Congratulations to Captain Pel I. Can! Oh, Gene. Sorry, buddy. I mean, looks like karma caught up to you. Bob, I told you there's no such thing as karma. Uh, yes there is. No, I'm afraid there isn't! I'm afraid there is. Is not. Oh, crap. See, Gene. This is what happens when you cheat. That was incredible! Cheating is amazing! Oh. Bob? Oh. Uh, hi. Sorry about your roller coaster. Ah, roller coasters come and go. But Bobs are once in a lifetime. I admire you. You do? You remind me of my father. He was honest, and he worked hard. You an immigrant, Bob? Um no. Just swarthy? I guess. What's ""swarthy""? Um, dark and hairy. That's you! And me in the future. Well, unlike you, my father made a fortune. But in many other ways, you guys are the same. Two decent, swarthy peas in a pod. One rich and one just scraping by. Thanks. Well, we're off to get a massage. Come on, Wonderdog. Down, boy. He's gone, Dad. My future husband's gone. You drove him away! Tina, what you got there? The team signed a ball so I'd have something to remember them by. And I took this jockstrap. Okay, sweetie. Let's throw that in the wash. No. Come on, give it to me. Mm-mm. Do you know how many venereal diseases those baseball players have? I don't care. Whose was it? Smells like Angel. Angel. But don't tell Phe-Nom."
"Dig, Gene! Show me the treasure! Maybe it's some tin foil and we can recycle it. Maybe it's a shovel, and I won't have to dig with my hands. Look! It's a watch! Ollie? How long have you been down there? Where's Andy? He was supposed to unbury me. There you are! I've been digging all over for you! Is your brother around? He's over there playing with Zeke. Okay, Jimmy Jr., put me in a crotch-lock and see if I can get out of it. Zeke. This is why I'm only friends with women. - Pull the key out! - They're on the wrestling team together. - Pull the key out! - I could help you practice, Jimmy Jr. Tomorrow's good for me. Thanks, but me and Zeke are going to watch them demolish that taffy factory tomorrow. We're gonna watch it get blowed up. Boom! - Scoop. - Ow! Ah! Tina, Gene, let's go. We've got a whole beach to comb. - Yes, sir. - I'm good. Come on! Hah! Bobby, want to come over and watch the game tonight? I'm making a three-bean salad, but it's bring your own bean. Can I put you down for garbanzo? No. Nah, he can't. Bob's got plans tonight. Yeah, Teddy. Um Sunday nights me and Linda have, uh, you know, an arrangement. Oh! Scheduled sex. Eh Do you want to borrow my Sade tape? Guess what we found with our metal detector? Another metal detector! Yay. And I found this on the beach. I think it could help me. Ooh. Passionfruit paperbacks. Juicy! Too bad you kids can't take the metal detector over to Caffrey's taffy factory. Find his secret treasure before they tear the place down. Whoa, whoa, whoa ho, secret treasure? What are you, ah What are you talking about? Whoops, there I go again. Divulging amazing secrets. Yeah, my Uncle Paddy told me about it. He used to work in Caffrey back in the '50s. He was his maid. Your Uncle Paddy was a maid? All maids were men back then. Until women joined the workforce and took all the maid jobs away. All right, girls! Go, girls! A big part of Paddy's job was dusting Caffrey's money. Caffrey didn't make his money from candy, you know. He was a bootlegger! I believe the term is leg-warmer. No it is not, Gene. Anyway, Caffrey ran liquor during Prohibition. There are tunnels under the factory where they brought the booze in with boats at high tide. And the tunnels were booby trapped to keep out the G-men Lousy Feds. Rumor is Caffrey even made a bunch of taffy dummies to guard his operation. Like the Terra Cotta Warriors of ancient China. China. Stick to noodles, right? - Is that racist? - Yes. - A little bit. - No. Anyway, Caffrey didn't trust banks, so he hid all his gold down there in the tunnels. Mm-hmm Uncle Paddy told me about it, and now I'm gonna tell you. There's a secret elevator in the factory that takes you down to the tunnels underneath. - Uh-huh. Continue. - Yep. - Uh You follow the tunnel around the curve till you get to three stones, and then you take the tunnel that bends this way, and there's the treasure! It's a butt! Get it? A butt! With three turds! Eh, Paddy got me good with that one when I was a kid and now I'm paying it forward. Eh Yeah, that's a That's a great one, Teddy. Gold? He was a funny man, that Paddy. Eh A funny male maid. With a serious drinking problem and psoriasis. Kids-only meeting. Now. I'll get Mom. No, Ti-Tina! Kids! Listen, let's go get the taffy factory treasure! We've got the map! But it's just a butt! Teddy was just messing with our heads. Men do that. No, no, this might be real. Think about it. If you had the chance to make a treasure map in a shape what shape would you make it? - Butt. Butt. - Exactly! The factory's getting demolished tomorrow, so we have to go tonight. You guys in? We doing this? I could move some things around. Let's find butt treasure! Oh. Well, I am done. No more chewing for me. Look at the time. Yeah! I'm gonna sleep like a baby. - A horny baby. - Ooh. Ah Great dinner, Mom. You outdid yourself. That was a great day all around. One for the books. I want to go to bed immediately before I spoil it and make it just a regular day. That was easy. That was easy. Gene, you don't need to do that. Their door is shut. I know. My belly itches. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. There it is, guys. Caffrey's treasure is as good as ours. And no one knows about it! What is Jimmy Jr. doing here? I invited him. What?! This book is gonna be my treasure map to Jimmy Jr.'s heart. All I have to do is act like this damsel. Hey, Tina. Oh, sorry I got dirt on your leg. Oh, my. H-How will I ever get clean? - Um, hose it off? Yes. See that fishtail, J-Ju? Zeke?! Jimmy Jr., you don't just invite someone without asking! Yeah! Yeah, we're in agreement on that, Tina! Okay, good. Oh, Tina! Whoo! What are we waiting for? That factory's got windows and I got a passion for smashin'. Heeyah! Anyone else coming? Just Andy, plus one. That's Ollie. We made it! I got a funcussion! Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. That one didn't hurt. Ow! Doofus, Brace-face, Dingle, Berry, Gas Tank, Blabbermouth. Just so you know, we're not sharing the treasure with you, you, you and you. Jimmy, the way the moonlight shines on your hair makes me feel so vulnerable. Yeah it makes me feel like dancing! Yeah, J-Ju, faster! Abandoned warehouse! Pent-up feelings! Footloose it! Don't tell me not to dance, Dad! We need to find that secret elevator and get down to the gold. I can taste every flavor from the past 60 years! I can taste the Korean War! I taste rust. I taste Andy's spit! Come on! What? The elevator! This means Uncle Paddy was right! There's treasure down there! You're welcome. Tonight's gonna be a little special. I got a couple of surprises. Not Teddy's Sade tape Dice? Sexy dice. We roll them and they tell us what to do. Okay. Um, sounds sexy. Ooh, let's ""hug"". On the ""chair."" - So, you're gonna hug on a chair? - Mm-hmm. Come. That's, uh Come to Momma. Ahh. Oh! Get off. Um oh. Get off. There we go, that's better. Whew. So that's it for that. So how do we work this thing? What's this one do? Ah. What's happening? It must be a booby trap! Pull a different lever! No rush. Push the other way! Nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang nang oh, good ear massage. Uh. Oh, Bobby. Aang, nang, nang, nang. All right, let-let's see what we got next. All right? I'm gonna roll. Ugh. I got ""lick"" ""foot"" again. - Lick it like you like it. - No. - Lick it like you like it. - No more lick foot. - Lick it like you like it. Lick - No more lick foot. This little piggy goes all the way home. Hey, let's give these dice a little help. Let's do this and this. That's weird. Well, it's about to get weirder with this and this. No, it's just, do you hear the kids? Huh. They're never this quiet. I'm gonna go check on them. Aw! I knew he didn't take out the garbage. Tina. - Bobby, they're gone! - What do you mean, ""they're gone""? They're not here. I got Tina's diary. Let's see if it says anything. Dear Diary, tonight we're sneaking into the dangerous taffy factory. Also, if boys had utuses they'd be called duderuses. Duderuses. - Bob! They went to the taffy factory! We gotta get them! Really? Yes. All right. Bringing you guys along was a big mistake. Between you inviting half of the town, and you pushing and licking everything in sight like an animal You guys are a burden you are dead weight! What are you doing now, Gene? I'm being courteous! I'm using the fart escape. There's an opening there? Yeah. But it's full of farts. I can fit through there and shimmy down those ropes. I am ditching you dipsticks. Wait! We can fit through there too, and Ollie can see in the dark. And Andy knows all the capitals. Albany, Montgomery, Juneau, Phoenix, - Boston, Montpelier, Helena, Boise - Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket. Or pants Ow. Wash 'em before you return 'em! The treasure's in the crack of the ass, and it's close. I can smell it. Okay, I need one of you in front of me and one of you behind me at all times, in case there are booby traps. Booby, booby, booby, booby. Booby, booby, booby, booby, booby. Sph! Sph! Zip it! Zip it! Oh! Nice try, Caffrey. Would one of you be a lamb and pull that string? Oop. Oh. It was nothing. Was nothing. Well, that was probably more menacing back in the day. This thing's stuck. What should we do now, Jimmy Jr? You're smart. While you guys keep on blabbity blabbity blabbity blabbity blabbity, I'm getting outta here. Yeah. Yeah. You go. Come on, J-Ju. Saddle up! Okay. I mean, hell yeah! Let's do it to this! No! I I mean let's all go! Come on, Gene! I just got comfortable. It took me five minutes to cross my legs. Now! Ugh. I'm okay. He's gone. I thought Jimmy Jr. and I would have a romantic night in the sewer together, like Fabrizio and Fay. Tina, honey, it's pretty obvious Jimmy Jr.'s not into you. And I'm usually not that good at picking up on vibes. Did you know Mom and Dad were a thing? Damn it, Ollie! - I'm Andy. - Damn it, Andy! Louise, which way did you go? - Oh, you can't tell? - That's too bad! Don't follow me! You'd just fall into every single booby trap that has ever Every single trap that's ever been what? Hm. Silent treatment. Kind of weird to start in the middle of a sentence, but whatever. Oh my God, Bobby, I hope we find the kids before they hurt themselves. Oh, oh. Quit poking me with that thing. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I don't understand why is it still here? Well I may have slipped a penis pill into your casserole. Surprise. What? Wh-Why? Sometimes you want to ride a roller coaster twice and you don't want to wait in line. That's crazy. Where where'd you get it? Ginger. She does it with Tony all the time. I want to be edgy like them. Pill-popping sex freaks. Well, what am I supposed to do with this now? That thing made the kids; Maybe it can find them. - Where are they? - You know, come on, get out of there. Come on. Where are they? Show me, girl. Wait. Why is it a girl? 'Cause it's a pretty brunette, like Catherine Zeta-Jones. Oh, crap. Andy! Ollie! Go get help! We're on it! Montgomery, Harrisburg, Las Vegas! That's not a capital! What? I couldn't hear you. Las Vegas is not a capital of Nevada. I didn't say Las Vegas. What'd you say? Oh, just go! Go! Don't tell anyone. Okay. Nothing to get freaked out about. My arm's not stuck in a crevice, so I don't need to cut it off like that impatient idiot. I just cannot stop banging things down here. The acoustics are great. Tina, what song is this? ""Aqua Boogie"" by P-Funk? Yes! Wow. Hey. Hey, you. Tough guy! You want a piece of me? Sticky. Are you made of taffy? Huh. There you go. Not so scary, huh, Taff? Just you and me now a girl and her taffy giant. Classic. Louise! Nice echo. When I say Gene, you say Gene. Gene! Gene! Gene? Ugh. Is that what my voice sounds like? Kids, where are you? We're down here. How did you find us? Because we're your parents and we know everything. Did you read my diary? Yes. Are you okay? Where's Louise? I don't hear Louise. We don't know. She ditched us, and then she ditched us some more. It hurt even more the second time. Uh, did you take this elevator down? Yes, but then we broke it. Well, we'll just jump down to the top and figure it out from there. We figured it out. You okay? How's your penis? It's okay. Mine's a nightmare, if anyone's wondering. Taff, you're not helping. Squishy bastard. Is everyone around me useless? I have to do everything? Okay, I see. Another Taff tantrum, right on schedule. Big news Taff is upset! Everybody gather round! Sorry, Taff. I didn't mean it. You said things, I said things. Friends? Louise! I can't believe you snuck out, and I I still don't understand why you guys split up. She went to find the treasure by herself because we're ""a burden."" Gene, what did I tell you about finger quotes? Not to ""do"" them. But ironic detachment is great. Nothing means anything! Hey, up here! Who the hell is that? We went to get help. I got more blood in my head than a skeeter on a peter. Oh, my God. You really do. All right, hang on a I'll get you guys down. Jimmy, you're looking well. I've been fine. Okay, where's Louise? And that's why I ditched my brother and sister. Don't look at me with your judgmental, hollow eyeholes. What?! Gene and Tina were a liability. This is a treasure hunt! This is a professional operation! You would have left them, too. Well, you weren't there, were you? If they're so great, how come they haven't found me yet? Huh? Huh? Huh?! Louise! Down here! Don't, don't, don't, don't! No one likes an I-told-you-so. Oh, thank God. We'll get you out, baby! Are you all right, Louise? We're fine! Who's ""we""? Me and Taff! Let's just call the fire department, right? There's no service. I hate this freaking phone, Bobby. Lin, we're underground. You can't blame the phone. What, do you work for the phone company now? Bob's Phone Company? What, are you going to beat me up? Get me out of here! - Sorry, Louise. - Yeah, sorry. I have a cheap phone, so you're going to have to stay in there - for the rest of your life. - Your mother was arguing about the phone. Yeah, I did a walk-through. I did it twice. We're good. Get me out of here! Okay. Louise, calm down. Listen, you're not in any danger. What was that? Oh, no. No, no, no, no! Oh, my God. Maybe it's an earthquake. Maybe the neighbors are just moving furniture around. We should probably pray. Uh, dear God, this is Tina from school. I just peed Andy's pants. Warm, warm, warm, cold. Oh, crap. They started the demolition! Hey, so my friend had a three-bean salad party, but it was bring your own bean. Who does that? Don't worry, Louise! We're going to get you out! How are we going to get her out? Maybe we should smoke her out. Louise, are you sure there isn't something down there you can use to climb out? Oh, wait! Here's a grappling hook! Oh, and here's an escalator! - Silly me! - We're about to die, Louise. Do you really want your last words to be sarcastic? No! I got it let's all spit in the pit. Then she can swim to safety. Right, J-Ju? We're all gonna die! Stupid book. I'm sick of acting like a dumb, helpless girl just so a hot boy who dances his feelings will notice me. That's not who I am. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. Oh, God. Now, here's how we'll get Louise out. We'll make a ladder. Everyone, lock your arms like this. The person underneath puts their legs through, and you use your core strength to do the work. Um, my core is super ticklish, so - I don't know, Tina. - No, it'll work. I saw Jimmy Jr. and Zeke do it in wrestling practice. Hey, those practices are closed! I'm aware of that, Zeke. I'm the reason they're closed. All right, let's try it. Louise, grab Gene's hands. Can't reach them! Nobody say anything Louise looks really different. What is that? This is Taff. He's a booby trap that became much more than that. Everybody run! Why is Taff stuck on Dad? Well, sometimes, when a man loves a woman very much Oh, crap. Dead end? Ugh. If I'm going to die, I'm going to play ""Aqua Boogie"" one last time. Hiyah! Gene, not now. Wait. That sounds hollow. Hit it again, Gene, harder. Daylight! Everybody, through here. We made it. We're safe. Um, lots of people out here. Whoa. Your sex night took a weird turn, huh, Bobby? Daddy! Andy? Ollie? Hey, I thought you guys were with your mother. You came for us! I'm just here to watch the demolition. You know, I mean, yes, I came for you. I'm a great father. All right, off, off, off, off, off. You're wrinkling my belt. You know what, Tina? Strong girls are hot. Put it on a T-shirt, Jimmy Jr. I don't want to hear it. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. Get off me, you wuss. Ah, looks like you finally got the starch out of your shirt. Yeah. Finally. Aw, what a waste. Well, we'll try it next Sunday. Please don't drug me again. We'll see. Tina, Gene, Taff made me realize I was a little hard on you two. I said you were useless dead weight, but I was so wrong. Tina, you got me out of that booby trap. And Gene, you actually banged us to freedom. I can't take all the credit. I'd like to thank this brick and Questlove. I'm sorry I was mean to you guys. Eh, I just figured you were having female troubles. What are female troubles? I love you, too, Louise. Aw. And, Taff, what are the words? I love you. You're going to live with me now. You're not taking that filthy thing home. Yeah, you're right. Well, I guess there wasn't any treasure. This butt was just a joke after all. Maybe the journey was the treasure.  Teddy was right  About the treasure  In the butt  The next day you will see  Taff is washed up on the beach   And oh, my God, is that a gold bar?   The wave just washed him out far   The kids didn't look close enough   In the taffy butt  You have a taffy butt  There's treasure in that butt   I want that taffy butt  Ay yi yi yi yi  Taffy butt  It's such a taffy butt  There's gold there in that butt   Give me some taffy butt  Ay yi yi yi yi  Taffy butt  Oh, I want the taffy butt  Give me, give me  Give me some taffy butt  Ay yi yi yi yi."
"So, Bobby, what are we gonna say to the bank manager tomorrow? If we don't get those loans restructured, we're up a creek. Screwed Creek. Don't worry, Lin. I got it all worked out. Very convincing stuff. Let's hear it. All right. Action! As you know, sir, we have several loans with your institution, all ""past due."" But what does ""past due"" even mean, you know? It's brilliant! There's no such thing as time. Gene was past due and he came out fine. I wish I stayed in there! Hey. Get out of there. Gene! Let me in! Let me back in! Gene! Bob! Oh, God. This is your son. Sorry, Gene. No backsies. You can't put the candy back in mom's wrapper. You know, I have a savings account at First Oceanside. So I might have some pull over there. Thanks, Teen, but I think I got this covered. No. Look, I know we owe money and my credit score's on the low side, but It is the low side, Bob. It's kind of an inside joke around here. Hmm. That's funny-- but I would still like you to look at the loan. No. Well, it's really important that Bob, I have to take this call. That's not a phone. Well I I still have to take it. Great. Well, then I will, leave you your piece of paper phone call. I just wish that you nope. You know what, forget it! ""Always on your side."" Ha! I'll make a scene! Um I'm gonna leave. Hey, thanks, man. Whoa! Get a car, idiot! Gonna check on my money. The bank manager didn't go for it. And he was mean. My God, Bobby, what'd you do? Nothing. I just punched a cardboard cutout guy. I didn't even punch it, I just flicked it. Oh, Bobby. Man, I got to do this stupid essay for English class on ""someone important to me."" I'd write about the guy who flies the helicopter on The Bachelor. Look at all those police! This is a good time for me to be stuck in that tree again. Kids! Get in here! Channel six news. They'll finger anything with a pulse. I'm pretty sure their slogan is, their ""finger's on the pulse,"" Gene. No! That can't be right. It's right. Ooh, SWAT team's here. Intense. That guy's important. You can tell by the way he points. He' s fingering right at us! Tell those guys to get behind the barricade, now! There's a hostage situation at the bank. We need this restaurant. This is, um, interesting. The restaurant will get on TV. I know. I was just thinking the same thing. That's a lot of coffee's going out. Write it all down, all the coffees, we got to keep track. Snipers are in position on the roof. Oh, God, that's embarrassing. Our gutters are a mess. Hello. My name's Louise. I would like to donate a piece of my personal chalk in case you need to outline a body. Is my money safe in that bank? What are these kids doing here! U-Uh, they're our kids. They, uh, work-slash-live here. Well, keep them out of the way. You got me? Do I have a hard line yet? Line's up. Who's breathing on my line?! All I know is I was just talking to Ken, and now I'm on hold at the bank. Hey! Everyone shhhh! God, we're making the call. Shut up. This is Sergeant Bosco, and I'm in charge. Uh, who am I speaking with? All right, Mickey, how many people you got in there? Eight. Okay, Mickey, this is what we're gonna do: You Uh-huh. He wants pizza. Oh, come on. They always want pizza. Isn't there an Italian place across the street? Jimmy Pesto's? Heard that place was pretty good. Get six pizzas over there quick. No. That could've been huge for us. I hope this standoff ends pizza-fully. Pepper-ono-he-didn't! Ugh, you believe this? Pesto is getting the free advertising we were supposed to get. How does, uh one get into robot driving? Did you go to robot college?! Come on, give me your keys, Seth. I'm fine. I only have to drive .37 miles. We're in college, dude. Chillax. Are you sure you guys are naked?! Totally. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

Down in front! Thank you. That was the worst pizza I ever had! Jimmy Pesto's is crap! Yes! Ouch. Yeah. I'm sorry about the pizzas. Um, what do you want instead? Chinese? Burgers. Mexican?

Uh, that you'd be, um, hot. Hot? Like Vin Diesel hot? N-No, like hot-tempered. Like a hot guy with a bad temper So, here's the burgers. Bobby! How did you miss that?! Fatty got in the way. Uh, it's a code name we gave to Bob. You screwed up big-time shooting at me! Maybe I'll shoot a hostage! Go ahead! Do it, big man! Shoot a hostage! You shoot a hostage. Maybe I will! What is going on here?! You guys are trigger happy. No, we're not! Are, too! What is wrong with you people? Stop this! Who is this? It's Bob. It's fatty. Look, Bob, we're gonna get everyone out of there safely, okay? I don't believe you! That was not on my orders. Someone just got a little hot. He's hot. We're cool. Remember? We're cool. We just shoot sometimes. Okay, this is ridiculous. I'm coming outside now. Do not shoot me! Whoa, whoa, whoa. If I let you go now, then everyone will want to leave. And it's a big domino effect thing. Bob's a hostage now. No. W-Wait, no. Hey, man, it's a really great group. Will you close those blinds? Maybe we should pass those burgers around. My blood sugar is low. - I dropped them. - What?! I was getting shot at. Drive through! That was gonna be my red meat for the week. What am I gonna do for protein? I've got a protein bar in my pocket. You can fish it out. I am so glad you joined the group, Bob. Oh, shut up, Frond. You guys know each other? What a coinky-dink. He works at my kids' school. We've had our We hate each other. What? Oh, this is gonna be fun, you guys. He's taken Bob as a hostage. What?! This crazy! Yeah. Crazy good for my essay. Hello? Hello. You're on with Bob's youngest child, Louise. It's your daughter? Oh! They work with me at the restaurant. Adorable. Yeah. Oh, no. You're such a good father. It's more about not paying regular--whatever. You want to talk to your Daddy? No. I want to talk to you. You have been selected as the subject of my important person school essay. Shut up. Oh, don't tell me to shut up! Question one What It's my Daddy! Ah! How did you first get into bank robbing? Pfft. Me and a buddy of mine, we just kind of fell into it. You know, I had a gun, I needed some money. All right, kiddo, we've had our fun now. Hand over the It's my daddy! My daddy's in there! Yeah! Okay! So just a couple more questions. I know you're a busy guy. Give me the phone. Give me that phone back. Give it to me. You are being so rude right now. Ow! Ouch! Serves you right, kid. Listen to me, Mickey. We need to talk. No, no, no. You know what, I don't want to talk to you, I want to talk to the little girl. Negative. You'll talk with me. It's the girl or, you know, I shoot somebody, I kill somebody. All right. Hang on. Hang on. Hi, um Listen, Mickey, you said you were a bank robber. Hey! I'm gonna shoot somebody. Fine, here she is. This is Louise. I'm running the show now. Bobby! I'm worried about you. Who is this? Hey, it's Linda. Linda, hi. Who's this? This is Mickey. I'm a criminal. Hey, Nicky. How old are we? Don't worry about it. Ask about my money. Hey, Mickey, uh, my sister Tina's worried about her bank account. I have $87 in that bank. I heard 200. And I have just withdrawn her money for peace of mind, huh? Nice! I just brokered the release of my sister's money. You haven't brokered jack! All right, here's how we're gonna do this. Thank you! Hey, gimme that. No, no. I need that for evidence. I will punch you. And I will punch you! He will. I'm through playing games, Mickey! Uh, actually, it's Bob. Mickey wants me to handle the calls now. Oh. Bob Yeah. All righisten, can Mickey hear this? No. He's behind the counter, playing ""banker."" Oh, good, good, good. All right, now, listen very carefully. You are now my man on the inside. What? No. No, no. I'm just the guy who brought the burgers over, okay? No. Not anymore, Bob. You're more than a burger guy. Now, listen, whatever you're doing at 6:00 pm, in exactly one hour, hit the deck. Hit the deck? What? Hit the deck. You've never heard that expression before? Yeah. I said ""what""? Were you in the navy? No, I was not in the navy. Were you? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I was. But I don't want to go through my military history right now. ""Hit the deck"" means get down. Well, you don't have to be in the navy to know that expression. Just focus. Spread the word to the other hostages. At 6:00, on the dot, hit the deck. Wait, no. Listen, don't do that. Everything all right, Bob? Yeah, uh, no. Everything's fine, yeah. I just had a cramp. Oh, good. Then get over here and play banker. Come on, get in on this. Yay. You got a 50? Come on, I can break a 50. Um, I got a five. All right. Let's break Bob's five. One, two, three, four, five. We broke your five! Thank you. That was fun. You got five singles now. Olsen Benner here reporting from the hostage standoff, where tensions are high. I understand your husband is one of the hostages inside the bank. Yes. Bobby, if you're listening, we love you, baby. If you make it out of there, I will do anything, anything you want. Except that one thing. Us, too, Bobby. Anything. Most things, Bobby. All right, Mickey, you-you have to give up. You-you have to end this before someone gets hurt. I have a plan, Bob, okay? This is gonna go fine. I can help. I am a self-certified counselor, after all. You want money, okay. The cops want to kill you, sure. You have a gun and might kill us. I am freaking out! What is your plan?! All right, I don't have a plan, okay?! This is the first bank I've ever robbed by myself, without Rodney. Oh, truth comes out. Rodney was the brains and you were the dead weight, I'm guessing. Why the hell would you do a job without Rodney?! You stupid idiot! Mr. Frond, shut up. He's right, I'm so stupid. No. I'm nothing without Rodney. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. Okay. All right, come here, come here. Sit down. Hello? Dad, I need to talk to Mickey. It's an emergency; my report's due on Monday. Louise, please. I'm in a hostage situation. People could die. Ugh, I just want to know what the nuttiest thing he ever stole is? Bob, this is Linda. I don't know if you saw what I said to you on TV What did you say? Anything. That's what I'll do for you if you get out. Everything's on the table, including on the table. Lin, Lin, stop. I have to go. Dad, I just remembered, I have an account there, too, and a safety deposit box. So I have about, I think a thousand, and then I just have, like, a lot of valuables in the safety deposit box. I'm sending the robot. How many extensions do you people have?! Four. All right, I'm hanging up. Mickey, listen, we-we got to start making moves here, okay? What if-- hear me out-- what if you release all the hostages Ah. Yeah. No. You leave the money. Sure. Sure. No. You give yourself up. Why not? Why would I do that? Almost as good as your ""what is past due?"" argument. Look, I want to talk to Rodney. Rodney, phone's for you! Hello? Rodney? Mickey! Hey, what's up? Oh, not much. Uh, I botched a job, man. The cops are everywhere. What do I do? Are there cops on the phone? Yeah, but I'm whispering. Yeah, we can't hear anything. Go ahead. See? Oh, man. Rodney. Who the hell is that? Oh, just a little girl who's writing a paper about me. When you two were working together, what was the first thing you would buy after you stole all that money? You know, I love me a Cadbury egg, but I That's my Rodney. Hey, Mickey, I don't know what you're up to, but count me out. Rodney! Rodney! Rodney! Easy, Mickey, calm down. Ah! Let me out of here! Women and children should be released. You're not a woman, Frond. I will tuck my junk so fast. Look, I'm losing it, Bob. Maybe I should make a break for it. Mickey, look, you're not getting away with the money. You have to accept that. I-I just don't think Rodney would You got to stop thinking about Rodney, all right? You robbed this bank. So you need to decide how this ends, not how Rodney would do it. It's how Mickey would do it. Do the Mickey plan. I don't know what the Mickey plan is though. I just don't want to look like a total failure on TV. Cops touching my hair, laughing at me, pulling on me, grabbing m-m-my new jeans. All right, all right. So give yourself up, but on your r term. Look, I don't make a lot of money selling burgers, - Mm-mm. - but I do it on my terms. Mm, okay. All right, I'll turn myself in. On my terms. And here's one of my terms. I'm hungry! I want one of your burgers, Bob. Baby steps, baby steps, baby steps. That's right, the hostage situation is moving to Fish Rocket Burgers. Say we go to your place, order up some burgers, I give myself up, on my terms. How you like my plan, Bob? Uh, it's not great. Pretty sweet? Uh, I think it's fair at best, Mickey, but it's yours. It sure is mine. Hey, what are you guys doing after this? I mean, not that I can come. Probably not. I mean, maybe I can. Hey, you guys are shoe twins! Look at your shoes. Easy. You're almost home, Bobby! Oh, God, now I have to do that. Bobby, I'll trade you that for two of the other things. Hey, hey, look at that. That's my ride. Gets great ass mileage. How are you still single? I'm not. Oops. Hey! All right, we're out of the restaurant. I just don't get why we have to be in a huddle, too. So you don't fan out. Plus, we're in a huddle, and it just feels like it should be, you know, like a huddle thing. Pretty tight though. Looking good. Hey, I see you! Get in the bank or, you know, I start shooting! Ah! Okay, okay! We're going. See that? Yeah, this is how you go out in style. The Mickey way. Mickey! What advice would you give young people? Who's your hero? What's your favorite pig-out food? Stay in school, Superman, potato chips if I'm sad, chocolate if I'm bad. Louise, get out! You guys are amazing. Best human shields ever. Whoa, look out! Just kidding. Oh, my God, no, look out! I'm kidding. These burgers are good. This is great, huh? Look at me. Burger in one hand, beer in the other-- living life. This is how you go to jail. Yeah, and no one got hurt. Well, that, too. That, too. Hey, Bob, you know when they, uh, caught up to Rodney, they tackled him, and his pants came halfway down. He's splayed out like that, with his hands on his head, ass in the breeze. It's like his pants just kind of gave up. My pants are staying on. So thanks for that, Bob. Thanks for everything. Uh, sure, Mickey. The cops tear-gassed themselves. Love it! Oh, well done. That's the money shot. Goodie. Ow, man, not my Sex-U-V! All right, now's my chance. N-No, Mickey, don't do it. Sorry to eat and run. Was that a cool line? Mm, not really. No! Yes! Run, Mickey! Not the pants! You see that, Bob? My pants are up! Ow! They're up! Yeah, I see, buddy. I see it. Dad! You survived! I did. Oh, Bobby, you're a hero. I don't know about that. You really stepped up today. Maybe I was wrong about you, Bob. Come by the bank tomorrow and we'll see about restructuring your loans. What the? That's a dye pack from the bank. Uh, Mickey must have put it Tsk-tsk-tsk Oh, don't tsk me. I didn't Mm-mm. Oh, come Nope. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Didn't know you had it in you, Dad. I didn't steal the money. I believe you, honey. Kinda. Hey, Bob, why don't you go negotiate the release of some tomatoes from the walk-in? It's been two weeks, Lin. You can stop with the hostage jokes. Bob's Burgers. Bob! It's Mickey! Hey, Mickey, how-how's jail? It's horrible. Ask him if he got the books on tape we sent him. Does anyone there need a pen pal? Ask him what he'll do for a pack of smokes. Hey, Bob, I wanted to know what grade your daughter got on that essay about me? Oh. Um, he wants to know what grade you got on that essay you wrote. Oh. I never even turned it in. Right. Uh, she got an A. Hey, we got an A!"
"2 Feel your uterus curl into a smile as you stretch deeper into Crowning Otter. Ugh, Crowning Otter it's so graphic. Lin, why do you do this prenatal yoga? You're I mean, you're not pregnant. Your youngest child is nine. I like it. It keeps my pelvic floor perky. Ah! - Ugh. - Ugh. Hey, Mom, when you're done polishing your pelvic floor, can you check my math homework for me? There's nothing on here but a drawing of a robot. Who's better at math than a robot? They're made of math. Oh, Mom, did you have a chance to finish reading Buddy's Rainbow? - I did. - The ending was so sad. Ah, this remind me how it ends. Buddy dies, poor doggie. Write it down. Write it down. At least he saw the rainbow. Oh, he did? Yeah. Louise, did you read any of the book yourself? I could read it, but I retain it better when Mom tells it to me. Lin, we've talked about this a thousand times. You can't keep doing the kids' homework for them. I'm not. I'm helping them. What about you, Tina? Is your mother helping you do your homework? No. See? But Mom's been logging her dreams in my dream journal for English class. Great, you're dreaming for her. Oh, last night, I dreamt I was breast-feeding Gene again, and he had a long white beard like Santa Claus. Oh, it was freaky. That could be our next Christmas card. No. Please. No. Well, Teddy, I finally did it. I got a soft serve machine. I knew you could do it, Bob. You just need to believe in yourself. Yeah, and summer's coming. This thing is going to be a gold mine. - Bobby, where'd you go? - Huh? Stop daydreaming. - Let's have some of that ice cream. - Okay, here we go. First bowl of a new era. - Oh, ugh, nasty. - Give it here, give it here, give it here. Don't throw it out. No, no, I wouldn't eat that. Just give it to me. It's not ready yet. Give it to me. Ho-oh-oh. Wow, that is something there. As your first customer, I can tell you, you don't change a thing, you know. Teddy, you'll eat anything. What? I won't eat anything. I'm pretty discerning. - Eat this. - What was that? Don't feed a guy a sponge, Bobby. Don't feed a guy a sponge. You put it in your mouth, Teddy. Louise, guess which one of us ate cat food. Ugh, both of you. We brought it from home. See you in P.E. class. I'm sick of P.E. - So am I. - Me, too. I hate the whole shirts and skins thing. I'm not open! I'm not open! I hate Ms. Schroeder's dumb rules. I told you, Louise, no hats in P.E. And I told you, I have a raging staph infection under here. Touch this hat and we all go down. You want to play dodgeball in the hospital? I hate how I always get hit in the head with the ball. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. I don't want to go to P.E. anymore. Me, neither. Let's swing by Mr. Frond's office. He's highly suggestible. You guys, when I'm in P.E. class, I feel like I'm not living up to society's warped image of fitness. I feel like a loser. I feel like I'm not being valued as a woman. Me, neither. I need guidance and counseling. I'm a guidance counselor. Come in. So you're feeling a little P.O.'d about P.E., huh? But physical education is a state requirement. I can't just let you out of it. But, what if, I don't know, instead of class, we did an independent study in something sort of physical, something, like, I don't know, that the school doesn't offer. Independent study I like the sound of that. Sounds like something I'd come up with. - You just did. Yeah. - You did. - Nailed it. - Uh, I guess I did. The superintendent is going to love this idea. So, what would you do for your independent study? Uh, swimming? No, she doesn't mean - what she says ever. - Or just regular swimming and splashing. I love synchronized swimming. - Who doesn't, huh? - Yeah. I mean, okay, yeah. Great. All right, so, uh you'll need an adult to supervise you. We know an adult. We definitely know an adult. Have 'em sign this. Linda Belcher fancy on the ""B"" definitely signed this form. Tina, synchronized swimming? That is the most random sport in the world. How'd you even come up with that? Mom loves synchronized swimming. Don't you remember during the last Olympics? She made us do everything synchronized. And brush and brush and brush and spit. Good. We just got out of P.E. for the rest of the year, my friends. Yeah, who needs it? Phew. Here, let me try. Huh. I need to exercise. First, you fill the base of the cone. Boring. Just let me do the demonstration, all right? So the ice cream goes on the inside of the cone always? It goes yes. It's like an edible bowl. We get it. Move on. Wait, if that's ice cream, why is it soft? Oh, my God. I have a question. Why are you telling us this? Because I'm going to need your help. You guys are going to be running this thing. Oh. I now pronounce you Team Soft Serve. I made a soft serve this morning, so I should be captain. Kids, time for school. Here, I washed your gym clothes. We don't need gym clothes anymore. Tina, of course we do. What, are we going to run laps naked? Oh, and Gene, here's your Navajo warrior mask for your history class. Wow, Mom, great job. It smells like you. I've been wearing it all morning. I love it. Thanks, Mom. I hope we get a good grade. Hmm, uh-uh-uh. Don't you make noises at me, you judge-a-roo. Go play your judge-eridoo. Uh-uh. Ah-ah! Suckers. Louise, why aren't you in P.E.? Do you guys have lice? I do. I do. For your information, we don't do P.E. anymore. We do independent study, thank you. Yeah, we're off the grid. So long, balls. - Heads up! - Ow. Ow.  Headin' out of P.E.   Gives us time to play on the street   First we lied to Mr. Frond   Now we're in a nail salon   On.  Mr. Frond, pretty yarn. Do you knit? You tell me. What up, my knitta? So, let's talk synchronized swimming. Oh, yeah, I'm always up for that. Big commitment. I bet. I still have the '96 Olympics on VHS. The Miracle on Melted Ice. Ooh, I have Dynasty on VHS. Well, I can't wait to see the routine you choreograph for the kids in independent study. Independent wha?! Those little sneaks. I can't believe they lied to Mr. Frond like that. Ah, here you go, sir. And they used me in their lie. What do you expect? You coddle them too much. Well, I'm not going to coddle them this time. I'm going to get real tough. What a day at school. I feel so physically educated. Hello, kids. I had a very interesting encounter with Mr. Frond today. You did? Yeah, he's an interesting guy. Yeah, he is very interesting, Tina. He's so interesting that he told me about your independent study. Uh I got to go. I have forgot everything outside. Sit down. I got big, big news for you. You're not going to get away with it, either. Dad, do you want some help with the soft serve? Get over here. Look at this face and remember it because it's the face of your new synchronized swimming coach. What? Lin. Huh? I guess we actually have to do synchronized swimming now. Tina, this is the woman who chewed your food for you when you had your tonsils out. We're not going to have to lift a finger. Okay, you two, lift your fingers. starts at your fingertips and ends with your tippy toes. I like it! It holds things in, in all the right places. Why is Gene wearing a girl's suit? 'Cause, otherwise, we wouldn't look synchronized. All right, everyone in the pool. Come on. Whistles are for lifeguards only. - Sorry. - Thank you. Mom I mean, uh, Coach, before we dive in, maybe we could watch you do a few moves. We're visual learners, right, guys? Yeah, like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance. She had to watch a lot of welding before she got good. I love Flashdance. Okay, I see your point. This is called the eggbeater kick. Nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-nang- nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-nang Looking good, Mom! I'm learning a lot from looking! See, not so bad. I could get used to this. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm good not drowning. That could change. Please don't lean on the Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. Be right with you. Here's your ice cream, Teddy. Bob, this is too cold. Can you just put it in the microwave for me? I can't do that right now, Teddy. It's too cold. I can't eat it. Just eat it as is! I can't eat this. - Oh, my God. - Just warm it up for me. Teddy, you're killing me. Come on, take a second. - Give me the ice cream. Give it to me. - Don't put it on too long, now. Excuse me. Can I get a sample of the chocolate? Why do you need a sample? You don't need a sample. But how will I know what it tastes like? It's chocolate it tastes like chocolate tastes. Is it nonfat? Um, no. What percentage of fat is it? I don't know. Is it two percent? I don't know. You should get it melted. Can we get a sample of the melted? You won't be sorry. Teddy. What? Stop. Uh, Bob I think my medium rare burger is turning into a well done situation. - Oh, crap. - Bobby, take it out of the microwave. - Bobby, take it out of the microwave. - I'm cooking now, Teddy. Bobby, take the ice cream out of the microwave. We're back. Lin, you can't keep the kids this late. I need you guys to be here. Here, Teddy, there's your bowl of melted ice cream. Oh, the bowl is hot. I can't do burgers and ice cream by myself. Dad's freaking out. I'm not freaking out! - Totally freaking out. - Shut up! Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh. I'm gonna go change. Me, too. I'm not. How was swim practice, Lin? Good the kids will be ready to get in the water any day now. They haven't gotten in the water yet? They're visual learners, Bob. It's a scam, Linda. They're not playing a sport. They're playing you again. Look, soft serve. Oh, God. All right, here's a sample. I want vanilla. Do you have strawberry? Swirl it. Swirl it. Look, we don't do swirls or sprinkles or strawberry. - Swirl it. - This is not low fat! Oh, my God. Just spit it out. Spit it. Spit it. You're my best friend. You're my best friend. All right. All the teenagers leave! Little Leaguers, too! I ate some of that sponge. - I want a sponge. - Out! Gene, boogers. That is good stuff. Uncut. Kids, down here! Time to work on scissor kicks. Today, we're going to actually do them in the water. Gene just ate, Mom. We could get a cramp. What are you guys doing here? Mr. Frond made us independent study kids, too. Whee! We could use more people for a pyramid lift. Or we could make a circle. Concentric circles. Ooh. Hey, Linda, I like the choreography. You're a great coach a beautiful, sensual coach. Thank you, Tom Selleck. Kids, stop! Stop! Stop! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Marco. Wahlberg. No whistles. You know that. I know the whistle rule! Fine. Please don't lean on the chair. What's wrong with you kids? Don't you care about your independent study? - No. - Louise said this class was a joke. Yeah. Say something funny. Louise, Tina, Gene, get over here now. Ah good one. Cannonball! That is it! Your father was right. You're just taking advantage of me. You and Dad were talking about us behind our backs? Not cool! If you don't care about your P.E. requirement, then I don't, either. I quit! Looks like somebody's ready to coach independent drama. Where are you guys going? The pool's that way. Screw the pool. Without our mom around, we make the rules again. Oh! Am I glad I caught you guys. I have very exciting news. I pulled some strings, left several persuasive voice mails. The superintendent is bringing the school board to the pool this afternoon to watch you synchronized-swim. What?! But our mom quit. Ow. They even suggested doing a graded performance. We're going to set up a judges' table. It'll be like the Olympics. Mr. Frond ha! we should not do this. The whole point of independent study was so that we wouldn't feel judged. You're judged from the day you're born till the day you die. The school board wants to see you do scissor kicks and perfect lifts. Otherwise, you're all going to summer school. Summer school? What am I going to wear? I'm glad you finally quit helping the kids, Lin. - It was the right thing to do. - You were right, Bob. I needed to let my baby birds fly my bratty little baby birds fly - with their crappy little wings. - That was Sometimes you just got to push 'em out the window. - Yeah. - You just got to push 'em right out there. And if they fall flat, then that's them. Well, you know what, it's nice to have you back. It's nice to be back. Hey, you want to train me on this thing or what? You bet I do. All right. Yeah, you put your - Okay. -  put your hand on the knob. - Yeah? Like that? - There you go. Yeah, no. Like that? Slow. Slow. Ah, slow, slow, slow.  Oh  Yeah, there you go. Ah.  My love   My darling  Oh, hey, Tom Selleck. Uh, Linda, take it easy. Oh! Oh! Whoo. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Yeah, you can't pull it down that hard. - Okay. Mom, we're really sorry. Will you come back and help us right now, please? Hmm. Stay strong, Lin. Please. - I accept your apology, and I will help you. - What? Great! Let's go. - I will help you by not helping you. Right? - Mmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What just happened here? Why is everyone smiling and not helping? Mom, Mr. Frond is making us perform for the school board this afternoon. - Not my problem. - Exactly. Not her problem. It's not my problem. - Yes, what she said. - Not mine. Okay, let's not And if we don't pass, we have to go to summer school. - Summer school? - Yeah. What next? Summer church? Summer dentist? Summer visit Grandma? Summer camp? Wait, I'd go there. You guys made your bed, and now you're - going to have to swim in it. - Whoa, whoa. Lin, the kids can't go to summer school. We need them here in the restaurant. I thought you said quitting was the right thing to do. We both said a lot of things. Just, you help them. I will not, you hypocrite. If you want to help the kids you're such a know-it-all parent then help them yourself. I'm done. - Yeah! Dad, help us! - Yeah! Help us, Dad! Please. That's a great idea! No, no, no. What? No, not me. - Yeah. Yes, you. - No, I'm busy. Dad. Hmm? Summer School. And you're here all alone without Team Soft Serve. It's too cold. I can't eat it. What percentage of fat is it? Swirl it. Is it nonfat? - Take it out of the microwave. - Uh, Bob. Swirl it. The bowl is hot. Totally freaking out. - Swirl it. - No! Okay, fine. I guess I'll have to figure out some kind of routine. I taught you kids how to use this, right? Yeah. But I still don't understand where the ice cream goes. All right, shut up. Forget it. Superintendent Douglas, let me get your chair for you. I got it. I got it. Yeah. Ah. Once upon a time, there was no such thing as math. Until one brave teacher said, ""Hey, what about math?"" I think independent study synchronized swimming will be the next math. We are so screwed. We're all gonna die! Let's die like we were born two minutes apart! All right, everybody, calm down. Huddle up. Come here. We can fake our way through this. We'll do a few of these and some of this. And maybe we'll be okay. Dad, go change into your suit. I'm in my suit. Hmm? This is what men wear, Gene, in the pool. Well, it looks ridiculous.   And five, six, seven, eight Fire! Oh, my God. Everyone stay! Phillip, it's a fire alarm. No, we're we're at a swimming pool. This is the safest place to be during a fire. False alarm, people. False alarm! Everything is fine. Let's get this swim going! And five, six, seven, eight Anthrax! Run for your lives! Aah! Anthrax! Anthrax smells like babies! - Oh, my God. - Aah! Phillip, what is going on here? Come over here. Come here. It's-it's just talcum powder. Carry on. Ugh. Linda, it's Tom Selleck. Tom, what are you doing in my coffee? Want to know what's the sexiest thing about you? My ankles. No. You're a fantastic mother. Oh. Anything else? You always do the right thing. All right, we're done. Go. Get out of my coffee. And five, six, seven, eight Doody! Doody! Oh, come on! Everyone out of the pool. We've got a code brown. Don't go near it. It's disgusting. You did a Caddyshack? - Nice move. - What's a Caddyshack? The movie Caddyshack? Never heard of it. Wait, so you didn't just throw a candy bar in the pool? No. Oh, my God. Yeah. Wow. Looks like a candy bar. Thank you. Mine looks like chicken satay. Sorry, folks, we got to drain it. I think we're done here. Next time, let's stick to the curriculum. No! No. No. We are not done. We will we will still do this. We will do this in the empty pool. You want us to swim in a pool with no water? Are you insane? Summer school.   And five, six, seven, eight. Ow! Sorry, Dad. It's Mom. Lin, what are you doing here? A little cup of coffee told me to come. I don't know what that means, but we're glad to see you. We're dying here. Follow my lead! Crowning Otter! Clench that pelvic floor! Gene, you're good. I've seen her do it a million times. And into Downward Stork. Don't forget to breathe. Here comes the baby. Push and push. Oh, oh, it's crowning. It's crowning. Aah! I had a baby! And lift up the baby. Nurse the baby. And jazz hands. We passed! Yes! Next time we do this, I'm getting an epidural. Well, the school board killed independent study. Another Frond innovation in the crapper. But we passed the performance? I guess, technically, you passed. So no summer school? Yeah. Yeah. No summer school. - Whatever. - Whoo-hoo. Yes. Whoo-hoo. But you do have to go back to P.E. Balls. I got to go knit this out. Nice job with the prenatal yoga, Mom. Sorry we were such jerks. That's why I quit being your coach. But I'll never quit being your mommy. You saved our asses. And toned our Kegels. Let's go home and celebrate with some soft serve! Eh, let's go to I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream for Yogurt. They've got more flavors. I want to go to Chilli Billy's. I think they just serve chili. Ooh, now I'm hungry for chili. Good, 'cause we're getting chili. All right! Are we just going to ignore the fact that Louise pooped in the pool? Ignore it? I named it Jezebel. Aw. My little grand-doody."
"2 That's the song I want to lose it to. Mm-mm-mm! This is exciting, right? A video game, right here in our restaurant. Yeah, I used to be pretty good at this game, too. By which, I mean best in the entire school. Wow. Yeah. We would not have been friends. I think we would have, Louise. I was very cool. I'd be your friend. I don't care if nobody likes you. It's him or us, Tina! Uh, I don't know. Don't make me choose. Yeah, I think this could bring in some real business. Maybe enough that we can finally get that new vent hood. Oh, or we could get sailing lessons. Or we could buy gift cards. They're as good as cash. No. We could buy an island. No. And then a smaller island nearby, for farting. Did somebody say sailing lessons? That's a great idea! You said that. Oh. Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves, all right? Fart island. Sailing lessons. God. Look out! Ketchup bottle. Agh! Ooh! I know, I know, the ketchup's a killer. But I got on the board. B-O-B one. ""BOB1."" Hey, Burgerboss! You play? Ah, a little. Well, why don't you try beating my score? Okay. Go ahead. All right. Yeah, you like how these fingers feel, hmm? Yeah, you do, don't you? Huh? Yeah, I bet you never had someone this good. Aw, you make me feel like a king. Jimmy, my kids are right here. Ooh! Please stop, we're just leasing it. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, your corners are so smooth. Mm-hmm. Ooh, something to hold on to; I like that. You got over Ah! Dad, what was your score again? Never mind, Louise. What was it though? Mm-mm. See you, Bob. Call me next time you find something that you think you're good at. Oh, hey, almost forgot. Mm-mm-mm-mm. Huh. Oh, ha-ha. ""Bob Sux."" That's, uh, that's really funny, Jimmy. Then, you know, when I beat your high score, I'm gonna write, ""Jimmy Pesto is an idiot ""and he doesn't know how to spell 'sucks.' And he's dumb!"" Dad, he's gone. I saw. Okay, enough is enough. He's not gonna taunt me on my own turf, Lin. Okay, you know, I'll just unplug it. Maybe that'll erase the high scores, right? Yeah. Ah, that didn't work. You know what? I'll take care of this myself. All right, well, hurry up. It's the kids' night to do the dishes, so we're gonna have to do them all over again before we go to bed. I'll be right up. This won't take long. Just gotta shake off the rust. - Come on. - Bobby? Uh-huh? Could you take a break from that and help me with the grill? Yeah, yeah, yeah. One second. No, this second, Bobby! You played that thing all night. Are you kidding me with that pickle?! I saw that! Oh, Bobby, is this turning into another one of your peeing races with Jimmy? It's not called a peeing race, Lin. It's called a pissing contest. Well, you know how these things turn out. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm. Eh? How about this?! Nuh-uh! Hmm. I'm telling you, Bobby, you should learn to just ignore Pesto. Hey, kid, back off. I feel your breath on my hip. I did it, Lin! Kids, come look! Did you beat Jimmy? What? No. I broke 100,000. Fantastic! Was it obvious I don't care? Just smile and nod. Well, I'm on my way is my point. What? Again? I can't stop now, Lin. Not until I can erase ""Bob Sux."" What's wrong with your hand? Nothing. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Redrum. Redrum. Uh-oh, Bob. You better go easy. You could have the carpal tunnels. It's just a cramp. I must be dehydrated. Ew. This can't happen now. Maybe I should see a doctor. Good. Otherwise, I might have to stop playing. Ugh! Please tell me they shoot webs. Are we finally getting a falcon? I think they're flattering. Like wrist corsets. The doctor said with these splints and these pain pills, I should be good to go. Oh, he didn't tell you to lay off the game? No! I can tell when you're lying, Bob! Whenever you lie, your eyes get crossed a little. The doctor said the last thing Look, they're crossing. I'll just shut them. Ready? Okay. He said the last thing you want to do is stop playing. You're so full of it. What's gonna happen if you can't use your hands? Yeah, how are we gonna do our hitchhiking across America trip? Who's gonna play harp at my wedding? And how will we become a famous father-son close-up magic team?! Lin? Oops. Overslept. Well, might as well take two. Morning, babe. Sorry I got to bed so late last night. W-Where's the game?! The game is gone! Bob, calm down. I got rid of the game. What?! Why?! Look at, look at me. It's an intervention. You have a problem. Yeah, yeah! I do, Lin! ""Bob Sux"" is on the game! And I need to get it off! I'm gonna track down that game, and I'm gonna knock ""Bob Sux"" off the board! Okay, Bobby, okay. I'm not leaving any stone unturned, Lin! They're all gonna be turned! All the stones! Okay. Look at me. Look at me. Happy times. I'm furious! I had the video game company take your game away because I love you. Mm-mm. It's like the time you took away the credit card from me when I was ordering all those porcelain babies.  If you're not real   Then how come I feel this way?   Little babies.  Come here. Come here. Aw, little baby. Linda, listen very carefully. What? Where did they take the game? Miles away by now, Bobby. Just forget about it. Where?! Where did they take it?! You're spitting on me. Wait! Wait! Stop the truck! That's my game! Genie's out of the bottle now. The whole world will know ""Bob Sux."" This isn't over, Jimmy. I'm gonna find that game. And when I do, I'm gonna wipe that smirk off your Damn it. Check Family Funtime. That's where old games go to die. Bleep-bloop-bloop-bloop. That's the sound of a game dying. Ah, there it is. Burgerboss. No adults allowed without kids. Oh, come on, buddy. Why can't you just let me play the game? Hmm, I don't know. Because I'm an adult and, oh, guess what, so are you. Well, I have kids, sir, all right? They're just not with me. So I'm gonna be playing Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna need you to go ahead and step away. Well, I just forgot my keys, so I forgot, I'm a cop! Let me in! I know that trick, too! That's my badge right there! Let me see that badge. No, I know it's not a badge! Well, you better believe I'll be back! Not without children, you won't! There he is. It's nice to have you here for dinner, Bob. Sorry, Lin. Hey, uh, I have to do a thing. With the kids. What? We have a thing? Yeah. But I don't have anything planned until my birthday next year. You're taking the kids out? Yeah. Well, it's, um, it's a secret. For you. Oh! I love secrets. Tell me! Well, this wouldn't be a secret if I told you. Does it have anything to do with jazz? Mm, maybe. Oh! No, no, it's not jazz. It's sailing lessons! You were listening! What? Right, yes. Sailing lessons! Sailing lessons. That's How did you guess? Oh! This is going to be very good for you children. You can join the yacht club. White sweaters around your neck, the gin and tonics, shoes without socks, private fireworks. Kapow! When do the classes start? Um Ba-boom! Tonight, in five minutes. We gotta go. Come on. Anyone else think it's odd our first sailing lesson is at night? No! Probably a lot of class work before they let you out on the boat. All right, we gotta go, come on. Let's go learn how to tie knots. Tying knots! Yay! I'm gonna stow away in a rope bin and fight a rat over a block of cheese. If we see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their mer-ginas are. We're not taking sailing classes, you rubes. Where are you really taking us, Dad? All right, here we are. Whoa. Family Funtime? Now, if that guy asks, you're my kids, okay? We are your kids. I know, but rub it in his face. Excuse me, my kids and I would like to come in. We were made by this guy. Yeah. He had sex, then we happened! Deal with it! I was wrong about you. Thanks! Here. What is this? Oh, that's one token. That's a token. Okay, and then more. All right, have fun. And then more? Have fun. We need more! Can't. Gotta go. We can't play any games with one! Ugh! We could go around and look for interesting throw-ups. There's one. There's one. I've got a better idea. You know what's free? Loading. Freeloading. Let's go crash that kid's party. Oh. Oh! All right, uh, who needs a piece of cake? Who wants a piece? We do! Cake, please! Thanks, that kid's mom. Um, how do you know Kevin again? Soccer. Church. Desert Storm. Nice move. Thanks, kid. Do you mind? You're kind of crowding me. Ketchup, top left, in three, two, one. Whoa. How'd you know? Well, I don't want to crowd you. Are you D-R-L? It's pronounced ""Darryl."" D-Darryl, don't go. I-I need your help. Whoa, what's wrong with your hands? Polio? Carpal tunnel. How old are you? Old. Do you have a job or you live with your mom? Job. What's your job? I have a burger restaurant. Really? Is that so you can get better at the game? It's unrelated. Listen, I need to beat this high score, but I can't get past level 29 and that stupid chicken leg. What the hell does a chicken leg have to do with hamburgers, anyway?! Easy, easy! Ow. Damn it. What's your name, anyway? I'm Bob. Of ""Bob Sux."" Ouch. Who did that? A guy. Jimmy Pesto. I hate him. I got a bully, too. His name's Tyler. Picks on me every day. Oh, that's cool. So, will you help me? Sure, step aside. No, no, no. I gotta do it myself. I don't know, man. Your technique's sloppy and your stance why are you standing way back? You got to press your wiener against the game, like this. See? Yeah. Okay, all right. Wow. Oh. Yeah. Wow. I'll teach you, if you beat up Tyler. How old is Tyler? He's 12. Well, uh, we'll see. Okay. I can't really shake, 'cause my You want to just maybe E.T. it? God, I almost want to beat you up. This isn't a bar mitzvah!  Hava nagila, hava nagila  Ahoy, there, mateys! So what knots did you learn? Knots Landing? Oh, my God. They learned a ton of knots, right? Mmm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh, absolutely. Yeah. A lot. Like what? - Uh the fish noose. - Yeah. - Ohh. - The walrus's surprise. The cake and ice cream. Ooh! That one sounds complicated! When do I get to go sailing with you guys? Oh, uh, soon, Lin, soon. Ooh! I can't wait! I'm gonna start putting my hair up in a ponytail. Why not pigtails, Mom? Twice as classy. I'd go with a flat-top but, hey, it's your head! Time to take my awesome pills. Am I glowing? I feel like I'm glowing, Darryl. Hi, Bob. Oh hey, Burgerboss! Lookin' good. Thanks. Are you high? No. You kidding? A little bit. Yes. Video games and drugs those two things don't mix. Shut up. You're not too zonked to beat up Tyler, are you? No. Who's Tyler? Who's Tyler? Tyler's my bully! He could show up at any time! Come on, Bob, focus! Right, right, right, right. Let me just take one more pill. Happy Birthday, Samantha and Margaret! Our names are Jennifer and Kyrsten! We're always mixing you two up. Hey, Dad, get in on this pizza! No pizza! He's in training. Hope you get your lost manhood back, Dad. Take good care of our father, strange nerd! No funny business. I'm not a nerd! I'm a video game enthusiast.  Close to the top!  See that? Now notice this.  Groping for glory, yeah   I know  Yes.  Sometimes in life   You just gotta say I don't give a damn   Ha-ha!   Groping the night away, yeah   Shoot your arrow in the sky   Tell the gods you'll never die   You're a real special guy   The towel's there, but don't throw it in   If you do, you cannot win   That's how rules work   Crawl up the mountain on hands and knees   It's stained with the blood of your enemies   Groping for glory  I've eaten nine birthday cakes, and I still feel empty. I mean, who are these people? Who are you, who am I? I'm calling it. This party is dead. Okay. Let's go. There's gotta be something bigger we can crash. Glencrest Yacht Club. I'd crash that. I don't know if I can have any more cake. What about crab cake? Hmm, I could make some room. Hi, I'm here for the orphan benefit, Tots Without Yachts? I'm the orphan. I'm Whit Worthington's ward, Wayne. I'm here to change the lightbulb in the lighthouse. Wait. What? We're gonna breeze right past you now. Thank you. Mm-hmm-hmm. Wow. It must be yacht prom. This is the Commodore's Ball. You know what? Just give me the tray. And make some mini pizza bagels. Thank you. This is for you. For your effort. There are more of these tickets where that came from. So keep this guy happy. Ow! Time to reload. This goes in here. And this goes in here. Oh, my God, oh, my God Tyler's here. This is not a drill. Tyler? My bully! W Wait What're you doing? What're Don't. This will make you look tough. And this will make you feel tough. Hey, Darryl, I don't have a lot of shirts, so don't do that. Oh. I thought your arms would look bigger. Let's put these back on. Oh, lookie what time it is. Punch-thirty. Nice one, Ty. Say something tough. Say something like ""punch-thirty,"" then attack them all. Uh, hey, guys, listen, all right? I'm an adult. And it's, uh, it's gonna get kind of heavy here. Hold on, I forgot the bicep band. Okay, punch his face! What the hell, man? I'm not punching any faces, okay? I'm gonna talk to the faces. What are you doing, Bob? Kick his ass! I got it, Darryl. Look, I know you, right? You're Tyler. And you have fun beating up Darryl, here, all right. But Darryl, he doesn't like it. And let's be honest, there's a race thing going on here. Darryl, you're something right? Black? That is not the issue. I beat him up 'cause he's a nerd. All right, I got an idea. Hold on, I'm just gonna take a pill. Mmm. Darryl, I want you to smile. No. That's good. And Tyler, I want you to also smile. - No way. I'm so high. Okay, now, guys, just touch touch your smiles together, okay? This is going really well. So now that we got that Bob? Bob? Bob?! Your bodyguard's asleep, wuss. Ow! That's for standing up for yourself. Chicken leg! Aah! What're you doing? Yeah, Bob! Unleash the beast! No mercy! Ah! Relish hole! Run! This guy's crazy! Fantastic. Not my problem. Thanks for coming to Family Funtime. Drive safe. Chicken leg! Ow! I fell down. Help! There's a crazy man chasing me! Yes! Tomato slice! Take that! What do you think those are for? You get one for every octopus you kill. I'm taking one. Can I have that? I wish I'd met you sooner. I wonder what you looked like 15 minutes ago. Dad! Some hairy guy's trying to kill me! Burgerboss is gonna get you! Oof! Hi, Dad. Bacon-wrapped scallop? Sure. Hello? Hi. Is this Mrs. Belcher? Yeah. I'm calling from Glencrest Yacht Club. Ooh! We need you to come down here right away. Okay! Moisten the mizzenmast! What? You know what I mean! That thing. The mizzenmast! All right!  Three-hour tour  You must be Linda Belcher. Yeah! How'd you know? Your family's in the trophy room. Follow me, please. Trophy room! The mayor is here. Hi, Mayor! I'm glad you made it here so quickly, Mrs. Belcher. We need your help with this. Get away from me! What the hell's going on here? It's the Commodore's Balls. Your husband just barged in here. We caught your children stealing food and regatta pennants. And oyster forks. Princess Mayonnaise! We'll go back to back! Let's fight our way out! All right, someone better tell me what the hell's going on! Is this sailing class? Uh Dad was using us to get into Family Funtime so he could get better at Burgerboss. Now he's in a k-hole. He tried to make me kiss another kid! You deserve it! Who are you people? Who the hell are you? I'm Tyler's father! And the president of this club. Ooh! Oh. Why didn't you tell me this was going on? We were kind of busy, partying our nuts off. Yeah, we were at Family Funtime. Partying our butts off. I said ""nuts""! You know, I'm so disappointed. This whole time, I thought you were taking sailing lessons. Oh, shove it. Judge me. Ah, hello, Linda. You're a member here, Jimmy? Soon. Top of the wait list. I forget, uh, you guys members? All of this is because you went and wrote ""Bob Sux"" on a video game. You. Aw, you're right, Lin. Let me see if I can help out, huh? Bob sucks! Jimmy, you're just as pathetic as Bob with your peeing races. ""Peeing races""? What are ""peeing races""? That's not going to go over well with the membership committee. Sounds like a sex thing. It does. But Aw, come on, guys! Come here, you! We're leaving, you pill-popping liar. Ow. Ow. Come on! Ow. Your mini pizza bagel, sir. I don't even want it anymore. Hold on. Yes, I do. Lin, I'm really sorry I lied to you. And did drugs. And used your children. Use it or lose it, right, Dad? You know what, Bobby? At the end of the day, it's for the best. Can you imagine being on a boat with those people? Yeah. I mean, if we were gonna have to be banned for life from someplace, I'm glad it's there. Yeah, the caviar was too salty. Well, technically, caviar is salty, Gene. Yeah, but I think they salted it on top of that. They're idiots. Oh, hey, Darryl. Hey, Bob. So you're the video game coach? And you must be Bob's wife. She does have big boobies. What?! Yeah, okay. I might have said that when I was high. Well, I came by to thank you. 'Cause of you, I'm not gonna let Tyler bother me anymore. - Really?! - I decided I don't want to be like you, a 60-year-old man, still battling his bully. Okay. Uh, I'm not 60, by the way. But, uh, I'm glad I could help. And you know something, I'm all right with Burgerboss having ""Bob Sux"" on the leaderboard. Aw, I'm proud of you, Bobby. Yeah. Mm. Come here. Hey, you're gonna knock ""Bob Sux"" off the leaderboard, right? I'm on it. Good. Just change it to ""Fat Bob."" ""Dumb Bob"" works too. Or ""Hi, Bob!"""
"2 I got a visual lock on sandwiches. Where? One o'clock. Are they ice cream, or regular? - Both. - Whoa. Keep it in your pants, guys. Psst. Here comes your father. Nice try. I saw you looking. Mom says it's okay to look. Yeah, we're married, not buried! Look, I know you kids are excited about the food trucks that are stealing our business and bankrupting us. I'm excited. What's so great about getting food from a truck? There's no sitting area. There's no bathroom. There's long lines. Who eats like that? Animals eat like that. I don't know, Bob, I think it's nice. It's like camping. Except without all that awful nature. It's just a trend, Lin, and anyway, say good-bye to the trucks, kids. Because tomorrow we are taking back the street. And taking back the night! Respect for women! My body, my rules! Okay, we're gonna block all the spots in front of the restaurant. You ready? Go! Go away! This street's haunted. Bobby, they're everywhere. We're outnumbered. I told you we should've had more children! I'm just gonna let you tire yourself out. Gene, stop. This was a terrible idea. Plan B, Dad! I'm slashing tires! No! Then they'll never leave. I'll poison the tires. Come on, you can't park here! Oh, my God. Randy? It's the documentarian who hates Dad and puts wigs on cows. Werner Herzog? Oh, hello, Bob! I forgot you lived-slash-worked here. Well, I do. And you're blocking my restaurant with your ridiculous food truck. Ode to Soy? I'm soy excited that you like it. I don't. What are you doing here? Are you making another documentary? No. Filmmaking was just a hobbytunity for me. And now you own a food truck? How can you afford this? Hmm I have my ways, Bob. One of those ways is that I have inheritance from my grandfather. You'll be able to read all about my food trucking journey in my blook. What's a ""blook""? A blonde cook. Blooks have more fun. No. It's a blog I'm writing that I'm turning into a book. And then probably a bloovie. You-you can't take two words and make them into one stupider word, Randy. Well, Bob, now you're not invited to the blemiere. Aww. Well, good luck with your terrible vegan food. Oh, thanks, Bob. Good luck with your terrible life. Good luck with your stupid walk. I hate the way you walk. Oh, good luck with wearing that face all over the world. Good luck with your ble your blemishy face. My what? B B B-wha? Good luck with your speech therapy. See, this is what I mean idiots in trucks selling food to idiots on the sidewalk. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I want it! Oh, Genghis Flan! I think I saw pizza straws! Oooh, Ain't Muffin To It! Yay! Se Bob? Look around food trucks are the future. No, they're a trend. Yes, the trend of the future. Well, maybe I'll just get my own food truck, Randy, - and park it right out front here. - You should! Maybe I will! You seriously should! It's a good idea! Then if it's a good idea, I'm going to do it! Well, I hope that you do, because it is a good idea! Well, do you seriously think it's a good idea?! Yes, I do! That's what I'm trying to tell you! - Well, then, I will do it! - All right, I'm glad you took my advice! - Well, I'm not mad at you anymore! - I'm not mad at you in the first place! 'Cause if you think it's a good idea, I should get a food truck! Bob, I'm just mirroring your energy! Fine. I'm my point is I'm a cook. I could do it. Right? Okay. Yes. I think it's a good idea. Thank you. What happened there? Bob's Burgers. - Lin, I did it. - Did what? - Look out in the street. - I'm fighting back. - I'm looking. - I'm not seeing anything. You're scaring me. Just pull the cord and come to the window. - What? Nothing's there. - Okay, switch to the cordless. - Eh - Never mind. Just come outside. What do you mean, you have to go? You don't have to say ""gotta go,"" I'm on the phone with you. - I said come outside. - What do you mean, ""gotta go""? I'm nerv You're making me nervous. - Just come outside. - Gotta go. Ta-dah! Ahhh. What is it? I bought a food truck. I'm gonna show 'em, Lin! I'm gonna show 'em all! Don't, don't breathe that. I'm sure it's fine. Bobby, you bought a food truck? How can we afford this? We can't. Really. I had to dip into Gene's college fund. Nah, I probably won't be needing it. But what about all that stuff you said about not giving in to trends? We're selling out! Yeah! Gene, we're not selling out. We're gonna steal customers from our own restaurant. We'll never see it coming. This truck needs a makeover. Makeover, ooh! We're gonna turn this whore into a Pretty Woman! Big mistake! Big! I love that part. When she does that. She goes in the store. Bob, you're not gonna close the restaurant, are you? Now that you're a hotshot food truck guy? I'm not a food truck guy, Teddy. Besides, I can't afford to close the restaurant. I'm just stealing my customers back. I You don't have to steal me back. I never buy anything off a truck except stereos and stamps. Love that stamp truck. Bob's one to Bob's two. Tina, use our code names! Oh, sorry. Black Beauty to Music Man and The Godfather. What's your 20? Over. We're in the wheelbarrow with Back-hair and The Jackal. I better be the Jackal. Dad. Grow up. Okay, I got the flat-top all installed here. Couple things to know. I rigged it so the grease'll drain into this trap. You don't open it while you're driving, or you'll coat the road behind you. Cars'll be slipping and sliding all over the place. - Slippity-slide! - It's not a joke. It's very serious. Ah, it sounds funny. Oh, one more thing; This is important. What was it? Oh, yeah, you can't have the truck and the grill going at once. Okay. What'll happen? Could be fine, could be a giant fireball. Hey, does this turn the grill on? Yes, it does, Gene. Gene, no! So, you want me to just start over here, Bob? - Yup. - Same invoice? Why not? Who else doesn't want to go to college? Me! Me! It's weird to look at the restaurant now. I can't believe I used to work there. This must be how the astronauts felt the first time they saw the Earth from space. So small. So fragile. This isn't so bad, right? It's tight quarters, but it's kind of cozy. If by ""cozy,"" you mean it reeks. Yeah, why do your armpits smell like feet? - And his feet smell like chili! - 'Cause I don't wash. But do you season? Get up, Gene. Hi, I'm Tina. May I take your order? Sure, Dina. I'll have a No. My name is, uh Dina. Okay. That's what I said. Tina's on break. Dina's filling in and I'm her. Kids, hold down the fort. I gotta drop a potato in the crockpot. Got it. Back-hair's deucin', over. Copy that. Wait. Where's everybody going? Oh, Bob, you're adorably naive. Food trucks go wherever hungry people are! Like super heroes. Like super heroes! Well, where is that, exactly? I'll never tell! Okay, the flea market and then the baseball game. Look, just just follow me on Chowster. Adieu, Robert, adieu! Chowster? It's a site where we can post where the truck's gonna be every day, so people can follow us. You're gonna move the truck around? Can it even drive? Yes! I think. Downhill. I thought we were just gonna park out in front and steal our own customers. If you drive around, you'll be stealing someone else's. Yeah, well, we're not making enough money stealing from ourselves. Great. While you're in the party truck, I'll hold down the fort. The boring old fort with no wheels. Looks like we're adding ""whine"" to the menu. The road will be the perfect place for Dina. She's restless. Oh. What should we call ourselves? We need a handle online. The Cat Burger-lers. Hmm, we're not an improv group. Beef curtains. Gene. Mm. You said I could say that once a year. Yes, on your birthday. @BobsBurgersFoodTruck is just fine. Yeah, if this was three years ago. Oh, you were serious. Beef curtains!  Meet me on the road   Hauling quite a load   Taking lots of drugs, I don't know what   A pen in a jug   Gettin' rest stop tugs   Might've hit a man, but didn't stop.  Yo-ho! Guys! Guess who closed the restaurant and came on the road? We're gonna be like the Partridge family, but with food. You closed the restaurant? Lin, we need to have both going at the same time. Fine, then you go work there. I don't want to. Good! So make room for Mommy in the fun-bus! Dad, drive. - Hey, hey! - Lin, come on. - Okay, go. - I'm not in! Don't go! - Yes! Go, go, go. - Drive! Where you going? Hey, my foot! I told you this would be fun. Hey! All right. Everybody out. Bedtime. In the house? I hate the house. Now that we're not doing the restaurant, the house feels kind of pointless. What do you want to do, sleep in the truck? - I'll go get the sleeping bags. - Yeah! And my moisturizing gloves! And Tina's body pillow! He has a name! Sorry, Jeffrey. A new name calls for a new look. And a new voice. Tina talks like this. Dina talks like this. Nice-sized line, Bob. You're almost getting the hang of this. Yeah, you know, it's fun. Too bad we're not making any profit. Between the repairs, the gas Hey, Dad  and that, we are still in the red. Oh, well, if you want to actually make money on this, you've got to get on the festival circuit. First one of the season is this weekend. Lolla-pa-foods-a? Isn't it funny how much more I know than you? No. I think it's embarrassing. Anyway Everyone gets drunk and spends lots of money. And this year Tabitha Johansson is headlining the concert. - Tabitha who? - The sexy pianist. She sings that song about oil spills, but you know she's talking about her vagina. Gene. How do you know that? It's not subtle. It really isn't. Plus, the most popular truck gets a cash prize: A thousand bucks. Wow, that sounds great. We could really use a thousand bucks. The festival circuit. Maybe we'll never come home! Why would you? Yeah. We can get truck-schooled! And have truck prom. Hey, you'd be friends with everyone in school! You would. Oh, yeah. All right. Everyone's got their seat belt on. Ooh Ooh! This thing is big and intimidating. I don't know if I should drive it Hey, Jennifer Slow-pez! Get the hell out of the road! My God, Lin. What? What's gotten into you? I don't know. This truck just makes me feel so powerful. I think I'm okay now. Hey, Driving Miss Crazy, pick a lane! Hurry up! Hurry up! Lin, are you okay? You seem a little on edge. I'm hopped up on bennies, Bob. Don't tell the kids. What? Where'd you get those? They hooked me up at the truck stop. - See? - These are non-drowsy antihistamines. Well, whatever they are, they're doing the trick. It's gonna take forever to get inside. No, it won't. No one's using this right-hand lane, I'll tell you that. Uh, Lin, I think this is the sidewalk. Use the crosswalk, you maniac! You're gonna get yourself killed! Okay, you guys are my street team. We need to make some money, and it wouldn't hurt to win ""most popular truck."" Gene, Louise you're gonna pass out samples. I wouldn't mind passing out samples. Dina's ready to mingle. Fine by me! Let the new girl do it. Fine, just be aggressive. Dina only plays offense. Gene, Louise, you write our Chowster updates. Make us sound cool. Okay. Should I just write negative stuff about the other trucks so that people will come to ours? No, You should not do that. Okay, I definitely won't. Free samples. Bob's Burgers. Hey, cool glasses. Thanks. I need them to see. Ha! Is this organic? Sure. Is it grass-fed? Yes. Cruelty-free? Is it bison? That one is. Do these pair well with an IPA? It goes well with all letters. IPA, CSI, PTA, IRS, HMO, OMG. Where are you selling these? Uh, right over there. And that's how Dina plays the game. Oh, yeah, totally. The definition of free-range, you know? Let's start with the dumpling stand. Okay, how was it? Mm, I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers. It tastes like they actually went to the dump to get this dumpling. That's not what I said. Woof! Someone put a leash on this quiche! Let's not get this party tarted! These crepes gave me cramps! Hey, guys, what have you been doing? Lying on Chowster. You? Lying to hipsters. I'm lying to myself. I do not look good in shorts. Wow, this is going great, huh, Lin? Drunk people like hamburgers. It's not science.  Oh, it's hot and wet and slick   And it's making everybody sick   Oil spill!   Oil spill   Oil spill.  Ugh, you were right. It's not subtle. See? Ooh, thank you, everyone. And now I'd like to welcome festival chairman Paul Blinkman to announce the food truck winner. Hello, everybody, it's Paul Blinkman. How we doing out there? What the hell, @BobsBurgersFoodTruck? ""More like Boo-ritos""?! Trying to spread rumors, huh? You ruined my business today. ""Samosas on a Stick will make your butt sick""? - Wait.

What an amazing competition this year, and we have a winner it's a new truck Bob's Burgers! - Hey, Bobby! - Bob's Burgers! We won! Sorry, gotta go. Whoo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Come on. Don't boo. Look, I'm sorry my daughter wrote mean things about you and that we knocked off some of your mirrors. You're the one who knocked off my mirror? Boo! You're not even creative. You just make hamburgers. You're the worst! You're the worst! Oh, yeah? Well, guess what. We won! We schooled you! I liked his burgers. And they're grass-fed, cruelty-free soy-bison. Soy bison?

Okay, maybe just the drunk guy who barfed on his baby. I'm gonna throw a falafel at him! There! Ooh, this crowd has energy! - Uh-o. - Bob, kids, get back in the truck. -  Ener-g-gy!  - I'm just going to, uh go! Energ-g-gy! Oh! Oh, Dina, you are more trouble than you're worth. So long, Dina. Uh, everybody, stop. Let me Wait! Stop! If you want to get to Bob, you're gonna have to go through me first. Let's get both of 'em! Here he is! Bob, Bob, let me in. What? You just turned against me, Randy. Please, Bob. I'm not strong. Fine. Whew, that was close, but we're safe now. There's nothing they can do to us in here. Is everybody okay? I'm okay. Kids? I can't feel my legs. Oh, never mind, it's just gas. Hey, Dad, the truck's upside down. I know, Tina. Okay. These foodies are showing some spine, and I like it! Again! Oh, God, we're gonna die! If I survive you, Bobby, I won't get remarried for two years. I don't want to die a virgin. Me neither. Wait, that gives me an idea. No, no. I never should have given in to this stupid food truck fad. - I miss the restaurant. - Me, too. What is going on out there!? This was just supposed to be a food festival. Holy crap. Burn, you beautiful bench, burn! Burn, you beautiful bench, burn! It's nuts out there. I give 'em an hour till they're eating each other. I hope you're happy with yourselves. Look what your Chowster bullying did! Our bullying got us a thousand-dollar check! What about Tina's lies? It wasn't me, it was Dina. It's not a lie if you lie to vegetarians. You taught us that. I-I did teach you that. - What about your road rage, Mom?! - Yeah! - What about it? - It's not very good. Can we agree that Randy is blameless here? - No. - No. Whoa! Almost blameless? All of this started because of you! You got me on Chowster! You told me to come to this festival! All good advice! Look, if it'll make you feel better, I'll do something you tell me to do. Okay, punch yourself in the face, you idiot. I just was punched in the face by your harsh words! Look, let's just lock the doors, hunker down and wait this out. Mm. Talk to me, Goose. What's going on out there? It's Lolla-pa-snooze-a-la out there. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Jump down, Randy. - I'm scared. - Oh, my God. - I have weak ankles. - Fine, stay up. I thought you were gonna catch me. Catch you? Why would I catch you? Boys, stop fighting! Let's do the plan! Yeah! All right! No! No, no, no! No, no, no! Everyone, get in! Get in! Let's get 'em! Gene, release the grease trap. Release the grease! Yes! See? I knew it was funny! We're doing it! We're losing 'em. - Go, us. - Ooh. Nice grill. May I? Randy, no! What? No! Don't worry, everybody, only 15 miles to go. We almost had it all, didn't we? At least we didn't lose this check. I've got half of it right here! That's $500. That's not how it works, Gene. Yes, it is! You're not a bank. Oh, hey, Bob, I met a really interesting guy at the festival. He's got a holistic glassblowing studio. You want take the intro class with me? Oh, yeah, I do, Randy. Really? No. - Hmm, so you lied. - Yeah, Dad. Blow glass with Randy and some interesting guy. That sounds great. Okay, let's play the quiet game until we get back. Oh-ho-ho, you've done it now; I am great at the quiet game. Okay, so start now. - Okay, I have started. - And here we go. Well, you're already losing 'cause you just said something. I'm pretty sure I'm winning. Obviously. What are you talking about? The whole point of the quiet game is to stop talking. - Let's start over. Round two. - Okay, here we go. You just lost again. - What are you talking about? - Gene? So far, two nothing, me. You just lost. Louise, you want to say something? Ah Did I win?! No, you just lost. Bob?! Oh.  Oh, it's hot and wet and slick   And it's making everybody sick   Oil spill!   It's on the fish, it's on the crabs   Foul so close when you can grab   This oil spill   Oil spill oil spill.   Oil spill"
"2 I'm a human spray bottle! Kids, just 'cause your father's not here, doesn't mean you can spit-shine the tables. Is Dad ever coming back? I don't know if it means anything, but when he kissed me good-bye this morning, he said ""Goodbye Louise! I'll never ever see you again!"" He's just at the dentist, Louise. Dr. Yap is dreamy. When he's looking at my molars, it's like he's looking right into my soul. Well I'm glad you like the dentist, Tina, but your father doesn't feel the same way. Getting him there is like pulling teeth. Get it?! I don't like the OK of you. ""You can trust me, Bob."" Yeah, but what about your friend? He looks really scary. I'm-a cut ya. Dr. Yap will be right with you. Okay. Don't touch the instruments. They're sterile. So, it's okay, we're friends. No, it's not okay. You're not supposed to touch the instruments. I was being serious. Right, right, I'm sorry, yeah. Of course. Those aren't their voices. I know. Guess who's on new meds! Gayle! What a surprise! Look, kids, your Aunt Gayle is here. Oh, my God. You didn't even call. Who does that? Just you. And she brought a suitcase. This is the first stop on my Eat, Pray, Love trip around the world. All right! Aunt Gayle got her groove back sexy. I'll only be here for a few days, on my way to Indonesia. Or maybe just home again and order Indonesian take-out. All right, well, let me take your stuff upstairs. You can stay in Tina's room. We can stay up all night gossiping. What's up with Linda lately? Wait, I brought gifts! I picked them out at a truck stop. For you Tina, a cassette tape. The original motion picture soundtrack to Milk. Cool. And for Louise four-hour energy drink. I saved you the last 45 minutes. Thank you! And finally, for Gene, a jawbreaker. I got candy! No fair! I'll challenge you for it. What kind of challenge? Why don't you guys have a hug-of-war? Done! No, wait, wait! That's not fair! I love you! I love you! We can't use strength in this! Meh. Whoever makes the grossest drink gets the jawbreaker. Tina, you'll be the judge. Okay. Yeah.  Doo-wah, a little bit of butter, a little bit of dirt   Little bit of dirt, whoo  Hey. I need that! Stop it! Give it back! Bob's at the dentist today, so I gotta watch the kids and the restaurant. Well, why don't I take'em and go pick up Bob when he's ready? I've always wanted to drive a car. Oh, thank you! Ah, the new Gayle is happy and helpful I love it. The use of dust from the floor was risky, but it paid off. I almost threw up. Louise wins. Yes! Mmm! Hey, there, Bob. Ready to party? Yeah. Ugh, what a day. What happened? I had a patient in here earlier and I accidentally stuck a needle through his cheek. Just I hate Mondays. Oh Uh, no, wait, wait, wait! Uh, wait, Dr. Yap, what is that? Oh, that? That's Greta. What'd you say, Greta? Huh? You ticklish? You're ticklish? You want me tickle you? You want me tickle you?! You have a really great relationship with your guitar. Ah, no, wait, wait, wait. What's, uh What's that? Oh, that's me at my $30,000 time share. I own it with six other families. Three times out of the year, I can go up there any time I want to. That sounds amaz Wait, wait! What's that? That, my friend, is my latest graduation medallion from The Persuasion Arts. It's the ancient art of picking up women. We follow The Prince of Persuasia's three-step program, and it works! The Prince of Persuasia? Mm-hmm. He's a prophet. And for three payments of $900, he can be your best friend. $900? That's right, Bob. Your negligent flossing habits are funding my one way ticket to Pound Town. Yeah. Well, I Ow! I'll tell you all about it when you get back from Snooze City. Pound Town I don't wanna see Pound Town.  Town of the pound  Hello, Dr. Yap. Hi, Dr. Yap. Oh, hey, Dr. Yap. Funny running into you here. Hello, Belcher children and lady I don't know. I'm Bob's sister-in-law Gayle. Bob never mentioned he had a semi-attractive sister-in-law. Thank you. Bob never mentioned he had a dentist. He's in Room One. Hey, baby. You look funny. Did you bring any honey for these biscuits? Oh! Oh, it's been a long time since my pillows got fluffed. You're stupid. Let's go home. For Christmas, I want to get Dr. Yap a subscription to Highlights. He loves that magazine. I'm gonna get him some laughing gas from my private tank. I'm gonna give him my business, from all this jawbreaking. Mm Come on, baby, give me a smooch. Oh, we shouldn't Your tongue feels so much different than my cat's. I guess we could go around the block one more time. Wait a second, ah Whoo! Aah! Gayle! What are you doing here? I can't believe we did that, Bob. That was a huge mistake. We can't do it again. Although we both want to. What are you talking about? She's my sister, Bob! Linda can never know. Know what? You don't remember? We made love. What?! With our mouths. W-Wait a minute. We kissed? Yes, Bob. In the car. After you fondled my buttocks at the dentist's office. But Linda picked me up from the Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, God All these years, Bob, you could only keep those feelings bottled up for so long. Now you're my boyfriend. Oh, God. Listen, Gayle, I was heavily drugged, okay? Tell no one. Wait, no, no. Gayle? Gayle?! Oh, no What do I tell Linda? Nothing. Mmm Mm! Okay, new challenge! Whoever can listen to Teddy tell that story about his wel's the longest wins the jawbreaker. Okay, I'm game. Hi Teddy. What was that thing you were saying the other day, about your towels? Oh, about how I noticed my two towels were slightly different colors? Fascinating. Uh-huh. Right, and I was thinking, were they the same color when I bought them? Or have I washed one more than the other over the years? Great! That's it, huh? No, go on. There's more. What? Well, what do I do now? Do I wash the other one intensely to get it to match? Do I return them? Do I pretend I never noticed? Can I still use them as guest towels? When am I gonna have guests? I don't know. I don't know! What do I do? You bought some at an estate sale once, didn't you? Oh, no, he didn't! Oh, did I tell you about that? No! You win! I'll wait till Louise gets back. She loves my stories. Lin, we need to talk. Something happened earlier today. I know. You went to the dentist. I'm so proud of my little Bobby Baby Teeth. Linda, I kissed your sister. I was on drugs that the dentist gave me and I-I thought it was you, and now, your sister thinks we're going steady or something. That is wonderful! Y-You're not upset? No, I'm not upset. Gayle is finally feeling happier and healthier, and you want to give her whatever she needs, Bobby. Whatever she needs?! What if, what if she wants to have sex with me? Whatever she needs. Sex?! Gayle's always wanted whatever I had. I let her believe she was ""dating"" my high school boyfriend Carl for three years. Three years?! And after she dated Carl, she had the confidence to go after Vinny. I'totally lost. You're Carl. And, eventually, she'll find herself another Vinny. Now go get cleaned up for dinner. You have to look nice.  I know someone who likes you.  So, Gayle, are you seeing anyone right now? Funny you should ask. I actually just met someone. I feel like a teenager again. Except my breasts are more even now. - Uh - It's like biting into a piece of forbidden fruit unwashed fruit so dirty This isn't happening. I mustn't, I mustn't, but I mustn't not. Linda, hallway, now. She had her toes on my crotch. I can't do this anymore, Lin. No, no, this is working. Now let's go have dessert. Who wants cookie dough ice cream?! Me! Yay! And me!  One way or another   I'm gonna find ya, Bob, I'm gonna getcha, Bob   I'll getcha getcha getcha   One way or another   I'm gonna win ya   I'm gonna getcha getcha getcha getcha   One way or another, I'm gonna see ya   I'm gonna meetcha, Bob, I'll meetcha meetcha   One day, maybe next week, Bob   I'm gonna meetcha, I'm gonna meetcha, I'll meetcha  No!  Your tooth is a king now   It's got a crown on it  That's funny. So, you got any plans this weekend? Well, I have a family, so I don't really make plans. Yeah, I was gonna go up to my time share in the mountains; I invited my new hygienist. But she can't come. And she quit. You guys could go up if you want. You practically paid for half of it. Ah, no. No, thanks. Besides, my wife's sister is in town, so Oh, you mean the amateur brunette mature that picked you up? I'd let that happen. Wait! Yes! You're Vinny! Let's go skiing! Allf us: You, Gayle, everyone! Boom. Yes, boom! What about kids? Can you handle some kids? Hell, yeah. It's biologically proven that children lead to sexual intercourse and vice versa.  Children lead to intercourse.  Hm, I wouldn't phrase it like that. Really? You wouldn't? The jawbreaker may be going up the mountain with you, but it is coming down with me. What was that, Louise? I couldn't hear you with my jawbreaker in my ear. Get it out of there! Rubby-rub, ear, ear. Hey, enough! We're Dr. Yap's guests for the night, so behave, or else. Yeah, don't embarrass me. Let's just act like a normal family on vacation with their sexy dentist. Yeah Oop! Watch your face! Look at that. It's working already. I told you. You make her feel good about herself and she's Dr. Yap's problem. Your work is done. So no more kissing my sister, you. What? Huh? Hmm? Um, that's an expression for peeing in the shower. I'm not gonna pee in the shower anymore. Why? Why doesn't he get to do that? Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Why can't I? And why bring it up now? It goes right down the drain. You know what? Let's all kiss our sister. It seems like you and Dr. Yap are really hitting it off. You planned the perfect cover for us to have a romantic getaway. What? No. No cover. No. You pretend to flirt with Linda, I'll fake-flirt with Dr. Yap and then we can sneak off and hit the slopes my slopes! Let there be light. Welcome to the Yap Trap! You caught me. I'll give you guys a grand tour. Linda, Bob, this is your room. Soundproof walls. So don't hold back. I can yell anything I want; no one can hear me! I love my family! Gene. And here's the kids' room. Mirrors on the ceiling. Hey Dr. Yap, look up. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Okay, see you back in real life. Hi. That's funny. There's only one more bedroom but two people left. Me and Gayle. Yeah, Gayle, this room looks comfy. Why don't we just put your bags in here? No. I think I'd rather stay with you and Linda. Ho-ho, Lady Gayle. Don't you worry. We'll figure it out later. And last, but not least ""Jacooze."" It doesn't get hot, but the bubbles still work. We can make it hot. Hey, who's ready to go skiing? Let's get dressed. Yap, I thought you were hitting it off with Gayle. What happened? She's a fighter, Bob. I like it. And I have The Prince on my side. Hello there, my brothers. I almost didn't see you. I am The Prince of Persuasia! There are three steps to persuading women. Step number one: Trap your princess. Physically corner her in a room and eventually, in your life. Insult your princess. Insult her face, her body, her brain, her car. The lower her self-esteem, the higher your chances, bro. It's been biologically proven. By me. Brag. Not lying, but close. Make up a story about how you single-handedly murdered a wild animal. Your story is going to release a hormone, deep inside her body, called Insatia. It makes women ovulate. For sex. Interesting. Woop. Oops. Oops. Oops. Whoops. Well, Gene and Louise don't want to ski, but you guys, you want to take a lesson? We don't need a lesson. Are you serious? You both know how to ski? Tina and I came up here for the Tom Selleck charity event Ski for Babies. For every jump he went off, they were gonna give $100 to a baby. Yeah, but he was a no-show. All these people standing around with cameras. And babies. All right, fine. I'll skip the lesson and figure it out as I go. Whoo-hoo! Lin! Grab my hand! Whah-ha! Take me with you! Sorry! Missed ya! Aah! Oh, God. Trap him. Oh, Bob. This is our chance. Oh, Gayle. No. We can't. Not here. It's too visible. We should do it in the forest. Right. Or the parking lot. Great. Insult your princess. Your face is fat. No, it's not. It's perfect. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's that?  La, la, la! Livin' it up!  Okay, we each shovel snow into our pants. First person to give up, get hypothermia, or die, loses. Okay. I'm fine. I love it. Yeah, I don't feel anything. This is great. Ahh This feels incredible! Here you go. Thank you very much. All right, I'll leave you two love birds alone. See you at the bottom! Yeah, last time I was out in the wilderness, I had to snap a wolf's neck while holding an orphan. Bob! Wait for me! One time, in P.E., I beat a dog at basketball. Playing hard to get, I see. Playing hard to get, I see. Here we go! I love your ski suit, Dr. Yap. What size are you? I'm a men's petite six. Ooh, big boy. You wanna swap later? Swapsies! Last one down's a chimichanga! Hey, Bob! Let's look for a secluded part of the woods, so we can be alone. No, thanks. I'm good. Uh! Aah! Perfect. I'll just follow your Insatia trail. Ah! Ah! I'm okay. Okay. Who can build a better snowman? Ho-oh! Are you kidding me? I practically majored in snowman building. Nuh-uh-uh. Up there Ooh Bob! I'm gonna catch you! Gayle! This isn't funny! I'm out of control! Me, too! Mine's name is Greglisa, the androgynous snowman! He/She's from Thailand. Mine is a self-portrait of me in the future, when I own a falcon who holds my jawbreaker for me. No! I win! Hey, where's the jawbreaker? Ow! Ow! What the hell? Oh, my God. I broke my tooth. Finally, Bob. We're alone. Gayle, wait, I hurt myself. I'm not wearing anything under my snowsuit. Oh, my God! Except for my long underwear. And my socks. And my other socks. And a maxi pad. Ow! Gayle! This is serious. I need Dr. Yap. We don't need him anymore, Bob. Ow! Hi, Bob. Dr. Yap! Thank God you're here. This one's here. But this one's down here. Gayle! Bobby! Linda. Good. This has gone too far. And I broke my tooth. Tell everybody what's going on here. These two were fooling around, Linda. Oh, Linda, I am so sorry you had to witness our foreplay. I can't believe this! You're a hurtful slut, Bob! I can't take this anymore, Lin. You need to tell Gayle what's going on. Enough's enough. Ow! My tooth! Stop! Lin, please, drop the act! I'm in serious pain here! Good! It looks to me like you're in need of some serious dental work. And a smack! Ow! I don't have any Novocain with me, Bob, so Unfortunately for you  you'll be experiencing some pain. Uh-uh. A little pain might do him some good. Bring him back to his senses. No! I need drugs! Let's tie his tooth to the front door and then order a pizza and tell the guy to let himself in. That's stupid. Let's tie it to a deer, and then tell the deer he's late for a meeting! Gene. We're two princes, Bob. And we're going after the same princess. But only one of us has pliers. Why'd you kiss me? Stop it! No! Noooo! Yes! I have Dad's tooth! Who am I? Who am I? I'm Dad! Ow! My tooth hurts! Ow! I want it! Challenge me for it. Whoever drinks the most Jacuzzi water wins! Sold. Yeah! Dr. Yap, earlier today, I fell for you. But after watching you torture my father, I think we should just be friends. With dental benefits. Okay. Hey, now that Bob's out of the picture, maybe you and I could hop in the ""Jacooze"" for a nice cold dip, hmm? Eh, let me know when Bob wakes up. But I-I did all three steps! Nobody likes me! Aw, people like you. Shh, shh. Little baby. Little baby. You don't worry about Gayle, okay? You're a good guy. A real catch. No! No! Ow What happened? You! Linda wasn't enough, huh? So you had to have Gayle, too? Well, maybe if you dropped the whole persuasion thing, Gayle might actually pay attention to you. Well, Linda pays attention to me. In fact, she said she wanted to get in my snow suit. Didn't you, Linda? What? I did? You did?! Wait a minute! You're in love with Dr. Yap?! Hmm Yes! I am in love with Dr. Yap. You are? Wait, what is going on here? Well, that's too bad, because I'm in love with him. I knew it from the moment we met that this short, weird, musky dentist was the man of my dreams. Makes sense. He's mine! No, he's mine! Who wants me more? Don't be gentle. No! Come on, Dr. Yap. Let's go. See? It all worked out. It all worked out?! You slapped me. I lost a tooth. When I saw her on top of my Bobby, kissing him and touching him oh, I went mental. Well, I'll never kiss your sister again. Next challenge! First person to catch a squirrel wins! I'm the Squirrel Whisperer. But you put me up to this. Yeah, well, I didn't appreciate seeing it with my own eyes. But hey, at least we got to go skiing, right? That was fun. Right? Got one! No fair! It's dead! It's not dead. It's sleeping. Gene wins the tooth. Come on! Yeah! Let's get out of here, squirrel. Dress like her dad. It release a hormone called moan-a-tonin. When you get into an elevator with a woman, press a higher number than her, and then make a big deal about it. Push her in a lake. Be one of the tallest guys in the bar, and brag about how long your butt-crack is. Sing a song that you supposedly heard on the radio, and make fun of her for not knowing it. Use the word ""idiot."" Never make her pancakes. Force her to make you pancakes, in the middle of the night."
"2 Dad, don't forget monkey brains. Yeah, and we need more unicorn testicles. That's where dreams are born. All right, we'll get those, then head back to the restaurant. I just need fresh kale for the burger of the day ""If Looks Could Kale."" Ha! Hey, Reggie, I didn't know you guys shopped here for your restaurants. What happened, Pepe? And why is your face painted like a cat? I lost my restaurant. We're trying to cheer him up. I'm a kitty. I'm a kitty. You didn't read the review? Three weeks after the Moody Foody's hatchet job, Pepe's taco joint is a yoga studio. A hot yoga studio. I bet, when it heats up, it smells like taco meat. Like my underwear. The Moody Foody's on a rampage. He nitpicks every little thing, Bob. He said my bread was stale. Well, it is pretty stale, Reggie. That's 'cause I buy day-old bread! Okay. Okay. I've been mapping the Moody Foody's patterns for months. He follows a precise ethnic sequence in restaurants: Asian, European, Latin, American. Like Larry King with his wives. Man, you guys are obsessed with this critic. You should be, too! According to my calculations, you're next. Um okay, that's fine. For all you know, he's already reviewed you. He's a master of disguise. Yeah, when he reviewed my place, he was dressed like a construction worker. For me, he was an E.R. doctor. Park ranger. But listen, Bob, the guy's got a tell. Before every meal, he wipes his hands with a blue handkerchief. Blue. Watch for that, Bob blue. Here you go $30. What? No, I didn't ask for these. Nobody asks. - You describe it, you buy it. - Oh, look. - He even got the hanky. - Can you draw me - on a horse with a zombie riding behind me? - No. Draw a picture of my dad's mustache really giving it to a caterpillar. No, don't do that. Do it! Do it! Do it! Hold on to these sketches, Bob. They could save your restaurant. Uh, Tran, my restaurant will be fine. After all, Reggie's bread is stale. And, Pepe, your carne asada isn't even beef. Carne asada is beef? And Tran's noodles are So what? I reuse my noodles. If people don't eat them all, I'm supposed to just waste them? It's just, no offense, fellas, but I use fresh ingredients, so, you know, I should be all right if this critic comes. Offense taken. Here's you on a horse with a zombie. Dad, pay the man. No, $50 for that? $50 it's a little girl, a horse and a zombie. Dad, that's so cheap for what you're getting. Look, if the critic comes, it's just - another customer, you know? - I know. Just a customer who can shut us down with one bad review that's all. I know he can destroy us, Lin. I don't need a pep talk. And if I did, this would be a horrible pep talk. It's him, Dad. It's the Moody Foody. Gene, that's Mike the Mailman. You've seen him every day for the past five years. It's the long con. It's him. Tina, that's Gene. Long con. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, thanks, ""Mike."" I cannot hear you. That's got to be the food critic. A Civil War reenactor? Ah, can't stand all that drab gray. No wonder they lost. All right, keep an eye out for the blue handkerchief. Hello? You're really sorry? Okay, I'll I'll come do the battle. For the record, the buttons are authentic. All right, everyone, back to work. We're not going to stand around and wait for a food critic who may or may not ever show up. Dad, Dad, another Civil War reenactor is here. He must be fighting for the North. It's a Hasidic Jew, Gene. You know that. Blue hanky! Blue hanky! Blue hanky? Blue hanky? Yes, blue hanky! That's the Moody Foody! - Blue hanky! - Blue hanky! - Right there blue hanky! - Aah! Hanky panky! - Blue hanky right there! Blue hanky! - Hanky panky! Quick, circumcise Gene. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Circumcise me! Circumcise me! Quick, quick! Okay, the Moody Foody is here in our restaurant. This is happening now. Do you need a diversion? I'll scream. Cockroach! Gene. Let's bribe him. Dad, take out the lettuce and replace it with this $20 bill. That I took out of your wallet. Oh, or tape it to his back. That's not how a bribe works, Tina. Yes, it is! Now, everybody calm down, all right? We just do what we do we give him a delicious meal, we get a positive review, and that's that. Yeah, 'cause if we don't, it's curtains. We're done. Lin, stop pep-talking! - Wha? - Let's just take a deep breath Not like that. Where'd Tina go? She's out taking the critic's order. No, no, no. Time for the charm bomb to explode. Hi there, customer. Is someone hungry? That's why I'm here. Are you ready to order? Uh, yeah. I just need another second. Are you just going to stand there and stare at me? Uh-huh. Oh, God. Louise, go get Tina. Shift's over, sweetheart. Let's talk Palestine. Or my order, we could talk about. Oh, God, Lin, go get Louise. All right, all right, all right. Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. How we  doing today? The food here is so delicious. I'm a customer. Try the pad Thai. Mmm. Okay, everyone, great job. Back in the kitchen. Sorry about all that. Um, I'd like to recommend the burger of the day the ""If Looks Could Kale"" burger. Uh, you get it? - Mm-hmm. - Uh, well, you're not laughing. I don't think you got it. ""If Looks Could Kale."" Yeah, I-I got it. I'll have a cheeseburger. Coming right up. That guy's creeping me out. Okay, it got a little rocky out there, but we righted the ship. I set it up, you knock it down. Right, Dad? Yeah right. Thanks, Tina. Smooth sailing. Just like every day. So, well, what kind of burger did he order? Crap. So, I know we discussed having the burger of the day, but I want to say you didn't want that. Where did we land, uh, in the end? You seriously don't remember? No, I do. Um cheeseburger. Just remembered. I just remembered on my own. - Cheeseburger! - Got it. Uh-oh! Oh, God. Aah! That's just the 3:00 fire. Your burger may take an extra minute. In the meantime, enjoy the show. Gene! Oof. Ugh. ""Overdone and dry."" It's like, uh, ""above and beyond,"" right? It's not bad. What about ""insufferable""? What's that? Maybe that just means he didn't suffer. That's good news. I've seen some murders in my line of work, but what a hit job. Wait, here's something good. ""The best part of the meal was"" ""Continued on page 45."" "" was the napkin I spat my food into. Thank you, little napkin."" Oh. This is my fault. I screwed up the burger. It's my fault. So it's settled. Wait a minute. You screwed up. And you and you. All right, stop the finger-pointing. I'm sorry. I sometimes I forget how horrible you all are at your jobs. You're all horrible! Sorry. I mean, you are horrible, but I shouldn't have said it so loud. All right, okay. That's enough of the papers. But you are! Okay, okay, enough. Stop How bad could everybody be?! Stop the yelling. Who cares about one bad review? Don't be such a baby. Come, come, come. This is one of my vacant spaces. It used to be a burger restaurant. Hi, Bob. Hey, Mr. Fish. How are you? Hi, Mrs. Burger. Good. Uh, Mr. Fischoeder, this is still a burger restaurant. Yeah, let us die slowly in peace, you vulture. Right you are. One bad review won't sink the SS Bob, will it? You're like a benign tumor. With a little bit of hair and teeth. I'm like a tumor with teeth? Sounds cute. Yes, little man. It's a compliment. Let's come back in a week. It should be empty by then. Don't worry, Bobby. People can make up their own minds. You'd be surprised. They don't need some critic. As long as we get Michelin-recommended, we'll be fine. Order up. What? What? Something wrong with the burger? No, uh, it's fine. It's just maybe you missed the mark with this one, is all, you know? What? What do you mean, Teddy? I don't know, Bobby. Just tastes a little overdone and dry or something. Overdone and dry, Teddy? You're just quoting the review. No, I know. It's just, now I have words to put to my tastes. Will you get a mind of your own, Teddy? I mean, seriously with your dead eyes! What? My eyes aren't dead. He's not dead. No, I'm fine. And you, Mort. - What did I what did I do? - Whatever! Lin, this review is going to be the end of us. - People think we're terrible now. - Not terrible. We're not terrible. Bobby, you know that. Look at me. I know that, but it doesn't matter. We have one crappy day, and then everybody reads about it, and now that's what they think forever. Hey, how about this place? Oh, yeah? Well, your haircut's overdone and dry! And you, your pants are overdone and dry! Look at your dumb face! It's overdone and dry! Get back here, people! Where are you going? I want to review you - Yeah! - I'm going to review everyone! You're getting it! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! ""Two thumbs down my throat."" That's just rude. Put it down, Bobby. Just stop. Enough. Attaboy. Good day, sir. Good day, Louise. Actually, you've had better days. That's why we're here. We're the PR firm of Cooper, Molyneux and Juarez. Wait. What happened to Belcher? Recent events have left the name, Belcher, badly tarnished. Tina? Here's Dad's image before the review. Here's Dad's image after the review. Rock bottom. Aw. They made a poster, Bobby. Uh, you guys were there, too remember? destroying our business. Hey, hey, hey. Um, I'm pretty sure I was in Sausalito that day. I'm pretty sure you weren't, Gene! All right, all right, let's stop blaming and start gaming. Our firm specializes in image rehabilitation. This is our Basic Image Cleaner Package. Lunch is included. Our Bad Boy Robot Package comes with a boob job. Lunch not included. Your father doesn't need his image cleaned. He's not a celebrity. Dad's a local celebrity. Like Eyebrow Man. Remember before his eyebrows grew out and he was just Parrot Man? I hate that parrot. Hi, parrot. Nerd alert! What? No one knows about peoples' bad days in other professions. None of these jobs get reviewed by critics. I.T. support? That doesn't get reviewed. Sales analyst, not reviewed. Stop torturing yourself. You know what, take off your cranky pants and go take a nap, all right? Accounts receivable specialist. What's that? Sounds great. I bet that job never gets reviewed.  Bup-bup-bup-bow, bup-bup-bow   Bup-bup- bup-bow-bup-bup-bow!  I love this song. Sam my man from Uzbekistan! You got the Bob in the house! A lot of e-mails. Mostly spam. What is that, ramen? Tea. Oh. I thought it was ramen. No. Tea. Hey, what are we talking about? I thought Kathy was making ramen. For some reason, I saw noodles. Nope, just tea. Huh. Hey, it's Jason's birthday. Did you sign the card? Not yet. Oh, here. To the J-man. It's good cake. My wife made it. My wife! Borat! Hey, do it again! Jeff, get in here! You gotta hear this! My wife! Yes! No!  26, 27, 28, Linda, kids, napkin holder, ice cream machine! Oh, come here! Dirty spot on the counter that I can never get out! Get over here! I love you. What the hell is wrong with you? I had a nightmare, Lin. I worked in an office. I had to sign a birthday card. Don't touch me. You're all sweaty. - I hate signing birthday cards. - You sign ours. Actually, your mother does it for me. Oh. Sorry. Like we read those things. Where's the money? You know, I realized I'm not a cubicle guy. I can't do it. I can't do anything other than this. Yeah, look at you. If this restaurant fails, I'm gonna kill myself. - There he is, that's the spirit. - Yup. - You should ask for a redo. - A what? A redo. One time, to get out of a Spanish test, Kelly Mathis forced herself to throw up. I mean, vomite. Hmm. Then another time, to get out of a math test, she forced herself to get her period. That's how she got a redo. A redo! That's genius! We'll get our period! No, a redo. No, period! I'm gonna walk over to the Moody Foody's house and cook him dinner! Wine him, dine him, That's right, Gene! Thank you, Tina. This time I'm gonna make the Moody Foody a great burger. All right! If you think that's the right move, I trust ya kinda. Chant me out! Redo! Redo! Redo! Redo! Let's go watch this train wreck. - Stalking Dad quietly! - Stalking Dad quietly! Oh, well, well, well, the guy who couldn't remember my order finds my address? How'd you manage that? Well, let's just say some of my fellow disgruntled restauranteurs have been dumpsacking your house. Oh, yes, the flaming bags of poop. But I'm not here to do that, all right? I-I came here to cook you another burger. Oh, well that's so ni I'd rather be dumpsacked. Listen, I know your Bob's Burgers experience was subpar. I just want a redo. Of course you do. Great! Let's get started then. Where's the kitchen? Ah! What is that?! It's a Taser! Ow! That stings! What is that supposed to do? It's supposed to incapacitate you. I'm gonna send in a bad review. I am not shocked. Hey! Oh, oh, I'm calling the police! Don't, don't. Wait! I just want to cook you dinner! I just want you to try my burger, okay? Get off me! Just let me cook you a burger! Ow! Ah! You're biting me! Ah! Get Ow! Stop! Dad, we felt we should be here as your PR fir Oh, yes! This doesn't look like a redo. Tickle fight! Hyah! Listen, kids, taping people to chairs is bad, okay? Never do this. We're just helping him calm down so that he can enjoy this burger. Bye-bye, frown! Now it's a smile! There. Comfy? Good. This is an old classic of mine. It's called the ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fennel"" burger, huh? - God. - Was that a nose laugh, huh? Ow! No! - Oh. I laughed, Dad. - Thanks, Tina. Yeah, me, too! Don't tie us up! Okay, big boy bite. No, nuh-uh, no. Not happening. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-mm. All aboard the burger train! No, I'm not getting on the Open up the tunnel. Choo-ch-ch-ch Mm-mm, mm-mm. Are you expecting someone? Oh, that must be my next kidnapper. Bobby, you in there? Lin? What are you all doing here? Linda told us about the redo. We brought food from our restaurants. I brought no food because that man, he ruined my restaurant. So how's it going? Uh, not great. He won't eat my burger. What? Well that's just rude. Linda, wait, don't - Bobby - you've taken him hostage? No, no. He's in his own home. ""Hostage"" is a little much. It's not that. No, no, ""hostage"" sounds about right. - Shut up! - This is dark, Bob. Real dark. I'll go get the jumper cables out of my car. No, no, no, no, no. This should catch any blood or bodily fluids. No blood, no jumper cables. Yes, jumper cables! The man Tased you, Dad! I just want him to eat my burger. You Tased my Bobby and you won't eat his burger? Well, we'll just see about that, won't we? Now all aboard the burger train! Open up the tunnel, li'l baby! I tried that already. Didn't work. Oh. We can make him eat. Oh, goody. Are those the exact noodles I didn't finish three months ago? No, they are the noodles somebody didn't finish yesterday. So, there! Oh, yeah? Well eat this! Mm-mm! Mm-mm! Hey, come on! Come on! Well, if you won't eat our food, then choke on your reviews, huh?! Does this taste like enchilad-ass? Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat your words, all of 'em! - All right! - So, Moody, eat the foody. Guys, stop! Shove it in there, you get it in! Guys! This is crazy. He's not worth it. You're right, no one will miss him. No, Pepe! That's not what I meant. What now?! He tripped the silent alarm. Delivery. I need someone to sign. Help! He's seen too much! No, no, no, no, no, no! All right, this redo is officially out of control. Just now? That's when it's out of control? Uh, breaking and entering, kidnapping. Oh, and now opening other people's mail! It's not what I envisioned. What the hell is this? You bought Tin Cup? That's a terrible movie. You mean ""classic""? I like Tin Cup. But it's a bad movie, right? You ever see it? No, I didn't see it. Then how do you know it's bad? I don't know. It's just bad, right? People think it's bad. I think I read a review of it or something. See? You didn't bother to see the Tin Cups because some critic gave it a bad review! Hypocrite! Who knows? Maybe you would have loved Tin Cups. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Tin Cups. No, it's Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Yes. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. This is killing me! Good, 'cause it's all your fault! You're right. You know, you may have taped down my arms, but you have opened my eyes! I'll never give a bad review again! Yay! In fact, I'm gonna go back and change all my bad reviews to glowing ones and add smiley faces. I think he might be joking! Reggie, he is. Enough talk! Do what you're gonna do to these guys! Nobody's doing anything. He did his job. And you know what? I'm gonna go do mine. Come on. Let's go back to our restaurants and cook. Those of you that still have restaurants. Oh, that's messed up. He's talking about me! Bob's got a point. What are we even doing here? I should be back at my restaurant smell-checking the meats. From now on, I will only dumpsack him when I'm in the neighborhood. But you took the fun out of it. Sorry you got mixed up in this. So, uh, what's it gonna take for you to forget about today? $350. $350?! Yeah. Um, all right, fellas, cough it up. Ah! I don't have a I forgot, um - Seriously? - You're not talking about me. I, uh, have, um $48 here. Give me the DVD. You want Tin Cup? Does it have any special features? Yeah, It's got outtakes. But they call them ""Mulligans."" Oh, come on! Before we cut this guy loose, I just want one slap, okay? In the back of the head. You should give him a purple nurple. No, wet willy! What is a wet willy? A Guillermo mojado. Ah. You do it. I have no spit. Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Guillermo. Guillermo. Okay, one wet willy. That's how you make a birdie! You're in the rough, McAvoy. That's okay. I like it rough. Is she still talking about golf? One of the top five Don Johnson movies, Tin Cup. Are you still doing the half-off-your-meal meal-when-you-bring-in- a-bad-review promotion? Yes, the promotion brought to you by PR giant, Cooper Great. Nice to have business back on track. Yeah, but Bobby, I'm still so nervous the cops are gonna show up. Yeah. I wonder if he called the cops. Hmm. Hmm. Mmm. Hello? Mmm! Sir? Oh! Great. Another one of these calls. Get a girlfriend! Well, if the cops come, we need a plan. We can put Dad in a dress and tell them he's our aunt. Yeah, we'll call him ""Aunty Man Hands."" She came into town for Dad's funeral. Oh, plot twist. I'm not gonna wear a dress. Pantsuit? Okay, fine. I'll go get some pantsuits! Fashion show!"
"2 Okay, everyone, I hope you've all chosen your lab partners wisely. I have. You'll notice a mixture in front of you on the Bunsen burner. Buns sen. This mixture is the most powerful love potion known to man. Whatever you do, don't drink it. Jimmy Junior, no! It will make you want to touch each other's butts! Too late. I don't need a love potion to want to do that stuff with you. Chad doesn't have a partner. Maybe he can join you. The more the merrier. Kids! - Time for breakfast! - Damn. What kind of a maniac wakes up an hour early to write erotic fan fiction? Me. Are there any shows or movies left in the world that you haven't perved up? No. That's why I've started writing erotic friend fiction. Using people at school and zombies. Oh! Do the janitor and the vice principal. I think they'd have beautiful children. I did and they don't. Good morning, my little late bird. What's with the vest? It's my Welcome Wagon vest. I'm showing a new girl around school today. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Bob, this is what we're seeing tonight! Ugh. Experience patty cake like never before. Cake. The New York Times says, ""Cake makes everything we've been doing with our hands obsolete."" This week at the Wharf Arts Center. War Farts! Wow. What a must-miss. No kidding. Stop it. We're going. Let's get to Cake Ugh. This is the cafeteria, and there's the Cafeteria Lady. Hi. And that's our American flag Tina, no offense, but this tour is giving me a snore-gasm. Show me something good. Well, there's a typo on the lunch menu. It says ""browie."" Seriously, what do you do for fun around here? I think there's more on the Tina tour than you're showing me. Okay. There is one place I like to go. What is this? The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. So, you just go around looking through random holes? Yes, but not anymore. Now I just look through this one. Those are Jimmy Junior's feet. I can tell by the way he walks. So confident, but still figuring things out. Ha! No, Zeke! Skid marks. That's not funny. They're stripes. Smelly stripes. - Phew, you stink! - Okay, and who is that? Zeke. He's got some hyper in his diaper. I'd like to see what that shin bone's connected to. Tammy, don't. - Someone might see us. - Hey, what's going on in there? Hi, Coach Blevins. I can't believe I got detention. It's no big deal, Tina. Don't have a crap attack. Sucks they give you detention for wrestling in the library. What is this, Nicaragua? Yeah, this school's lame, right, Zeke? That's Jimmy Junior and Zeke. The feet from the locker room. Mm, manimal. Introduce me, okay? Here. Oh. Mmuh, mm Hey Jimmy Junior! Zeke. This is Tammy. She's new at school. - Hey,  What's - Hi, what's up? My loog. You like that, baby? No. Nice loogie, Zeke. Hey, Jimmy Junior, look at this. I'm okay. Tina! Where the hell have you been? Did you fall in something shiny on your lips? - Mm. - Strawberry. - I got detention. - Detention?! Really? I can't believe this! Detention is no big deal, Mom. Don't have a crap attack. What did you just say? A crap attack. Don't have one. Don't you tell me not to have a crap attack! I'll have a crap attack any time I want! Now, go to your room! This is such a snore-gasm. What the hell was that about? What is it? Yeah. A crap attack? I don't know. Do you? Don't look at me. Well, you're the one that wanted to have one. You're the one that sent her to her room for saying it. I don't know what these kids are saying. Don't have a crap attack. Nice, Bob. Nice. I can't believe Tina got detention. She's changing, Bobby. Tina's turning into a teen. You've lost her, Mom. Time to focus on your good daughter. Gene. I'm pretty. You know, maybe you're overreacting, Lin. I mean, you did have a crap attack. Ha! She's supposed to baby-sit tonight while we're at Cake. Can we even trust her now? That's a good point. Maybe we should stay home. What? Please? We're not skipping Cake. Okay, fine. But I'm gonna complain the whole time. Yeah! You're the baddest girl in detention, Tina. - Tell me about it, stud. - I'm a stud. I'm an idiot. I know, Zeke. Don't talk anymore Tammy, spill that. Jimmy Junior, mop that up with your pants. - Okay. - Tina! We're waiting for you! We need to go over some ground rules for tonight, Miss Mouthy. No boys, no parties, no summoning spirits or switching bodies, and no filling the house with soap bubbles. You hear me, Tina? Yes. I wear glasses, not hearing aids, Mom. Ho! Well, I don't wear a hearing aid either, so I didn't hear that. Haw! Well, good night. What are you doing with the emergency cell phone? Texting my friend Tammy. That'll cost a fortune! We have a terrible data plan! Tammy wants to come over. I texted back a smiley face. She texted back some letters I don't understand. I think she's coming over. Oh, my God, is she or isn't she? I can't wait to ha Louise, wake up, Louise! Ugh. Huh? Cute room. I used to have one of these. I cut its mane off. I bet that looked cool. I'm totally going to do that. No, I won't. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. What's wrong with her face? Looks like she needs a flu shot in her eyes. What's this? It's my erotic friend fiction. ""Tina reached towards Jimmy Junior's butt: ""'Your lips say no but your butt says yes.'"" This is hilarious! It's not meant to be hilarious. It's supposed to be erotic. Maybe you don't understand it. Oh, I understand. And I'm into it. But never let Jimmy Junior see this. He'd be weirded out and he'd never talk to you again. Really? Oh, my God, there's a little drawing here of Jimmy Junior's butt. Wha? What just happened? I think Tammy laugh-farted. That really smells, Tammy. What? I didn't fart, you did! Oh. Okay. Come on, if you're gonna be loud, you gotta be proud! Anyway, since you're such a good writer, how about texting Zeke and Jimmy Junior and inviting them over? I need a Zeke peek. I'm not allowed to have boys over. Come on, Tina. Bring your friend fiction to life. Uh Come on, do it, do it. Do it, Do it. Good. Okay, okay. I'll tell them to get their butts over here. Yeah. How do you do an emoticon for butt? Three. Three three Oh, I hope you got a jar to pee in, Gene. We're gonna be in here a long time. I've got Tina's rain boot. Okay. I'll take the other one. Isn't her hair cute? I did it. Do I look just like Tammy? This is Tina talking, not Tammy. Uh, I know who you are. Oh, 'cause I look like Tammy. No, not really. When I'm 14, I'm gonna shave my head bald. You guys want to play truth or dare? Great, good. I dare us all to drink this! Margarita Mix! The heavy stuff! Cool. That's my mom's! I know, I took a little booze cruise through your living room. Does margarita mix have alcohol in it? No. Mom uses it to fill the humming bird feeder. Oh, my God, I totally feel it. Whoo! Come on now, let's kick on some tunes! I want to hear some FM, baby. You're disgusting. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, my God. I can't stop. Come on, girl! Come on! I can't stop! I can't stop! I'm dancing! I'm dancing, baby! My porcelain horse, Horselain! Leg's broke. We gotta shoot it. Sorry, Horselain. Let's shift into after-party mode. Okay, after party is over. Time to go home. Come on, Tina. We were just starting to have fun. I got to go anyway. My dad's girlfriend just had a baby and she's nursin'. I want to go check that stuff out. - I'd check that out with you, Zeke. - I'll walk you out. Come on, Tammy! So lame. Later, square bear. Bye. Tina, Tina, Tina. Or should we say Margaritina? Don't tell Mom and Dad. Okay, but it's gonna cost you. $10,000. Or you do all our chores for a month! Oh, that's better. That's better. rinse all the pee out of these boots. And this one needs plunging! We're back! Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. How was Cake? Eh Loved it! It made me so hungry. Now, I'm craving cake. Who wants to cake with me? Gene? No thanks. Ever. Oh, you changed your hair. Or maybe her hair changed her.  Dum dum dum.  There's nothing sweet in here. Maybe I'll have a drink instead. No! No? What's gotten into you, Little Miss Mommy Can't Drink? You did hit those Sambucas pretty hard during intermission, Lin. Hey! If they didn't want you to pound 'em down, they'd give you more than ten minutes, right? Oh, you are drunk, Mom. No, I'm not. Yeah, 'cause you're yelling. I'm talking normal. Hm. Mommy doesn't get drunk. She just has fun. Crackers, where's the crackers? You're coming to bed with me. Come on. Hey, Tina, since you crapped out last night, I talked Zeke and Jimmy Junior into cutting and going to the mall. Cutting what? Cutting classes. Come on. You owe me. Sorry, Tammy. I don't want to cut. I thought you might be like this. That's my erotic friend fiction! Uh-uh-uh. See, this stays with me. And if you don't stop acting like a prude-a-bega and come to the mall, I'm going to give it to Jimmy Junior! But you said if he ever saw it, he'd never talk to me again. Yeah. It's called a threat. Oh. But I thought we were friends. We are. That's why I'm making you go on a double date with me. Don't be such a boob punch. Okay. But first, let's fix you up. Hello, Glamsterdam. Now we're ready to go to the mall. Bathroom clowns! much better than being in school right now? Yeah. Hell, yeah! I guess. Jimmy Junior, what do you think of Tina's new look? Pretty trash-tastic, huh? Yeah, I mean sort of. Piercing booth! Y'all do nips or scrotes? Tina, let's get our tongues pierced! I-I don't want to pierce my tongue. Yes, you do. No, I really don't. Jimmy Junior, you can read, right? Yeah. Mr. School. Not really. Fine. I'll do it. But I only have three dollars and a coupon for my dad's restaurant. Okay. What can we get for that? I can give you temporary tattoos. Temp tramp stamps! Where's Tina? She should be doing this. I'm so tired of being hurt by her. It's a bunch of grown-ups playing patty-cake. I don't get it, Bob. Then you don't get me, Teddy. You don't get me. Oh, he's been slapping everything since we got back from that show. It's called ""caking,"" Lin. You know. You were there. No, I don't know. No. I fell asleep. Come on. Do it with me. No! My hands still hurt from yesterday. Teddy? How about you? Put up your hands. No, thank you. I just kind of want to cake with somebody! All right. Ow! I don't like it, I don't like it. Stop! Keep your hands up! I don't like it! I don't like this! Keep 'em up! Just stop! Just stop, Bob. I don't like it. Don't lower your hands, Teddy! You're scaring him. Oh He's crying. It's not fun for everyone, Bob. Tina! You're late! You didn't get detention again, did you? No. I'm just late, okay? What is all that goop on your face? And why are you showing so much skin? Is that a dinosaur over your tar pit? Here you go. What? No. Oh, you want us to tell Mom and Dad about your margarita party? And your new tat? Uh no, I'll do it. Oh, okay! And when you're done here, change my litter box. And don't tell Mom and Dad about my litter box. Tina! There you are. I told Zeke and Jimmy Junior that we'd hang out at the park tonight, and you'd bring margaritas. No, Tammy, I can't. Ah! Tina! Can't you tell that Jimmy Junior likes the new you? Yeah, I guess. Then why do you keep fighting it? I wish I didn't have to force you have fun. Sorry. You know what? Let's see what happens when we lose the glasses. They kind of make your face look like math class. Thank you? No, math class is bad. Oh. There we go. That's so much better, right? Yeah. Ah! Oh, no. Ow. Tina? Tina? What the hell is going on? I wasn't sneaking out. Try again! Over here. Woo-hoo! What happened to your glasses? And where were you going with my margarita mix? I was just gonna meet some people at the park. What? Hold on. The emergency phone's buzzing. ""Where are you?"" Who the hell is texting the emergency phone? It's my friend Tammy. What? Can I just text her back? She'll be really mad if I don't. No! You may not text her back, or anyone. Mom! Stop being a boob punch. Boob punch? Your mother's not being a boob punch, Tina. That's it. You're grounded. ""Your three is grass."" I don't get it. Oh. ""Your ass is grass."" It's not funny. I didn't say it was funny. I just said I figured it out. Why weren't you at the park? I looked like an idiot! I'm sorry. I got grounded. You wrecked my chances with Zeke. That's actually good, Tammy. Zeke's really gross. I don't feel that way! Please don't give my journal to Jimmy Junior. Oh, I'm not. Oh, good. Yeah, no, I'm going to read your freak fiction out loud to everyone tomorrow during lunch. No, you can't. It includes material that may not be suitable for all ages. Don't worry. No one's going to hear all the nasty details over the judgmental laughing! You're going down, Tina! Tina, hurry up. You might be grounded, but you still got to go to school, little lady. Mom, I have a fever. It says you're done if you're a pork loin. Meat thermometer? What, are you new here? Well, let's go, little piggy. Off to school! I can't go to school today. Why? Because. Why? Because Tammy stole my erotic friend fiction. She's gonna read it out loud during lunch today. Everyone's gonna laugh at me and think I'm a freak, especially Jimmy Junior. Aw Is that why you've been acting so bad lately? Yeah. She's blackmailing me. Blackmail? No one blackmails our sister but us! Yeah! Messing with Tina is a privilege, not a right. All right, you two, scoot. I need some private time with Tina. Tina Tammy can't embarrass you. The only one who can embarrass you is you. Yeah? And you're a creative, imaginative girl. You just be you, and Tammy can go sit in syrup. Let the bees get her. What about Jimmy Junior? He's into dancing, right? He probably likes the artsy-fartsy girls like you. Maybe you're right, Mom. Yeah, of course I'm right. I've got nothing to be embarrassed about. No, you do not. I'm going to write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. All right! Freaky friend fiction! And I'm gonna read it to the whole school myself. That's the Tina I know! C'mere.  My little baby's back   My teeny Tina.  Yeah, that's right. Put on that pretty, pretty lipstick, Tammy. Then kiss you ass goodbye with it. Yeah! Unless you lived inside of Mom, you can't mess with Tina. We're Belchers, from the womb to the tomb! We need to get that backpack and steal the journal back from her. Hello. Andy, can I take your backpack on a walk? We'll be back in two minutes. My backpack's gonna miss your backpack. We'll get through this. Sorry, gotta frisk you for weapons. Ugh. You got brownie all over me, jerk. She's clean. Ooh, yikes. Try some club soda. Oh, thanks so much. Was I talking to you? I guess you weren't. Ha ha ha ha! Sucker. I got the goods. On to the cafeteria to save Tina! And get me another browie! So Tina's rotten friend Tammy threatened to read Tina's private writing in front of the whole school. But we had a talk, and Tina's feeling better, so What'd you tell her? I told her she's very creative, and not to be embarrassed, no matter what. Well, that's good advice. Yeah. And then Tina had a great idea. She's gonna read her erotic friend fiction out loud to the whole class herself. Tina's gonna read her erotic friend fiction out loud at school? That's a great idea? Huh. When you say it like that, it doesn't sound as good as when I said it with Tina. Right, 'cause she's gonna read erotic friend fiction out loud at school. out loud Loud at school. At school! Oh, my God! What have I done? I'll drive. Attention, everybody. It's time for announcements. The first one is from our new student, Tammy Larson. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to present to you a What the hell? Cool! Mom packed tampons for lunch! Ooh, share! I have an announcement. It's an erotic friend fiction story that I just wrote. I hope you like it, because you're all in it. It's called ""Buttloose."" This is even better. Tina! Tina! We got your journal back from your best friend slash enemy. I don't need it anymore. ""It was lunch time at Wagstaff."" Touching butts had been banned ""by the horrible Headmaster Frond."" What? No no, no, no. ""Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway."" She knew what she had to do. She grabbed Jimmy Junior's butt, ""and changed the world."" Okay, Tina, that was a great story. Now let's pass back the mike. ""Everyone began to touch each other's butts. ""Omar touched Jocelyn's butt. ""Chad the Zombie ""touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi."" It's Katie, and ew. ""Even the horrible Headmaster Frond touched Ms. Jacobson's butt."" What? ""Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great."" All right, come here. Come here, come here. Come here. Come here, come over here. ""And then Tammy came up to Tina ""and said, 'Sorry for everything.' Okay ""Tina said, ""That's okay. Let's go to the movies next week."" Tina!

It I didn't do it. It wasn't my butt. That wasn't me. No! Oh, ow, ow, ow. That one hurt. That wasn't me! I didn't do it. Why are you guys here? I realized maybe reading your friend fiction in front of everyone wasn't the best idea. It turned out okay, I think. No. No. Honey No, I think it did. No. No, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. I think people liked it. Man, that girl really farted, huh? Hey, Tina. Was the Jimmy Junior in your story supposed to be me?

I knew this mask was powerful! So, who wants to touch and/or be touched by a famous person? Can I please have my mask back? No! I explicitly said no backsies, Peter.

Great here, Dad. Why don't you give me a big hug! Love to. That would be great. Oh, bullhonk! Pam warned me about this when she was binge-drinking. She said fame destroys families. And this family's going right in the crapper. So that is why I think you two should quit the show. Tell him to quit. Tell him to quit. Him! Him! Well, I quit! The dirty tricks department is closed! What are you talking about? Nothing. Forget it. Hey, we had some good times, didn't we? Were you helping him? Were you helping him? Jinx. Yeah, I'm out! I'm sick of your dark, twisted games.

She'll put an end to this. No. What? But what about all that stuff you said about fame destroying relationships? That's just something famous people say. Look, we've struck gold here, and I will be damned if I'm gonna let some mama bear come in here and ruin it! So unless you work for the network or the affiliate or the FCC, I can legally pretend that you don't exist. Well, you're not getting rid of this mama bear so easy! Yes, I am. Security. Hey! Oh, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh! Hey, you see those guys over there with the untucked dress shirts? I'll go tuck 'em in. No, no. They hate that. That's the VP and assistant VP of programming. They're talking about a spin-off. A spin-off? Your own show, guys, with me producing. It could be bigger than Get On Up. Well, bigger than Get On Down, which is the midnight rebroadcast of Get On Up. We're gonna be moderately wealthy! I could date someone half my age five-and-a-half-year-old starlet. Yeah, so it would really seal the deal if you guys would, you know, physically attack each other a little bit. Or a lot. Interesting. Sure. Mm-hmm. Makes perfect sense, right? It's a cooking segment, so, yeah. Great! And physical violence on three. I'm not doing it. One, two, three. Physical violence! Physical violence! Have you seen my mom anywhere? Yeah, I threw her out.

Not you! Oh, stop it! Stop it! Oh, Louise, Tina, Boy-Tina, we gotta get in there! Anyone want to help me throw this through the window? You're a bad, bad boy! It stinks in here! Bob, Gene, look at yourselves! You're father and son! You're supposed to love each other, not kill each other. This isn't the Bible! This show has torn my mily apart long enough! It ends now! Kids, cover your ears. FCC, here comes Linda! Dagnabbit, pee popper, nuts to poppa, stinka boob taka, momma kaga, poopa daddy! What was that? I'm cursing on live TV! Uh, those aren't curse words.

I let the whole TV thing go to my head. No, I'm sorry. This thing turned me into a monster! But I'm not a monster! I'm a real boy! Come on, Dad! Solidarity! Oh, God. Gene, you have let yourself go. Bobida-boobida- bop-bop-bop-ba! Ah, okay, well, now, now we stopped rolling. So there's no need for you Ah, what the hell. Boobity-boobity-ba-bida-ba. Ha-ha! I love you, Dad! I love you, too, son! I love you, Pam! And so, facing major fines from the FCC, this long-running talk show may have had its last word. Just a little too titillating. Well, you two may be regular, unfamous schmucks now, but at least this family's back to normal. Amen! You said it! Single and ready to mingle. Yeah. And thanks, Lin, for showing us some perspective. Among other things. Show's over, Teddy. Come on. Sorry, Lin. It's just, ah, you imagine something for so long, and then what you thought was pink is brown, and what you thought was symmetrical is not. It's just unsettling. Teddy, please. Gene, what'd you do with your mask? Did you throw it in a volcano? Nah. I gave it back to Peter Pescadero. I promised him he would pop and lock his way to a better life, and I did not deliver. Another child left behind. Well, it's certainly nice to have the old Gene back. What? I said it's nice to have the old It's nice Okay, I'm done talking to you."
"Oh! Oh Uh! What? No! Lin, you gotta stop reading the police blotter. It just makes you mad. Why would someone steal the sign for Ball Street? Oh. Oh, God, what is this town coming to? It's going to crap. Tell me about it. Somebody threw a snow cone at my windshield today. I thought I hit a rainbow. It was terrifying. Oh, come on. I don't think this town is going to crap. That's my 2:00. The One Eyed Snakes motorcycle club. Their chapter president died gruesomely. I'm doing the service. That explains why you're wearing leather pants. Been waiting forever to bust these out. He looks like Prince. He looks like fat, white Prince. Look, but don't touch, fellas. Oh, no, these are the guys who took over the Steps. I heard they pick on kids. Wait. I'm a kid! Come on. Let's take the long way. I'm not afraid of some high school kids. Watch a-this. Hey, hey. You can't walk here. Oh, my gosh, I can't walk here? Oh, look, it's a miracle! I'm walking! Shut your butts, coconuts. But you said I couldn't, but I'm doing it. But I want your butt to shut. Oh, listen to the hum of my butt. clap, clap shut, clap it shut! See ya later! Have a great life! Oh, already havin' it! That was intense. Those guys? They're just little acne-covered kittens. - Meow, meow, meow! - Meow! Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª This memorial jam has been going on for 21 minutes. I just wonder if I should fade it out. This was Horny Dave's favorite jam. Keep it cranked. Horny Dave's favorite jam? This is my favorite jam. Keep it cranked, Eddie! Oh, God, don't come here, no, no, no, no. Welcome! You serve beer? We do not. What's that? That is beer. Sorry, we do. I lied. Let's drink to Horny Dave. To Horny Dave! What are you talking about? Yeah! Um, the woman who won that drinking contest, she's pregnant, right? Well, they say in moderation. Hey, man, they don't judge your lifestyle, you buttoned-down pencil pusher. What? Sorry, Bobby, this motorcycle thing's contagious. I kinda want to go out and get a bike tonight. Hassle shopkeepers. ""Hey, old man!"" You know? ""You don't know me. I'll break your window and hit ya with a bat."" Sounds like a great idea, Teddy. Ah, maybe not. Probably just watch a hockey game. To Horny Dave! A helluva man! A helluva friend! A helluva lover! Uh, they broke more bottles. Whoa, looks like our restaurant just got a lot edgier. Hope I can still get in. You probably can't. I'll meet you guys after. I like your lid. I like your vest what's left of it. Yep, these colors have been to hell and back. Part of 'em stayed in hell. What are those pretty buttons? Oh, these patches? Well, we got this one for tickling a cop. Cool! What's that one for? For not being associated with the white power movement. And what's that one for? For blowing up a bunch of balloons for kids like you. Just an ordinary day here at Bob's Burgers, right, kids? Nice place. I'm Critter, by the way. Uh, Bob. Yeah, I'm the, uh, chapter president of these fellas. Horny Dave was, till his grisly death. Well, I'm sure you don't want to talk about it, so Yeah, he got into a wreck with a semi, all right. Real fiery. Mm-hmm. By the time they pulled him out, his entire lower half, the horny half, was roasted. That's why Horny Dave's vest here is in tatters. Um, it looks nice. No, it doesn't, Bob. No, it doesn't. This vest is supposed to make me look like the unquestioned leader of this club, but instead I, I just look foolish. Mm. Whoa! Statch! Nasty Slim! Cool it! See? Horny Dave was just a better leader. If we were fighting, he'd come out and he'd say, ""Let's go cook some meth!"" And we would, and we'd forget all our troubles. That sounds nice. Maybe we should cook meth. I wanna forget my troubles. God bless this meth. Kids, go inside. So, uh, that's your old lady, huh? Uh, yeah. She goes by ""Linda."" Or Dragon. Whichever. So is that your old lady? No, Mudflap was Horny Dave's. She's a special woman. She can open a beer with her boobs. Mine can't do that. It's an art. - Whoa! Ha-ha! Oh, my! Mm-hmm. Thank you. Thank you. Now I want them. Is that a requirement for being in the club? Wish it was that easy. Initiation was tough. Mudflap beat the snot out of some poser in Macon, Georgia one fine day in spring. Got her colors that night. It was fall. It was spring. I remember because the azaleas were in bloom. Ooh, azaleas. Oh, the azaleas are beautiful in Macon. Second only to their crank. That sweet Macon crank. Oh. What's crank? Like meth's dirty cousin. Oh, we're gonna cook meth. Oh ha-ha. Okay, time for bed, sweeties. Come on. Can I bring a biker with me to tell me stories? No, you may not. Please? Just one! No. All right, everybody. We drank the place dry. Let's ride! - Come on, lil' sweetheart. - Jump on back. I'm sure they have designated drivers, so This should cover the damage. Sorry there's blood on some of it. Huh. Oh Oh, one last thing. Here. What's this? Means we owe you one. Put it in your window. Nobody will mess with you. Uh, except maybe the Buzzard Kings. They might throw a Molotov cocktail in here. You call me if they do. Uh! No, no. Right in the window. So, we've got this now. Uh-oh, we're crossing paths again. We're crossing paths! Hey, remember when I told you not to come around here? Guess not. I'm not so good with history. Me, neither! I'm pretty good at history, but I have some problems with math. Well, I'm taking a course in the future. You know what happens in the future? We walk right past you. Uh! I just want no little kids around me when I'm decompressing after school. I'm trying to create a relaxed environment, I'm making my friends feel comfortable, and then you come by with all ts attitude! Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self-esteem over a period of years. Mm-hmm. Shut up, four-eyes. Oh. I'm talkin' to four-ears. With four ears, I can ignore you twice as hard. What, what? What, what? You've pushed me to the point of break. I'm confiscating these. Laters! What just friggin' happened?! So, I couldn't help notice someone doesn't have their bunny ears on. Ha-ha! I know, right? It's, uh, been a pretty long time since we've seen you without your Too long! Too long! Okay. Louise, maybe you'd feel better if you told Mom and Dad How happy I am? Mom, up high. Hey! Oh! I'll take one. You got it, bro! Whoo! Whew. Oh. Geez. Do you think I should go talk to her, Bobby? No, you shouldn't! I'm great! Just fantastic! Uh, maybe wait. You're not wearing your ears today. Or are they invisible? Ha-ha-ha! Invisible?! Where do you come up with this stuff? Your mind is so beautiful! Yeah, take it in! Whoa, Louise, not wearing your bunny ears? This is big. Lots of issues to discuss, feelings to process. Oh, yeah, tell me about it, Mr. Frond! I am processing up a storm, but I could really use a processing-partner! Me?! Great idea! Your office? Five minutes? Yeah! I'm out of here. I'm gonna wait for that punk at the Steps and get my ears back. We'll come with you. No. You guys go home and lie to Mom and Dad. Good. I'm a liar, not a fighter. Louise, wait. What? You want us to keep your dinner warm? Yeah. Real warm. Hello, I see you're wearing my ears. Oh, they're off-center a smidge. Let me just Nice try, kid. Fine. We're all young professionals here. I'm Louise, by the way. I- I don't think I got your name. Logan. Logan what's this in my pocket? Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine dollars for the hat. You can't buy me like a cheap sex lady! Too slow, down low. Why don't you go back to plan-school because looks like you need a better one. Why don't you go to plan-school?! Why don't you? Why don't you? No, you, why don't you? Why don't you?! No, why don't you? Why don't you?! What do we do with this card? Take it down? It's creepy. Are you crazy? Remember when you took down that charity jar? You saw how pissed those breast cancer people got. Hey, parentals. Where's Louise? Um Hat shopping? Shopping for hats. Huh, that makes sense. I guess Louise needs to transition from bunny ears to something. Like training wheels. Like when we got a fish for Gene to prove he was responsible enough to get a dog. I was not. That poor fish. So, where are we going? My calendar is wide open. Yeah, well, uh, I'm home now. So, run along, little doggie. No, we're home now. Until I get those ears back, wherever you go, I go. Going to school, Logan? I'll join you. Let's do it. Nope. Logan, Logan, Logan, Logan. What do you do? You go to your locker before you go to class or you go to class? Gotta pee? What's the routine here? You know, I could pee in the boys' room. Well, you think I won't go in there? I'm not giving up, Logan. I will wear you down. I got a prom date because of these ears. My practice S.A.T. scores went up. I'm not giving up, either. Whoo! It stinks in here. Welcome to boys' smell. Logan! I like your bunny ears. Thanks, Shanaya. They're not his ears! Oh, sorry you had to leave so soon! Let the record show that I tried to reason with you, Logan! Now I have to go nuclear! Can I help you? I hope I'm not interrupting dinner, ma'am, but your son he stole something of mine. Logan! You took this girl's bunny ears? I didn't want to tattle, but you left me no choice. Yeah. I took 'em. Return them. Now. I threw 'em away. I told you you'd never get 'em back. Bull, you threw them away. Search my room. Ugh, Logan. Sorry, I'll write you a check. $20? Oh, God, Tom. Not now! Where did you throw them away? Pancho's Tacos. Which one, Logan? It's a chain! The good one. The one on Riverside. Uh, kid, what you're looking for was incinerated. It's gone. Pfft. Burned up. Sorry. No! Revenge. Is this it? No! Are these it? It's pink with ears. Oh, then they're gone. It's a hat. No. Then they're gone. Hey, I remember this hat. It was gonna be my thing. Remember? I could pull this off. Right? Um yeah, of course you can! There she is, my little big girl. Tina and Gene told us you were in the market for an in-between hat, so we dug some out of the closet. Maybe not this one. You probably don't want this one. How thoughtful of you all, but I don't need a hat to complete me. I'm all I need. Just me. That's what I keep telling you. Good night, Linda. Thank you for thinking about me. You're welcome. All I need is that hat! Mine! Look who it is. Surprised you don't have pig ears on, the way you squeal. Ha! Ha! Ha! Question. How's your hearing? Uh, pretty good. Why? Well, then I guess you can hear that. That's the sound of revenge. Uh For taking that which wasn't yours, I have summoned the wrath of the One Eyed Snakes! Hell hath no fury like Kill the bikes for a second! Thank you. Hell hath no fury Did you hear that part? About hell? Yeah, I think so. Good. 'Cause the rest of it is, ""Hell hath no fury like I do, Logan!"" You took my ears and threw them away. And now these guys are going to take your ears and throw them away. What? Oh, boy. I'm going to watch through my fingers. No, I'm not. I'm going to look away. I think we're gonna have to lay low for a little while after this. Oh, God, don't cut my ears off! Ha! Ho! I hate when shirt tags stick out. Here, here, here, here! I never threw them out, okay? I'm so sorry! M- My ears. Please don't cut off my ears! Leave 'em where they are. They they look good in that position. Can I look yet? Nee-ya I'll let you know. My hands smell like onions. It's nice. Don't ever mess with us again, Logan. Now, get the hell outta here! Ah! Yeah! That's how you do it! That's how you do it! No, no, no, no, we just got the place back together. Welcome back, fellas. How are you? Kids? What's going on? Louise, you're wearing your ears again. Yeah, some kids stole 'em and these mamma-jammas got 'em back! Mamma-jammas, what? Your ears were stolen? Yup. I cashed in the card the One Eyed Snakes gave us. Good to see you again, Bob. Nice hat.

You are serving beer to a ton of bikers. Tom, please. This biker bar is the reason our town is going down the tubes. And we will not allow violence against our children to continue. Violence!

All right, all right, everybody just calm down. Ah! Pick that up, apologize and leave. Please. For your own good. I will do no such thing. Shoulda left when you coulda left. Everyone who's got a knife, grab it! It's a fight to the death! Hey, hey, you can't fight these people, Critter. You'll you'll destroy them. When somebody messes with the One Eyed Snake's colors, they gotta pay. My leadership's on the line. I got no choice we gotta hurt these people. Would Horny Dave have his men beat up some white collar parents? Horny Dave is dead. All right, it's goin' on now, here it goes. They're just bluffing. The One Eyed Snakes don't bluff. Neither do the Belcher kids! Except when we do. Yeah! Let's keep shouting stuff! Screw inside voices! Okay, I'm calling the police. No! My running mix! Oh, enough talk. Let's kick Mudflap, are you okay? I'm fine, it was just a contraction. Let's Contraction? You're in labor? Hold that kid in till we're done! I'll try. No, I can't. This baby's coming.

We're trick or treating by ourselves for the first time ever; we need to get some real candy. Follow me. I know where we can go. We're going where the rich people live. Rich people are better at Halloween. And skin care. That's why we're going to Kingshead Island. Ooh. Ooh. Aah, I should have worn more toilet paper. Okay, uh, okay I admit it's a little colder than I thought it would be. Aah, I don't wanna die. I'm not wearing my good underpants and I'd be so embarrassed. Did it just get ten degrees warmer? I think that seagull just winked at me. Hello. Kingshead Island, nice to meet ya. Now, l trick or treat ya. Wow, look how clean it is. I could drink from the puddles. I'm going to. Hey, guys.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, is that all candy? Yeah, we already dropped one bag off at home. Now, we're gonna head down Spencer Street. That's where all the good houses are. Funny coincidence. We were also gonna go down Spencer Street. Well, great. I'm gonna eat like a Queen. Come on, Lin, Teddy went to the bathroom. Now's our chance. Let's sneak out of here. But you look so cute. I wanna spank the cake right out of your face. Uh, no. Come on. Aah! Oh, my God, oh, my God. Somebody stepped on Francis. Oh, my God, oh, my God. She's not breathing. She's not breathing. Live, damn it, live. Teddy, let me try. I have good lungs. Somebody do something. Mike, do something. What do you want me to do? I'm a mailman. Aah, Mike's a mailman! Oh, God. Come on, move those legs, Francis. Move those legs. Oh, I saw it. I saw it move. Move those She's alive. Come on. Oh, no, she's dead. No, she's dead. Somebody stepped on Francis. And then did nothing. Nothing! Teddy, how do you know someone stepped on her? Guinea pigs aren't flat, they don't just look like this in the wild. All right, well, uh, we're gonna go. Uh, Lin, get your stuff. Yup, yup, yup. Great party. Seriously, I hope that, uh, Francis comes is gets better. Oh, no, you don't. What? What? Nobody's leaving. The killer is inside this room. No one leaves until I find him or her. Sorry I'm late. Whoa, who died? Trick or treat. Oh, you kids look great. Here ya go, one for you. Here ya are. Oh, Africa. Hey, is Bill puking in my bidet again? Full bars? Full bars? Full bars! She just gave us full-sized chocolate bars. Does she know? Oh, my God, was it an accident?! What just happened? How does this not topple your economy? Everything I knew to be true just went out the window. The Wagners are on vacation in St. Bart's. You know what, good for them. Those Wagners were looking run-down. Please, take one. What happens when you take two? Aah, it got me. Help! Oh, wait a minute. Nothing happens. I'll take three. Thanks, Wagner family. Have fun at church or whatever St. Bart's is. Ah, it's got my hand. Just kidding. It was funnier when Louise did it. Ma'am, I'm speaking now. I let you speak. Now let me speak. You don't tell me when to call 911. The police aren't coming. Looks like I have to do this investigation myself. Teddy, I really don't think anyone at your party purposely killed Francis. Every man is capable of murder if he's pushed far enough. Mm-hmm. Even you, Bob. You've been stewing in the corner all night. What are you talking about, Teddy? You can get a little testy, Bob. Don't buy him a V-neck T-shirt, whatever you do. He goes berserk. You're not in the clear either, Linda. You couldn't share the spotlight with Francis, could you? You had to stomp her out. Don't accuse me, Teddy. You're the spouse. It's always the spouse. Passion of m-m-murder passion. Teddy, you're going crazy. I mean, you're kind of ruining your own party. Or did Dennis ruin my party? By killing Francis. I didn't kill your freaking rat. Maybe you didn't, Dennis. But I know you get dirty massages. Whoa. And let's not forget about Mike the Mailman. Me? What about me? It's your walk. Your menacing walk. Slamming your feet all over town. Left, right, Kill, kill. It's a limp, Teddy. You know Mike has uneven legs. It's why I wear my special shoes. Don't you mean murder weapons? Yeah, you know what? I actually wanna see everyone's potential murder weapons. Yeah, shoes in the chip bowl, now. Aww, those were good chips. Yeah, they were, Linda! They were good chips! Okay, guys. It's getting pretty late. Better get off the streets, huh? We're pushing it a little. Uh, don't you think? Yeah. What do you mean? We're just getting started. There's a whole other street here full of sugar just waiting to course through our veins. Hell Hunt. What does that mean? Yeah, why did you just whisper ""Hell Hunt?"" You guys don't know about Hell Hunt? You're not from Kingshead Island, are you? America. Every Halloween, after all the parents get drunk, the teenagers come out and they go freaking crazy. They ride around town on their bikes, vandalize stuff, and if any little kids are still out, I heard they, uh I heard they, uh I heard they, uh They, uh Say it. I heard they shave your head. I heard they throw balloons full of pee. Three years ago my brother's friend stayed out too late and he came home covered in syrup without any eyebrows. Yeah, I don't know about all this. That's a lot of different stories. I like syrup. Look, it's not safe. We've got to get indoors. And you guys need to get to the dock. Cool tip, Milo. Come on, guys. Let's go get some more candy. Huh, what was that? Huh? What? Did you hear that? No. Hell Hunt! Hide! Oh, kids, come out and play. Hey, Wade Boggs, do you like eggs? How do you like these eggs?! Ow! I don't like 'em! Please don't cry. Please don't cry. Ah, quick question. Does anyone here know how to get back to the ferry? Oh, ah, hey, Amanda! Hey, Bryce. What's up? Oh, not much. Just, uh, hanging out with my budsies. I remember when I was a sophomore. Hell Hunt's so lame. Yeah. I mean, it's like grow up, right? I guess it's cool you guys are keeping up the tradition, though. Oh, totally. Yeah, Hell Hunt's the best. So are you. What? Um, that's your car that you're driving? That's your car that you drive? This guy is dying out there. He just needs to be himself. Oh, no. He should pretend to be someone else. What the freak was that? What? I- I thought I heard something. I got 20-20 hearing. Anyway, you should cruise by my lacrosse game. No thanks! Bye! Bye. There's one! Geesh! Aah! Goosh! Ow! Let's go. Where are we? I think it's a country club. It's like a huge miniature golf course. The windmills are gonna be enormous. Look. I see a light. Maybe that's the docks! Tennis courts? I don't think those kids are playing tennis. Or they're playing it very wrong. Ah, they all kind of fit. Like she got stomped a couple of times. Can I have my shoes back now? I'm the only one here with uneven legs. Quit milking that leg, Wobbles. Whoa, that's not funny, Teddy. It's okay. It's my last name. Fine, you can have your left one back! Thank you. Maybe we should ask Francis who killed her? Are you mocking me, Gretchen? No. I'm a medium, Teddy. I can talk to dead animals. Mort, your toupee says hi. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Good joke! She's pretending I wear a toupee. So funny. Okay, we're leaving now. Maybe I can still catch up with the kids. But Gretchen's onto something. Lin, she's just drunk. Let's go before she asks us for a ride home. Bobby! Psst. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! What? What is it? You have fur on the back of your costume, Bob. What? And tiny little scratch marks. Oh, God! Oh, God. I ki killed Francis. Psst! Milo?! I'm so glad you guys are here. They're gonna pee-balloon us any minute now. Oh, yeah, we're glad we're here, too. So, uhyeah, you know what? Oh, this just came to mind. How do you get to the ferry? Oh, ah, okay, just follow this road down the hill and turn right at the stop sign. Now help us break out of here! There's kids loose! Let's get 'em! Run! You're in trouble! - Get it?! - Yes! You can't outrun number one! Yes, we can! Three, please. Let's get off this godforsaken island and back to the armpit we call home. I can't wait to be back in my own house, in my own pajamas, in my own Dutch oven. So long, island! Oh, those kids are really getting it. I remember Hell Hunt. Still can't stand the sight of eggs. Won't eat 'em, won't touch 'em. What about a nice egg salad? No more egg talk! Yes, more egg talk! - Aah. - Eggs! Let's go, Gene! Tina, come on! But Milo and Ned are back there, and they need us. Do they, though? Tina, this isn't our fight! Do you really want to stay here and get pee-ballooned? Yeah. I can pee on myself. I don't need any handouts. Listen, this town gave us the best candy we've ever seen. We owe it to them to go back. Great. Now my candy tastes like guilt! Aah! Fine! We'll go back and save Milo and what's-his-face, but I get to slap Gene. That's fair. Aah! I banish you from the land of Latifah! Okay, so all we have to do is sneak up to the tennis courts, take out the guy guarding the gate, fight off four teenagers and free the kids. I zoned out. Say that again. We just need some kind of distraction. I'll be right there. I'm just stopping to get gum and some t-pons. Distraction located. All right, who wants the first pee balloon? You? No. You? No. And send. Hell, yeah. I just got a text from Amanda. ""Pool party at the Wagner house with me and the girls!"" What? That's awesome! Ugh. It's kind of cold to go pool hopping. ""The Wagner's pool is not cold."" That's weird. Okay, let's go! What about Hell Hunt? Are you crazy? These girls are seniors. I heard Amanda's got a belly button ring. Well, I heard she can tie a cherry stem with her butt! I heard she has to special order her bras! This thing is like a remote control. They'll do whatever I say. Tell them to push their butts together. Give them French accents. She says hurry. And that we're really cute when we hurry. Hey, get all your farts out now before we get there. Help! Help! Let us out of here! Help! Queen Latifah, give me strength! Thanks, guys. Oh, oh, thank you. I'm not a big fan of pee, right, Ned? Well, we've got a boat to catch. Hold on. I'm not done with this yet. These teens messed with the wrong kids us. ""Sorry we are late. ""We are getting our boobs ready. ""You boyz go skinny-dipping. C U soon to skinny-dip."" All right, let's pop off our pants. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. - This is awesome! - We're skinny-dipping! It's gonna be even better with girls, I bet! Okay, let's get to the ferry. This candy's not gonna eat itself. We should steal their clothes and throw them in the ocean. Or we could take pictures of them, and then later, we can look at them. That would show them! Fine, I'm gonna get started. Chocolate, caramel, lollipop, hot sauce. Yes! That's it! Let's put hot sauce in their underwear! Does that even do anything? Yeah, if there's one thing a wiener hates, it's hot sauce. I learned that the hard way. Mmm. Taco on the toilet. Why doesn't everybody do this? and still learning every day.  And that's amazing grace.  Who would like to pay tribute to Francis? Mike? Every time I delivered mail to Teddy, Francis greeted me with a friendly  Wee, wee, wee-wee, wee, boop-doop-doop.  Something like that. What do I do? Teddy's gonna kill me for killing Francis. You got to tell him. A guinea pig. What is it? Anyway, I'm Dennis. Thank you guys. That was beautiful. Bob, do you want to say anything? Yes. Uh, Francis was a great animal. She went through her life with such poise I can't do this. Teddy, I killed Francis. What?! I- I didn't even know I did it! I couldn't feel her underneath this stupid fat suit that you made me wear! Oh. Oh. Oh! Oh, God. Damn it. You could have been summer Frankenstein. Summer Frankenstein wasn't good enough for you. I'm really sorry, Teddy. She gave me the best Wait. She was How long do they usually live? I don't know. Three to five years. Uh, she was a 154 in guinea pig years. Uh, you probably shouldn't have painted her black and orange, man. Yeah, she got real dizzy. She kept trying to eat her paw. Wait. Why would you spray-paint your guinea pig, Teddy? For the party, 'cause it went with everything. I know Lin, I know that. But why, Teddy, would you do that? It's pretty stupid. I got caught up in the party. Okay, Bob. We both killed her. Fair enough. Well, now I can get a ferret. Anyway, thanks for coming, everybody. Sorry I called you all murderers. If anyone wants me to burn them a copy of this Spooky Sounds CD, just let me know. They're not coming. I'm getting pruney. Let's get out of here. Chill out with your dills out, man. Don't be lame. I'll call her. What the? Hey! Bye! I should have just taken one! Those full bars are weighing me down! No! Louise? How many pairs of underwear did you hot sauce? Only one of them wore underwear! Huh. Huh. Oh, you are dead! My baby! Come here! Our pee! Ew! And so, the hell hunters become the ones who are being hell-huntered. Well put. Thanks, guys. Mess 'em up! Bye, Milo. Bye, Milo's friend. We'll probably come back next Halloween. No, we won't! Yes! No! Ooh. Gross. Have you guys seen my phone? Geesh! Uh, actually some kid Ow! I'm getting hit with Ugh, forget it. - Bye! - Yes! Yes! Ooh, so close! Ugh! No fair. I lost all my full bars. You can lick my wrappers. Or I can eat your wrappers! Nothing will ever replace my baby, but these full bars are coming pretty close. There's my little cavities! Yeah, how was your first Halloween without me? Pretty boring, I bet. Uh Um Your father killed a guinea pig! He squashed it with Lin! Oh, tell us about that! Was it in self-defense? Did he disrespect your woman? No. I just rolled on to him. Yay! Yay! Oh, yeah! Here's what happened. Mm-hmm. It was a dark and spooky night. I knew it!"
"Gene, what are you doing? Tanning! It's the middle of summer and I look like a British lady. Hey, slow it down, George Hamilton. You want to look like an Oompa Loompa? Gene, if you want a tan, why don't you go out in the burger suit for a while and hand out samples? No way. I don't want burger lines. Package for Bob Belcher. Dad, that's you! Thanks, Gene. A mystery package! What could it be? Huh, the return address is my dad's old restaurant. That's weird. There's a note. It's from those ladies who bought your dad's place. ""Dear Bob, the workmen found this box ""when they were redoing the air vents. ""We were afraid it had vibrators in it. Boy, were we relieved."" If you think about it, any box could have vibrators in it. Oh, my God, it's my toys! Wow, I haven't seen these since I was just a kid. I used to hide it from my dad because he didn't want me to have toys during work hours. Joke's on you, Dad. Someone filled your toy box with trash. What? No. This is my friend Brilly. A scouring pad? A scouring pal. And my World War II fighter plane. And my dog, Mr. Doglavich. That's soap. Yeah, but see? It's sort of shaped like a dog. Mm What is this feeling I'm feeling right now? It's like I'm sad for another person? Is that a thing? Am I going crazy?! Look, times were different when I was growing up. We had to make our own fun. Here, try these. You'll see. Ow. See? Now I get it. If anything, this is too fun. I want to pet the dog! No, Mr. Doglavich! Sorry, Dad. He's dead. You could take him to the soap vet. No, I can't, Tina! We're going to bury him out back. Everybody get your coats. Bob, stop it now. No! It's summer! That's my dog! He's dead! Go take a time-out. I'm gonna write a eulogy. I knew you so briefly, you dead soap dog. Oh! I think I can fix him. There you go, good as new. Who's a good boy? Woof-woof! Fetch, Mr. Doglavich. Get back to work, Bob. Die! Get back to work, Bob. Get back to work, Bobby. Oh, my God. Lin, I just realized something. I had a bad childhood. Yeah, I know. What do you mean you know? Look at you. What do you mean, look at me? Look at how you stand. People who had good childhoods don't stand like that. I thought I remembered having fun working at my dad's place, but I was just working all the time. And snuggling with steel wool. And petting a piece of soap. I guess talking about it helps. Kids, get back to work. Get back to work Oh, my God! Linda! Kids, your mother and I have an announcement. Buh, buh-buh-buh, buh-baa! You're having another baby? At your age?! Sick! I knew I spotted a bump. What?! No, I'm gassy. No, guys. Okay, here it goes. Kids you're fired. Buh, buh-buh-ba! Ex-squeeze me? You're all fired. I deserve this. I've been coasting. This isn't punishment, it's, it's a gift. My dad made me work all the time. And that box of toys Horrible toys. Yes, horrible toys, made me realize that I never had any fun. So, I want you to go out and have the summer and the childhood that I never had. So go out! Go outside! Go be children! But what are we supposed to do? Have a water balloon fight. Play in a vacant lot. Ride bikes. I'm more of an indoor boy. I can't defend myself, I've been declawed. Gene All right, well, I guess we're gonna take off. Arrivedercis. Bye, Mom and Dad. Keep in touch. Don't change. See you in the fall. Tina, you can come home at night. Ah, phew. I'm glad you kids store your bikes in my garage. It's fun for me. Sometimes I pretend I have three kids of my own and these are their bikes. Which kid is your favorite? Jeremy. He needs me the most. The twins have each other. Whoa. Sometimes I come in here just so I can trip over 'em. I'll be, like, ""The kids left their bikes here again."" All right! Summer fun starts now! Oh.  Fun, fun fun-fun  Fun, fun fun-fun  Fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun   Fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun!  Ah! Diapers! So, how would you feel about, um how do I say this? uh, deferred payments? I wouldn't pay you now, but eventually I would, in the future. What I'm gonna ask you isn't totally legal. It's not a sex thing, though, so Okay, I guess I'll keep these resumés on file. Maybe we can get an unpaid intern. Ooh, they could do coffee runs! Lin, we have coffee here. I don't care. No one's ever gotten me coffee! - Everybody on the floor! - This is a stickup! Mickey! Ah, you're out of the slammer. Bob, Linda. bring it in. Aw Hey how's my favorite hostage? I thought you got eight years. You didn't escape, did you? It turned out the prosecutor was on meth for the entire trial! And he drove his car into a peacock sanctuary. Now he's in jail and I'm out! Oh, good for you. I'll get you a beer A beer'd be nice. Hey, where are those whippersnappers of yours, huh? Uh, I fired them. What? No! That sounds harsh. We laid them off to go enjoy themselves. Ah, yeah, sure, breaking windows, lightin' fires, huffin' paint, Um sniffin' glue, blowin' up houses, settin' rats in a bottle and throwin' 'em down a river and No, none of those things. So, what's next for you, Mickey? What're you gonna do? Goin' straight, Bob! Gonna get a job. Find myself a gal. Or I don't know what people do nowadays. Build a-a barn maybe. Um Paint the barn with the gal. Put the gal in the barn and Yeah, maybe. You know, American dream. Gal and a barn. Yeah. Hey, Bobby, psst. What psst? We can both hear you, Lin. What about ickey-May for the ob-jay? I'm pretty sure he can understand you, Lin. What language is that? Oh. Uh wow. Well, Mickey, if you're serious about finding a job, we-we need someone for the summer. Oh. We can't pay you that much, honey. Not even what we're legally supposed to. I'd work for meals and a cot in the basement. Um I guess you could sleep in the basement. Oh, yay! Oh, I love it! We got the team back together again, huh? Oh! The three amagos. Olé! Ugh! Summer is awful. There's too much pressure to enjoy yourself. It's like New Year's Eve for kids. We should probably go by the restaurant. I bet that place is falling apart without us by now. Well, we've sown our wild oats. Things got crazy! Anyways, no need to grovel, Dad. We're back. We all said things we didn't mean. ""You're fired."" You did not mean that. It sounded very insincere as I remember, and I thought, ""No."" Oh, my God, is someone here? Um Uh Hey, baby Bobs! Kids, you remember Mickey. You fired us for a bank robber? Hey! Look, Mickey, we're back now, so you can turn in your apron. Louise, no. You guys are just our kids now, not our employees. Is that all we are to you, Dad? Your children?! Yes, and I want you to go have fun. Never! Stop fighting it and give it a chance! You can't make us leave. Hell no, I won't go! Hell no, I won't go! Uh! why are you guys stronger than me? Pilates! This is for your own good! Fine! We'll ride our bikes. Oh, yeah, we'll ride 'em so far you'll never see us again! Okay, bye, kids. Have fun. Bye, Mom. Guys, I think we're lost. I know. And all this breathing is making me hungry. Blueberry bushes! We're saved! Is this a farm? I thought those were extinct. We can't just eat these berries. They probably belong to someone. If you don't want people to eat your fruit, grow it inside a safe. I don't know how animals do it. Fruit is just bad, and they know it. Hello, children! Farmers! How did those get in there? Don't worry, we've got plenty of berries. Eat as many as you want. Or if you'd rather have sandwiches, we have plenty at the house. And lizards. I'll eat both. and then I woke up nude on horseback in the forest, and there she was, my Beverly. I had wandered away from a community birthing in a barn nearby. She looked like a faerie queene pooping under a tree.  A faerie queene pooping under a tree.  and we're still doing it. Ew Well, we've got an empty nest now, but we still have our farm. Our dad has a restaurant. We used to work there, but he fired us. Oh, now, that's a shame. We always let our kids work here. Beverly, I have a crazy idea.  They could work here  Work here. We couldn't afford to pay you much. Just, say, ten dollars a day. Ten dollars?! I could start saving for my Porsche Cayenne. But Dad doesn't want us to work. Dad doesn't have to know. Are we gonna send him a letter? You gonna call him up? No. You gonna find a phone and call Dad and tell him stuff? No. Seems like Dad told us to just make our way, didn't he? Well, I guess I don't want any gaps in my resumé. That's right. You don't. Good, because we've got a lot you could do. Yes, they could pick the weed s. Great idea, Bev. We have a terrible weed problem. I don't get it! Morning, kids! Can I get you anything? I'll just have your coffee. Give it back. I'll just have a sip. Louise! No time, Louise. We're late. Late for what? Late to for our What would we be late for? It's not like we have jobs or anything. 'Cause we're late for the pier. Yeah, we gotta go to the pier. Yeah, the pier. To do our pier, our rock stuff. What's rock stuff? What do you mean? Oh, droppin' rocks Yeah. in the water. Sounds fun. Yeah. Yeah. I can disorient a fish. Nice. Well, as long as you kids are having fun. Oh, yeah. Ah. Summer rocks are the best rocks. Boy, we should go. Well, drop one for me. I want your nuggets! You two little critters will be our pickers. Now come with me. Gene has tons of experience picking his nose. And my butt. Tina, you'll be our blueberry delivery girl. Just remember, if you get jammed up, you don't know my name and you don't know where this farm is. I don't know where this farm is. Exactly. Ta-da! Wow, Mickey, you handed out the whole tray of samples already? Sure did, Bob. And, ah, you don't mind the burger suit? I love it. I love it. I know who I am in this. I'm the burger. Right. Sorry, it's a little tight. But, yeah. It is. It's incredibly snug. It looks fine. It's good. I'm gonna need your help taking this off, I think. If that's all right? Oh, uh, yeah, sure. I'll, uh, try and pull the No, you see, there's snaps in the crotch that my arms aren't long enough to get down to. If you could just this and that. Yeah, I don't want to touch down there, so Well, I need you to, 'cause that's what I can't reach. If you could root in there real quick and just pop 'em out. Um ugh. Let me just, ah get in there. Yeah, oh, okay, it's hairy, yup. - Ah, there you go. - Thanks, man. Whoa, Mickey. You're not wearing any underwear. Do not wear underwear in prison. Someone could choke you with it. Well, why don't you leave the burger suit on then, huh? All right. Hey, Mickey's a pretty good worker, huh? Yeah. He's the helpful, enthusiastic employee we've never had. I wish he'd wear underwear though. Yeah, hold the pickle, ha-ha! And that's how you pick the weeds! Which ones are the weeds? They all are. Why are the weeds inside? So that they aren't outside, messing up the blueberries. Why don't you just set this whole greenhouse on fire? Be done with it. Oh, we're going to, one dime at a time. I'll sing you a work song.  Well, we work  And we work and we work all day   Work, work, work in America, work   And we workin' in the weeds and American work   And workin' in the weeds and a work, work, work   And worky-work-work, and come on, Gene.   Pick up the pace, come on, buddy, there we go.  Good day. Hello. Howdy. Hi, I have your blueberry delivery. Hey all right, new blueberry girl. How's this batch, pretty kind? Yeah, kind to your body. Because of antioxidants. Hello, Belcher child. Does your father know what you're doing? No, he thinks I'm having summer fun. Good. Let's keep it that way. Let's keep it that way. Ooh, blueberries. I'm ready for a bake-off. Tina? Oh, it's just the refrigerator. Hey, fridge. You sure sounded like Tina a second ago. Wonder what she's doing right now. And I wonder what Gene's doing. Probably farting. What's so funny? The burger of the day, Bob. I just noticed it. The ""Beets Me Burger."" That's brilliant. It works on so many levels. Well, it's not that good. I mean Louise would come up with a better one than that. Like, she would write, like, ""Dia-beets-es Burger, comes with insulin."" Oh that's in poor taste, huh? Sure, but that's what makes it fun That doesn't sound fun. It sounds hurtful. That's a really terrible disease. Well, I know it is My grandmother had that disease. Well, I'm sorry. B.B. King has that disease. Shut up, Mickey. Sorry, but just hush. Ten dollars in my pocket, Gene got bitten by a lizard, we're living the dream, guys. I just wish Mom and Dad worked at the farm with us. Yeah, I miss making fun of Dad's B.O. I'm too scared to make fun of Cooper and Beverly's smell. I think there's something seriously wrong with them. Hey blueberry girl, do you have any extra blueberries on you? No. And don't ever come here again, you hear me? My parents don't know I deliver blueberries, get it? Okay, whatever. No. Do you get it? Don't come here again. Okay, bye. That was a close one. People love fruit! I will never understand it. It's not that good. Bob. Hmm? Mickey's playing his calypso again. Can you say somethin'? You go. Come on, get up. All right.  Is that a parakeet in my hat?   No, no, no  That's not a parakeet in ya hat   Is that an alligator Mickey?  Want to eat the parakeet? Mickey?  The alligator say Mickey?  No, I do not want the parakeet  Hello, Mickey?! Ha-ho-ho, hey, Bob! What's that? Oh, this? Oh, you've never seen this movie? It's great. It's a guy, he wants to be big. Then he gets big, he doesn't want to be big anymore, then he gets small, but the suit's too big. I'm talking about behind the poster, Mickey. Oh, um Are you making a hole in my wall? No, no, no. I was fixing that. Fixing it with a pick? Yes. Mickey? All right, look, Bob. Don't tell anybody, but I'm digging my way to the bank. What? Come on, no. It's the perfect crime. I've got double jeopardy! What do you mean you have double jeopardy? I'm robbing the same bank, Bob. They can't try me for it again. Yes, they can, Mickey. Look, remember how you held me hostage? Of course I do, silly. That's how we met. And there were SWAT teams, and helicopters, and negotiators? Yeah, it was great, right? It wasn't great, Mickey. That's the only time in my whole life I ever want to have SWAT guys pointing guns at my face. Just that one time. Never again. Got it? So, are you cool with me finishing my tunnel? No. You may not tunnel through my basement to a bank. I forbid it! Fine, then, Bob, why don't you fire me? Okay, you're fired. You're firing me?! Look, you can stay tonight, but tomorrow you're gonna have to find another place. Okay. That's cool. I'm taking the pick. No! Oh, Bob. I tell you. Uh-huh. It's gonna be really tough to find a job within 50 feet of the bank that will also let me sleep in the basement. Hmm. Well, I'm sure there's something. Oh, I'm so clumsy. Better clean that up, Mickey. Actually, I fired Mickey. And good news, I'm hiring you all back full time, starting right now. So you can clean it up! Uh sorry, Dad, but we can't do that. Look, I know what I said before about wanting you to have fun, but the thing is, my childhood was terrible because I actually had to work, and my dad never smiled or laughed. Yeah, mine neither. And he had a drinking problem. Oh, been there, man. Open up some fresh wounds here, Bob. All right, Mickey, enough. All right. I spent last night thinking about this, and I'm a pretty good dad. Yeah, Mom's the one with the drinking problem. The problem is I don't have a friggin' drink in my hand! The point is, you guys don't have a hard life, you know? You just goof around. And you should be goofing around here at home, with us. Dad, we've moved on. We got other jobs. What?! We're working girls now! You're a girl? Yes. Nah. Yes. He's not. He's not. No. Tell that to my vagina! You got other jobs? What do you mean, you got other jobs? What about the restaurant? Oh, that's adorable, Dad. You thought that you could snap your fancy dad fingers and we'd come crawling back. You thought if you didn't want us, nobody else would? Well, guess what, Cooper and Beverly wanted us! Who's Cooper and Beverly? Cooper and Beverly? They're farmers. And they smell great, so don't even bother asking. They still have farms? Where do they have farms? Way out in the country where a man can breathe the air. Sorry, Dad. I hope we can still be friends. Wait. Wait. What are they paying you? I'll match it. Ten dollars a day. Never mind. Have a good day. Bye, guys! Hey, is that blueberry delivery girl with the glasses here? You mean Tina? She's not here. Well, I need to return these blueberries. Can you tell her they were mostly stems and seeds? I want a replacement or my 40 bucks back. Okay, I'll let her know. Okay, bye. Bye. That was weird. Wow, 40 bucks? Those are expensive blueberries. They're probably organic. Oh, they smell like a music festival. Huh, you're right. Oh, my God, Lin. Are the kids working on a pot farm? Ooh. Oh, yeah, the old false-bottom blueberry box. I remember these from when I was a kid. We have to go get the kids. But we have no idea where this pot farm is. I may have some idea of exactly where it is. No, wait, go back, go back, go back, go back. Wow, this isn't what I pictured. It's nice. Hey, I've been there, buddy. Remember, they can't cage this. What are you doing on our property? We want our kids. What kids? There are no kids here. Hi, Dad. Oh, hey Hello. Oh, you mean our kids. Your kids? Those are our kids! Come on, guys. Get in the car. Now. Let's go. Mom, Dad, we already explained this. We work here now. Okay? You're acting a little desperado. No, Louise, you no longer work here. Dad, small farms are the backbone of America. Willie Nelson would love this place! Yes, he would, Gene, but not for the reason you're thinking of. Oh, no. No, no. No SWAT teams! No guns! Code red, Mother! Code red! B- Bob, what do I do? I've never been an innocent bystander before. Just get your hands up, Mickey. Eh, like that? What? No. Up. Like this? The you're doing like kitty paws. Up. Up. Higher. Higher? Like that? No, all the way up. Like past my shoulders? Get down! Everybody down! Hey, I know that guy. Hi. Hi. Pedal, Daddy, pedal! Right! Left! Right! Left!  Right, baby, left  Right, left Stop! And, uh, oh, let's take a right. Let's keep it moving.  Right, and turning  And a little more right. Stop, please. Oh, my God.  We got to get out of here before they catch us  Whoa! Now this is summer fun! Oh, hey, how you doing, guys?  Let's head over this way. I'm getting a little dizzy. And that's why I believe blueberries should be decriminalized. Louise, sit down. Okay, that's recess. Uh, be cool out there. Don't Bogart the snacks. And if the po-po rolls up, your first call's to your lawyer, not your mom."
"Okay, kids, you know the plan. When the ship docks, Gene: bam, bullhorn! Abandon ship! For Bob's Burgers. Then, Tina, when people start coming ashore: pow, coupons! ship passengers. Pow. Try ""poo."" That always gets attention. Oh, yeah, yeah. No. Poo. Use the bullhorn. No. Poo. Never mind. Just don't say anything. Yeah, don't say anything. Where is everybody? Did you hand out the coupons? Yes. Oh, wait. No! What happened? We practiced! We choked, Dad! We planned on handing them out, but then it was noon, and then there was a bug that landed on the ground, and anyway, the day just got away from us. Oh, God Rooty-toot-toot, someone's wearin' a white suit! I think that's the captain, Lin. White pants, take a chance. Permission to come aboard? Permission given! I'm Captain Flarty. Is this restaurant seaman friendly? You know, I've tried burgers from Maine to Mexico, but this is the best burger I've ever had, Bob. Um, thank you. Maybe you could encourage your passengers to try our burgers. I'll do you one better. Join me as a guest chef on our cruise to Puerto Rico. Really? Ooh Your family will accompany you, of course. Ten days, all expenses paid. Wow, that's, that's quite an offer Uh but we really can't afford to leave this place for that long. Come on! Hmph! Also, I'm, I'm supposed to get a meat delivery, and the pickle guy's coming, too, and You're turning me down? Yeah. Sorry? Um Well, then, would you at least do me the honor of cooking just for tonight, Bob, at the captain's table while we're docked? Say yes, say yes, say yes! Um sure. Uh, yes. Yay! Well, it's something. We'll take it. Outstanding! And meanwhile, your family will have, of course, free run of the ship, and I, I do mean free. Take this VIP card, bride of Bob. Ooh Women and children first.  And VIPs! Everyone, listen! This ship is! Fancy? Was he gonna say fancy? Sexy? Pregnant? A grand old dame? Don't tell us! Let it be a surprise! What's so funny? Oh, just, uh funny fish I saw. If it's that one, it's hilarious. If it's that one, it's dead, which isn't funny. Welcome aboard the Windbreaker, Belchers! Uh, thank you, Captain. This is our first time on Aah! Kiki likes you! Go on. Oh, don't be afraid, pet him, pet him. Uh, no, thanks. What is, what is what is he? I want you to pet him. He's a capybara. Aren't you a capybara? It's the largest member of the rodent family After Gene. Mm-hmm. Oh, God. Oh, Kiki! That's a big BM, yes. All right, dinner's at six bells. My first mate here, Mr. Asch, will show you to the galley. And you'll show the captain's table how burgers are done. All right, Bobby, have fun cooking! Yeah. Come on, kids. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I want to see how far Kiki gets with Dad's leg. Yeah! Bob, this is our head chef, Duval. If you'll excuse me, duty calls. My replacement. I hope that you have a hairnet for your face and arms. I'm not replacing you. I'm just cooking one meal for one night for the captain's table. You remind me of me, back when I was the captain's special guest chef for just ""one night,"" Ah, there's the dinner rolls. Why does your timer sound like that? It's French! Okay, over there is the movie theater, and beyond that is the rock-climbing wall. A talking manatee?! I don't know what that is, but I got to see it! All right. Us girls are gonna go hit the spa. Pass. I'm gonna go write dirty words on sunbathers' backs in sunscreen. Yeah, I'd rather not spend all day in a I can go to the spa. Look at you, making hamburgers with your fancy beef for the fancy captain's table, Mr. Squishy-Squashy. Mm-hmm. The regular passengers will be enjoying my fresh vegetable stew. Um, none of those vegetables are fresh. The passengers don't care. They only complain if we run out. And when they complain, the captain gets angry. Is he a little crazy? Shh! He can hear you. He put a microphone in the cheese grater. Act normal. Come on. Hum, hum. Okay. Uh That's it. Humming like normal. Okay. He's a former regional Star Search finalist she's the sexiest sea cow on the ocean. Together they're Herman and Marilyn! Why were you out so late last night, Marilyn? Listen to this one. Always up my butt.  Ooh-ooh-ooh, sexy lady, ocean lady.  This is so much safer than the sun. Come on, cook me. I can't work on minors. Ship's regulations. I could lose my job. Marco, what if I told you I'm holding a life-threatening amount of tension in my glutes? No glutes. Calves? No. Haunches? No. Muffin top? Back fat? No. Top of head only. Deal. Don't stop. Francesca, I don't want to be here, you don't want to be here. So let's make the best of it. Can you do this? Ooh! Cancel the rest of my appointments. Nailed it! Why don't you jump into the ocean and see me sometime? What's your name, handsome? No, it's Gene. Hi, Gene. Hygiene. Something this one could use a little more of. Well, at least my jokes are fresh. Jokes? What jokes? You're the straight man. I use the term loosely. Well, you know loose. I prefer to be called ""flexible."" My pants feel funny! Good-bye! I need a summer drink to go with my new summer glow! Hey, Isaac, daiquiri me! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Who wants apps? I'll take 'em all! Hi, Gene. My scalp massage was fantastic. Thanks for asking. How was the puppet show? Weird. I felt like I had to pee the whole time, but I didn't. Whoo, throw a ripped wedding dress on this daiquiri 'cause it is not a virgin! Go ahead and give yourself a big tip on goldie. And this is my son. You can't tell 'cause he's pale and I'm so dark, but take care of him, all right? Looks like the boy who's sweet on you has a silver spoon sticking out of his mouth. Mm-hmm. I think we just found our meal ticket. Duval, you're sweating into your stew. Eh, saves on salt. Oh, God. I'm glad I'm leaving after this meal. It's like a hundred degrees in here. Oh, sorry. I was hogging the fan. Okay. That doesn't work. Thanks. Cool off. Thank you. Cool off. Take it away. Here you are. Ouch. It's on my face. Ah-ah. Ah-ah. Ah-ah. Come on, lady. Let her play it. You've had plenty. Ugh! Oysters? Yes, they're for the brunch tomorrow. Duval, these oysters are spoiled. You're spoiled. Okay. I don't know why I thought you'd be interested in that, but, uh, don't serve those. I am serving them. Don't serve those. I'm serving them. Captain would like to thank the chef. Oh! I meant Bob. Oh. Huh? Hmm. Psst. Urgent whisper. Meet me later. Cabin 308. Me? No, the other handsome young man I'm whispering to. I wish I could, but we're leaving after dessert. Well, if you're looking for something sweet Who are you whispering to?! Him? Oh, leave him alone. You leave him alone. I think you've embarrassed yourself enough for one night! Remember, cabin 308! Honored guests, let's give a big Windbreaker salute to guest chef Bob Belcher! That's my man! He made your burgers and he made my babies! Ugh. Okay, kids, come on, time to go Are we moving? Bob Belcher, everyone. Where's the land? Where's the land? Where's the land?! Next stop, Puerto Rico. What?! Looks like you'll be my private chef after all. No, you can't do Linda, we're being shanghaied! Shanghaied? Ooh! Ancient Chinese vacation! Yay! Yahoo! Boobies! What? Nothing. All right, steady as she goes, Bob. I wouldn't call a ten-day, all-expense-paid cruise ""being shanghaied."" But you can't force my family to be on this crazy boat for ten days. Oh, come on, Bobby. It's a vacation. You deserve it. We all do. Stop fighting it. This isn't a vacation, Linda, it's a kidnapping. This is a slave ship. You're disoriented, Bob. It happens to some people when they're at sea. You'll adjust once you let yourself relax. Yeah, Bob. Give in. We're not missing anything at home. Hey, Bob, it's Demetri. I'm gonna leave your meat outside. Uh, you and Linda are probably upstairs. Back in five minutes, right, buddy? Ooh-ooh-ah-ah! All right. Let's discuss your concerns on the bridge, Bob, where there's s a ship-t-shore radio you're free to use. You can call someone and make arrangements. All right. All right, good man. I'm gonna let him steer the boat. That always works. You'll get your vacation. Kids, looks like we're on this Puerto Rican cruise for the whole enchilada. So, now I can go to room 308. What's in room 308? I don't know! I wonder if Marco has a 9:00 scalp shiatsu. I'll massage your scalp, Tina. Ow, ow, ow. So, how does this work? The coast guard sends a boat for us or Wait, this isn't the bridge. Mm-hmm. This is the galley. And your home for the next ten days. You're out of your mind. Yes with hunger. Now get cooking, 'cause I've got room for another burger. And oh! Oh, it looks like Kiki does, too. Let him finish! Yes, sir. Go ahead, Bob. Go ahead, run! Unless you can run on water, there's nowhere for you to go! Damn it, you're right! Who's crazy now, Bob? You still are! Ah! Bob. Attention crew, this is your captain. Our mustachioed guest chef has gone missing. First one to find him gets their passport back. All right, let's see what these babies can do. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Francesca! Hey, Marco. I'm four hours older. Maybe you can rub my neck now? Don't tire him out. Do you have penny slots? Yes, we do. Give me a whole roll of pennies 'cause I feel lucky. Who is it? It's Gene. I can't talk long, he's in the shower. I got you this mug. I hope you ""heart"" cruising. Thank you. Uh! Marilyn, who are you talking to? Uh, room service! He's jealous. He never lets me out of his sight. I just need 100 bucks for new headshots, then I can go solo. But where, oh, where will I get $100?! Well, maybe you Oh, Gene, thank you! It'll just be a loan, I promise. Here's your first interest payment. Marilyn, you never wipe the seat! There's sea water everywhere! Run, my little cabbage! Run to $100! Yes! Help! SOS! We've been kidnapped! Sorry, please repeat! We've been kidnapped! My family's on this boat! Is everything okay or is there a problem? Th-The captain is crazy! Help us! All I hear is a funky bass line. I know, because he's doing it! Stop turning the music on! Ha-ha! Very funny! Screw you! What's the matter, Bob, you don't like high energy dance music?! Killer whale, killer whale, killer whale! Orca! Whoo-ha-ha! Yeah! Uh, Bobby? Bobby? Have you kids seen your father? You mean that creepy guy with the mustache? Yeah. No. Hey, we're trying to sleep in here. Sorry. Penny angel! Feels good. Oh, feels good on my face! Pennies, pennies, pennies. Mom, we talked about this. Pennies, pennies, pennies. Mom, stop. Pennies, pennies, pennies. You're better than this. Pennies, pennies, pennies. Come out, come out, wherever you are. You made one mistake, Flarty: you let me live. Passengers, join us tomorrow morning for Poseidon's Brunch, featuring Chef Duval's famous Oysters Onassis. Kiki loves them, and you will, too. Oh, crap. The oysters. Row, row, row the boat Duval? Hmm? Is that you in there? No one's in this pot. Go away. I am the spaghetti. Duval, you're not the spaghetti. I am spaghetti. Let go of the lid. Just spaghetti in here. Val, stop. I'm trying to get off the ship, all right? But first you have to throw out those oysters. If I don't serve the oysters, Flarty will make me teach pole-dancing to seniors. But if you serve them, people can get really sick. It's like the Hippocratic Oath of chefs, Duval, to not make people sick on purpose. Bob Yes? kiss me. What? You know you want to. No, I don't. You didn't just want to kiss me just now? I didn't. All right. But you're right. Come, let's throw out those horrible oysters right now, Bob! Now you're talking. You first. Way in the back. What the hell?! Duval, open the door! You spend the night in there. The captain is complicated, but he knows what's best. Duval! Duval! I will kiss you. Too late. The moment's gone, Bob. Duval! We can do more than kiss! Other things! Duval! Thanks for serving canned meat, Duval. Good morning, Windbreakers! Looking forward to seeing you all at Poseidon's Brunch, featuring Oysters Onassis, as well as the catch of the day. That one is a little shout-out for you-know-who. Hmm? He's gone! Oh, damn it! You get the brunch ready! You! You find Bob! When he runs, it only makes me want him more, right, Kiki? Kiki-Kiki-Kiki. Little help! Oh, sorry. Louise, come here. Over here. Oh, hey, Dad. Flarty is absolutely insane. He locked me in his walk-in overnight. He's gonna serve rotten oysters. We've got to stop him. Oh, Dad, watch this. Clackety-clackety- clackety-clackety, click-click-click- click-clack. Huh? Louise, are you gonna help me or not? Okay, I'll help. All right, good. First, we need to distract Flarty and his crew while I take the oysters from the brunch. Well, I am a master of distraction. Ow! See? I'm gonna get you that hundred bucks, baby. No! Those are for Marilyn! Ah! No! Drop it! We have personnel on every deck looking for Bob, sir. Ha-ha! I got your rat! My Kiki! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety Get her! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety So long, seamen! Clackety-clackety Where are you taking the oysters? Trust me, you don't want these. There's plenty of other things to eat. Don't tell me what to eat! Let go. I'm trying to help. Yeah, help yourself. Argh! They must be running out! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety I did it! I did the distraction! Typically, Louise, when you do a distraction, you don't lead everybody to me, right? Right! Okay, next time. How dare you use Kiki in your sadistic game? My sadistic game? That's right, buster. You kidnapped us. Thank you again. I'm having a wonderful time, Captain. Linda, are you kidding?! Wha? He shouldn't be captain. Anyone would be a better captain than you. Sounds to me what's happening here is a mutiny! Ooh, mutiny? This boat has so many activities! Go ahead, Bob. You want a mutiny? Proceed. Okay. Come on. All right. Let's go. I will. Go ahead. Here we go. Everybody Here we go. All right, let me Call a mutiny. I'm doing it! All right. But if you fail, I'm putting you in a dinghy with nothing but a compass and a biscuit. Okay, fine. So who's with me?! How about you, shorts-and-binoculars guy? You hate it here. Or you, prisoner guy. I saw you locked in that room, right? You've got to be on my side. Don't look away! Oh, Dad. Oh, you're bombing. Oh, forget it! Get the dinghy! Captain, there seems to be a problem with the buffet. Oh, boy. Uh, yup. Ooh, I love this song. Marilyn?! Marilyn! Ugh! Marilyn, are you okay?! I found your eye, but I couldn't get the money. But I will. Kid, forget it. It's just a scam! What? Oh, God. Listen, you're a sweet kid, and you deserve better than an old, an old sea cow like me. But, but Save your buts. Some things just aren't meant to be. Keep the eye. He's got a whole box of them somewhere. Ah What the hell was that about? I know she was a puppet, but she put her hand right up my heart. Aw, sick! Don't worry, Gene. There's plenty of manatees in the sea. But there's not, really, because they're endangered. Mon dieu! Now can we go to some land? These people need a hospital. Give it up, Bob. Your mutiny failed. Duval, make Bob a doggie bag for his dinghy. No, Captain. I'm sorry. Did you say no? Yes, I did. I gave you the best cooking years of my life. And now on behalf of all cooks and all oysters, I demand that you give up your command. There you go, Duval! There you go, Bob! You're relieved of your position, cook. Asch, remove Bob and Duval from the dining room. Asch! Asch! Duval is right, sir. I'm with him. I've cleaned up enough of your messes! Escort the captain to his stateroom. All right, you're doing great. Kiss me! Not now. Not a good time. Then when?! French kiss that Frenchman. Well, you've won, Bob. But remember this What'd he say? Nothing. He just burped. Ah I miss you, Gene. I really, really miss you. Anyone need a mole removed? Ah, peel my back. Look, Marilyn, it's a meat farm. It's beautiful. Ugh! You've got to be kidding me. I'm going to bed, I'm not dealing with this right now. Or maybe ever. Well, I've never felt more rested. Like a protein sunset. It's nice."
"Faster, faster, you beast! This is as fast as it goes, Gene. It has a messed-up wheel. And a lot of junk in the trunk. More to push. Yes, Gene. You love it. Beep-beep! Here we are in Turkey Town. Oh, hello there. Which one of you lucky fellas wants to get eaten by me this Thursday? Me! No, me! Okay, settle down everyone. So Dad's talking to turkeys now? Sheesh, Dad. Get an oven. Your dad loves Thanksgiving. It's his favorite holiday. Will it be you? You're a big one. - You been working out? - A little. Well, you look great. Yeah, it's a little weird, but it's his selection process. It's like The Bachelor, but at the end, the one he chooses gets eaten. That's what happens on the real Bachelor, too. They just don't show it on camera. Hey Bob, what about me? Oh, yeah. Sorry, I didn't see you there. I hope he waits to get it home before he stuffs it. Yes Yes, it's you. Really? Really. Hey, thank you so much. I don't know what to say. It's okay, don't say anything. Oh, Bob. Dad, are you crying? Shh! Let them have their moment. Yes! Come on. Let's go get stuffing. Come on. You're the one! Come on! You are the one! That turkey is our mom now. Uh, Mr. Fischoeder. Um, it's not December yet. And I, I paid November's rent a few days ago. I know I used a lot of pennies, but Stand down, Bob. I'm just here as a friend. A friend who needs to borrow your family for Thanksgiving. What? I need to borrow your family for Thanksgiving dinner. Why? Bob, have you ever been in love? I- I guess. I- I technically am. Hi! Well, Bob, I was in love once, too. Oh, sick! With Shelby Schnabel, the most famous sharpshooter since Annie Oakley. You lost me at ""love"" but brought me back with ""sharpshooter."" She left me for a married oil magnate. Then she left him for a married movie magnate. She's a magnate magnet. More like a homewrecker. Exactly, which is why I need to give her a home to wreck. If you want to wreck your home, buy a bunch of mice, like a normal person. So, Bob, in exchange for one month's rent, can your family pretend to be my family? Yay! Acting! Mmm no. From now on, call me Gene Fischoeder. No wait, Vesuvio Fischoeder. No, wait, Alabama Slammer! I'll need you, too, Bob, to pose as my cook and to roast the bird. Definitely not. Thanksgiving is this family's favorite holiday. Eh. Wait, it's not? No way. Check the rankings. my birthday, Christmas, Halloween Easter Hanukkah Snow Day, Amateur Night Uh, okay, that's Veterans Day Tooth Fairy Eve Not real. Patrick's Day, May Day, Groundhog Day, season premiere of Game of Thrones You've never even seen Opposite Day, Day of the Dead Stop. Dawn of the Dead, Carnivale Angela Lansbury's birthday No. Bath Night Black Friday, then Thanksgiving. Love Black Friday. Black Friday before Thanksgiving? Yeah, 'cause it's dark. Oh, come on guys, what about all of our Thanksgiving traditions? Gene and I always play football. Always go for the feet. Ow! Tina and I break the wishbone. I wished for more wishbones. And Louise, we use the giblets to play Turkey Crime Scene Miami. Cause of death is a missing head. Same as last year. Same as every year. We've got a serial killer on our hands! But everyone's favorite part is my funny toast, right? Like, last year, I said, if you want to open the door to this family, use the tur-key! Tur Oh, my gosh. I just got it. Let's up the ante. Three months rent. Bobby. Two. Gene, no. Purple. What are we guessing? Five. Deal. Wow, I didn't think you were gonna go Okay. Uh well, that'll make a huge difference for us. That's-that's like real money. Goodie. I'll send you all scripts for Thursday. I want you to really get into your parts. Just like I'm going to get into Shelby's parts. Her lady parts. Which are the lady parts? The vagina and the heart. I can't believe my bridesmaid's dress from Ginger's wedding still fits me. You look like an elegant sausage. I hope I can breathe to do my Thanksgiving song. I thought we settled on no song. I hate plays that don't have songs. I'll find a place to fit it in. What's your Thanksgiving song? Uh, no, no, no, no, no.  Pass the cranberry sauce  We're having mashed potatoes  Ooh, the turkey looks great Lin  Thank you for loving me Lin.  Thank you for being there Oh, God.  Everyone's thankin' Lin.  The whole world's thankin' you  Stop, Lin. Stop.  Thankin' us for thankin' you Lin.  Kill the turkey. Please. I liked it. Thank you. Okay, everyone, we're here. Listen, I figured out how to have our own Thanksgiving, stuffed inside Fischoeder's Thanksgiving. Like a turducken. A poultry within a poultry. It's like Inception, with meats. Gene, before dinner, you come in and we'll play tackle in the kitchen. Then send Tina in for the wishbone. And then Louise. And at exactly 8:00, you all say you have to go to the bathroom and then you come to the kitchen for my toast. I'm only half listening. Did you just say you want us to go to the bathroom in the kitchen? No, Louise. Come on, guys, ""Belcher Thanksgiving"" on three, ready? One, two Ah, the Fischoeders! Come inside, family. Yay. Okay, uh You guys go. I'm still excited. Uh, can-can you open the door? Go around the back, cook. Okay. Still gonna be good. This house was originally built by a paranoid arsenic manufacturer. Oh, I bet there are actual skeletons in these closets. And a dungeon full of Dungeness crabs. I bet when you flush the toilets, the water evaporates upwards and forms a rainbow. Two of you are correct. You already signed your liability waivers, so go explore. Awesome! So, Mr. Fisch I was right about the toilets. Huh, I thought the kitchen would be more, uh, mansion-y. Mansions are for the owners, Bob, not the cooks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going get drunk for dinner. Do you mean dressed? Dressed out of my mind. Got to loosen up, you know? Right, right. Got to get my sex face on. I can't wait to see it. Well, Lin, this might not be so bad, right? This Thanksgiving. Neh. What? My hair! Now I got to go redo it. Great. Fine. Guess I'll just be here, alone. With uh with the turkey. My name's Lance. Sorry. With Lance. How are you, Lance? Pretty great. Oh, there are my little Fischies. Thanks for the new outfits. Sometimes you need a make-under. I'm glad you like them. Now, our job tonight is to fool the woman of my dreams into believing that we are a loving, happy nuclear family that she can destroy. Romantic. In order to keep you kids motivated, we're going to be playing by arcade rules. You'll be awarded these tickets for convincing performances as Fischoeder children. Game on. Wait, time out. Okay, game on again. I thought my shoe was untied. The one with the most tickets at the end of the evening can claim a gift from my prize room. The only prize I need is your love, father. And we're off and running. And just like every happy family, we now have a commissioned painng otius, holding the family crest covered in ten schlongs, which of course is German for ""snakes."" Oh-ho-ho. Look at the schlongs. Oh, she's here! She's here! Oh, God. Ooh, I'm so nervous. Places, people! Places! Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. You ready for the oven? I dunno, Bob. It feels weird. We should be doing this at home. I know it's not the same, but it can still be fun. Why don't you take a sip of that over there, Bob? That? Yeah, that green bottle. It's, uh, absinthe. Doesn't this make you hallucinate? Carpe diem! - What? - Seize the day. All right, I'll take a little sip. This can't be that bad. Whoa. Weird. Bob! Bob! Bob! What? Can you leave the oven light on for me? I get scared. So cute. Here's the light. It's too bright. Shelby, may I present my wife, Linda. Pleasure to meet you, Linda. Oh, I like that name, Linda. And I'm Linda. Moving right along, these are my children, Gina, Team, and Lucy. Welcome to our happy home. Any ex-lover of my father's is a friend of mine. What unusual children. Calvin, your sperm did wonderfully. She took my sperm and ran with it. Because I'm his Because I Because I'm his wife. Thank you, Linda. Say, do you kids like bullets? I think all kids like bullets. Think fast! Whoa! Whoa. Wow! Calvin, you kept my old rifle. You weren't carrying a torch for me all these years, were you? Oh, of course not, I was just holding it for you. You can have it back. You don't mind if I cock this thing in here, do you? Cock away. Ow! Loud! That trick's called the ""Reverse Cowgirl."" I bet you could pierce Gene's ear from there. Ooh, do my belly button! Not till you're 18. If you teach me to shoot, I'll teach you to regret teaching me to shoot. And I can teach you to make burgers, like in our restau Eh, eh! What is she talking about? All this talk about shooting is making me thirsty. Why don't we pull the trigger on a glass of wine? Ha-ha. I'm funny. I'm his funny wife. Being a family man suits you, Calvin. Hmm. You look better than I remember. When will Thanksgiving be over? I want it to be Father's Day every day! Very nice. Here, Father, let me refill your glass. You must be dehydrated from being so wonderful. Take it down a notch or two. Hey, Dad, remember when we did that thing that was fun and memorable? That's pathetic. Um, hello, I'm your chef. Yes, this is our chef, uh, Burt. Here are your salads, and now I will, uh, go tackle the turkey. Did you hear that, Gene? I'm gonna go tackle the turkey. Tackle away. Tackle the turkey. Ah! Ow. Oh! That was a great shot. Really, really funny. Do another one. Ooh! Do a crouton. Uh, no, I'm gonna go back to the kitchen now. So, uh, here I go. Back to the kitchen. Gene, go apologize to the cook. Gene! Buddy, football time. Let the traditions begin. Let's make this quick. All right, I got the ball on the one yard line Hut, one! Hut, two! Hut, hut, hut, hike! Ow. Great game, Dad, hit the showers. But we barely played. Gotta get out there and get more tickets. Tickets? What are you talking about? I don't have time to explain this to the help. Fine, just send Tina in. And come back for my toast! You got it, Buddy. One for me and one for Bob. I'm very good at drinking this. Thank you. There's my girl! Okay, time to break the wishbone, right? Oh, crap, it's still in the turkey. Well, maybe we can just pull it out a little early. Ow! Oh, my God, that's hot! Got some skin! Okay, you grab your end and let's do the wish-skin. Um, okay. Great, you won! Yay. What'd you wish for, more wish-skins? More tickets. I'm way behind in the best kid contest. Oh. So you're gonna leave? I'll send Louise in. Louise Belcher regrets to inform you she cannot attend Miami due to a prior comtmenmi Oh, great, I guess I did all this for nothing. Ugh! Remember, Bob, it's all an act. Thanks, Lance, you've been my rock through all this. I love you. Well, it's almost 8:00, so I'll do my toast, and the Belcher Thanksgiving will be back on track. I ""yam"" what I ""yam."" And what I ""yam"" is the luckiest man in the world. Yeah! Was that a great toast or what? You're the toastest with the mostest. Mwah! Aw Family! Thanksgiving! Lance, you're big. Mm-hmm! Oh! This is weird, right? Oh, my God! What? What's going on? It's 8:35! My toast! Oh, Fischoeder Dad, you are hilarious! They're not coming, Bob. Yeah, I know, Lance. Ow! My face! Bobby, I need a chopped onion stat! No one came in for my toast, Lin. My big toast. You can do your toast for us tomorrow. Tomorrow's not Thanksgiving. But tomorrow we'll have five months free rent. Because this is working I think. Now come on, I need an onion so I can cry for my next scene. - Chop-chop! Get it? Fine. - You don't want to come in here for my toast, I'll bring it out there. No, you will not, mister. I haven't even done my song yet. I'm coming out, Lin. Bob, you are drunk. You're drunk. I am not. I've only had half of four bottles of wine. Just bring the turkey out and you can come back in here and take a nap on the floor like you do at home, okay? Now, let's go! - Thank you. - All right! Thank you. That was called Bravo! And this is called ""Better Ode To Dad."" Get ready! I can't compete with that. You know, I am so emotional. What a wonderful family we have. And it's Hmm. It almost, it brings tears to my eyes. Hmm. Just a second You're doing great mom. Really natural. Oh, you are so married. So gosh damn married! Hello, it's me, the cook, Bob Or Burt. And this is Lance. Lance is a turkey. Lance, these are the jerks I mentioned in the kitchen, when I was talking to you. He seems like he's in a good place. So, without further ado, I will now give the traditional cook's toast that I do every year. Uh, maybe you should go back into the kitchen, Mr. Cook. Oh, shut up, Mrs. Fischoeder! Uh, ah, okay. Wow, there must be five months of dishes to do in there. You don't want to sleep in the basement again, Mr. Cook. Are you still talking?! You don't want to sleep without Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

Wow! Everybody wants everybody! This is so exciting. I believe the cook has had too much to drink. Oh, do you believe it?! I believe it in my heart of hearts. Oh, great, everyone wants to hear your beliefs! Back to the kitchen now! I'm not going back. Now this is a holiday. Is it cool if I grab a leg? No. You people don't deserve to eat Lance. Lance is my friend, okay? Ow, Lance, you're burning my arm. Put that turkey down. I pay your salary and your rent. Keep your blood money, Fischoeder! Bobby, come back! Not the gravy! Save me some dark meat! Lance, take care of my father! Get back here with that turkey! I'll get it back. I love a turkey hunt. Wait. What? They'll never catch us! Let's hide here. There he is!

What's he sayin'?! He's just murmuring! Lance? Lance? Oh, he's gone!! Oh, Bobby, I'm so sorry about all this. I never want to be someone else's wife, even for pretend. Sorry we ruined your Thanksgiving, Dad. We were jerks. I'm sorry, too. I promise to tackle you every day for the rest of my life. I've been talking to a turkey for a long time now. But I drank a lot of absinthe, just to be fair. Oh, Bobby, come here. Mwah! Lin, not now, I'm grieving. I lost a friend today. This is so confusing! Well, it's clear to me that this cook has, uh, fathered these, uh, children with, uh, this Oh, give it up. I'm not Fischoeder's wife, all right? He hired us to pretend to be his family so you'd be attracted to him there. I'm touched that you would go to so much trouble for little old me. Oh, you're not old, and you're not little. Not where it counts. In the wabba-wabba. Oh, Calvin, this isn't gonna work. Oh. I respect myself too much not to be the other woman. Wow, you guys are insane. Let's get out of here. We can still have dinner at home. Wait! I almost forgot! I have the most tickets! And I know exactly what I want. Now this portrait will grow old for me and I'll stay nine forever. Oh! This ""absence"" is delicious. It's absinthe, Lin. You're absinthe. Hey, Mom, are you hallucinating yet? Not yet. I need more. Okay, who wants what? I'll take a bullet piece, please. Me, too! I'll have a thigh. There's plenty of shrapnel for everyone don't be shy. Good thing the bullet hit Lance, or else we'd be eating Dad. He'd taste old and bitter.

"Shh. So, Mort, you ordered a small? How small was it? What? Sorry, I'm taking a stand-up comedy class. I think I did something wrong. I thought it was funny. Ugh, the ice cream machine's stuck again. Hey, Mort, you're getting a free medium-- a free large-- a free extra large. Oh. You got to hit it just right, Dad. I said just right! Okay, kids, only one thing to do: ice cream for brunch. Yay! Yeah, all right! Yay, free ice cream! Yeah. Let's just unplug it. Reach behind there and grab the plug. I found my retainer. You don't wear a retainer. Oh, God, you're right! Get it out of my mouth! Never mind, I got it. Aw. Hi, Hugo, hope you're not here for ice cream. I'm lactose intolerant, Linda. Oh. I'm also intolerant of that suspicious-looking bicycle outside, Bob. Uh, why are you telling me? Maybe it's because you're the block captain. But you don't even live on this block. Well, I live in the quadrant and I happen to be the quadrant captain. Quadrant captain-- did you make that up? Did I make up these quadrant captain business cards? Why would you do that? I didn't actually mean to. Well, pick them up. No, now stand down. That bike has been there for 24 hours and the seat's missing. It's clearly abandoned. Fine, I'll take care of it. Don't be block-cocky, Bob, just do it. - Jerk. - Nailed him. You trying to steal my bike? No, someone thought it was, um. It's mine. Want to see the receipt? That's not a receipt. Where do you shop? I really thought being block captain would be more fun, like I'd have a gun or a Taser or something. All I get is this whistle. Don't knock the whistle. Whistles stop hundreds of crimes every year. And thousands of basketball plays. And they make dolphins jump out of the water and eat fish. Dad, you could do that. Bob, I recall you raise either chinchillas or children. Which is it? Uh, children. Good. I'm focus-testing some ideas. I need a new blockbuster attraction at Wonder Wharf. Why don't you focus-test with the kids down at Wonder Wharf? Those sheep? I've already got their money. Besides, these children are a perfect cross-section of American youth. Yeah-- boy, girl, and Tina. I'm a tastemaker. When I talk, people listen. Guys? Mr. Fischoeder, we're adrenaline junkies. Oh. We like our rides pure, uncut, and assembled in ""Méjico."" I want something coming out of here, here, and/or here. The three-hole standard of excellence. Wait, walk me through the holes again. Let me throw some concepts at you. A bounce house full of jelly. Jam Slam! Try chutney. Keep pitching, Barnum. Scare-ousel-- a carousel where you ride on real horse skeletons. You had me at ""horse"" but lost me at ""horse skeletons."" You know, if you're looking for an attraction, this town actually has some interesting movie history. Hog Wash! Not you, Bob, it's an idea. Slide with the hogs. That's not bad. Yeah, well, seriously, in the '80s, they shot one of those shark movies right here in town-- The Deepening 3. Oh, yeah, in 3-D. Right, The Deepening Oh, that shark made me so scared of the water, I spent the whole summer standing up to pee. Then I got into the habit. I like it. There's your attraction. Teddy, you remember The Deepening, right? Remember it? I was in it. Some of us locals worked on that movie. I was Handsome Lifeguard #3. Really? Seriously? Yeah, what? It's just, uh, you know, we're looking at the ""after."" It's kind of hard to picture the ""before."" - Bob. - Guys, the shark is for sale. What?! The shark? A prop house is selling the actual mechanical shark and they're ready to deal. The actual shark? Oh, wow, Mr. Fischoeder, you've got to get that shark. Nah, don't, no, come on. Teddy, yes. You worked on the movie, you should be excited about this. Yeah, but just not that shark. Why, Teddy? I don't want to talk about it. Okay, that's one vote for yes and one cryptic vote for no. Let's run it past the focus group. Five-holer-- nostrils, too. Sounds like a winner. Noooo! Teddy, what is wrong with you? Uh, this ketchup is empty. Can I get a new ketchup, please? Some actor, this shark, a real ham. He chewed more scenery than Nicolas Cage. He really chewed it with his shark teeth. Ha-ha-ha! Ha, ha, ha! Louise, stop. Mort the mortician, everybody. Hey, I see Bob Belcher. All this was his idea. I know what you're thinking. That guy? Yes, the guy with the, uh, food place. Thank you. It's a restaurant. It's called Bob's Now please welcome champion water skier and shark attack survivor Kristi Sanducci. I'd like to thank the jackass who got the left-handed scissors. Kristi Sanducci. Always professional. Now, the real star of The Deepening 3D-eeepening-- the shark. Whoo-hoo, shark, yeah! Ugh, someone has not aged well. What a butterface. We've filled her up with diesel, now let's see what she can do. It's waving at us. Hi. So that one does that. Let's see what this one does. Yes! Thank you, God. Woop, wrong one  oh, here we Oh, boy. Yes, yes, all part of the fun. Can someone pass my arm back up here? Give me that, Louise-- we've got to give it back. No way! I caught it! It's like the bouquet at a wedding. I'm going to get bit next! You having fun? I wasn't-- I Ow. Wow, she's good with that thing. She can do that and park anywhere she wants. And so it begins. Why are we watching a movie about a fake shark when we could be at Wonder Wharf standing next to the real fake shark? Because this is how I want to remember the shark-- in its prime, scaring the crap out of Linda Blair. Fischoeder is crazy to keep that thing going. After what happened to that girl's arm and that lady's poor dog and that guy's balls-- you know, the juggler. Oh, yeah, Fischoeder's crazy to keep it going with all those people lining up, paying to see it, buying souvenirs. Nothing good can come from that shark. It's evil. Oh, there I am again. That's me in the red, white, and blue trunks. What's everybody looking at? Nothing. Nothing. Your body. Oh, my God, Linda Blair's boobs just popped out of her wet suit. Ooh! They're comin' at ya! Huh, this movie's a little bluer than I remember. Let's get to a good part. Outdoor shower scene-- no. Yes. Topless car wash. Yes. Tina, no. Nude hot tub-- no. Yes. Oh, okay, here's some good clean shark. No. See that surfer getting eaten? I made out with her. She had her movie makeup on. Fake organs were coming out of her side. Pretty weird. The '80s-- am I right? You are not wrong. Why is the shark attacking that submarine? The CIA is training sharks to attack Soviet subs, and they're holding the shark's baby hostage in the nude hot tub. So the shark isn't bad; she's just protecting her baby. She's misunderstood. She just needs a friend. It doesn't want to be here. This is exploitation. I'll show you exploitation. Go up there and get me that fin. You want her fin? I've got a guy. He wants it packed in ice and on the next plane. Why does he want a mechanical shark fin? Mechanical shark fin soup. Mmm, that does sound good. Don't cut off her fin. It's her best feature. God, Tina, it'll grow back. Oh, yeah, cut it off. I'm bare-backing a shark. Come on, Gene, chop-chop with the chop-chop. Whoa, it's tippy! Aah, no, Gene, get the fin! Are we safe here? Of course! It's safety tape. They can't just call it that if it's Aah! Aah! Run, shark, run. We set it free. No, we didn't, we were never here. But we were. Remember right now? Yeah, okay, but you know what I just remembered? We were never here. Oh, okay. Man, this movie is, like, 90% nude car wash. Bob, there's some kind of commotion down at the Wonder Wharf. It's like the Running of the Bulls but dumber. Yeah, but with a shark. Uh, yeah, it is a shark. Yeah, it's a shark. Nothing to worry about. Having a little shark problem. Uh, good time to grab a hot dog or some popcorn. Oh, or a hot dog. Mr. Fischoeder, enough's enough, right? You've got to shut off the shark, right? I mean, now. Shut it off? Oh, no, no, I've got a packed park. I can't shut down my top attraction. I mean, I really can't. That thing's on till it runs out of gas. But what if it breaks out of Wonder Wharf? What happens then? Those are reinforced cement walls, Bob, built by somebody-- proud immigrants, I guess, I don't Wha? The shark fell over? That's crazy. We were at the library, right, guys? Yeah, exploring the wonderful world of books and periodicals. Uh, yeah. And microfiche. Oh, no, no, no, no Crap. Oh, my God! The shark's busted onto Ocean Avenue. This is my fault. I have to do something. What? I said, ""This is my fault. I have to do something."" Oh. Block Captain Bob. Yeah. God. On Ocean Avenue, local merchants fear they will become so much fish food, while police and fire officials are caught in a surf-and-turf battle. Meanwhile, local citizens are taking matters into their own hands. The block captain has called an emergency, all-block, shark-stopping meeting That shark is ruining my arts and crafts business! This town might do all right without arts, but crafts?! Where the hell are we gonna be without crafts?! Screw crafts! What about my liquor store? Let me talk! Everybody, listen! Calm down! You calm down! I lost a son! Seriously? A sun quilt. It was beautiful. Listen, we're gonna solve this! Yes, let's listen to Bob. He's the idea man behind the shark. He pooh-poohed all my safety concerns, by the way. What? Thank you. I have to run. N- No, I said it might be cool to get a mechanical shark. I didn't turn it loose. Yes, he did! No, I didn't! Nobody knows who did! Yeah, stop this insane witch hunt! It could've been anyone who wasn't at the library. The library? It's no use! They know we knocked the shark over! Wait, what? You did? No! That's just an expression. Hey, did you knock over the shark today? You know I did! You're the family from hell! They're destroying the town! Let's have a town meeting to decide what to do with the Belchers! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Teddy, what are you doing? I'm trying to get everyone's attention, but I don't have any nails. Okay, so what do you want to say? I have something to say. Yes. What? I told you not to get that shark! I told you he was trouble! Now we need to join together to stop him. Ow! Don't you see? Us fighting with each other, that's what he wants! Ow! Teddy, stop! Yes, Teddy, thank you. Thank you. So, yeah, we've got to join together to stop the shark. Let's put our heads together, right? Block captain brainstorm. No bad ideas. Go. Topless car wash, like in the movie! Topless car Don't write that down. Uh, Linda said there were no bad ideas, Bob. Well, she was wrong, Hugo. Yes, like when she married you. What? What? I heard you mutter something. Yes, and when someone mutters, that means they're muttering to themself. : Huge mistake. Well, I heard you. What? I heard you mutter. Oh, really? What did I say? ""Linda made a huge mistake."" So we agree. Ha-ha. Someone else? Listen to me. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why you want to kill it. It just wants to go home. Tina, it's a machine. It's dumber than our toaster. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know why we put bagels in it. Oh, my God. Okay, we got four good ideas. Well, four Hail Marys we could try. Let's stop the shark! Or not. Let's stop the shark! Or not! Let's stop the shark! Or not. If a spike strip can stop those drunk Shriners, it should be able to stop a shark. Here it comes! Here it comes! Ouch. Okay, we've given the shark spikes. I knew that would happen. That oil's gonna keep the shark from getting any traction. Ah And we made it faster. Bravo, Bob! You want to catch a fish, you gotta think like a fisherman, right? Okay, now the shark is electrified! All you're doing is making the shark more dangerous, Bob. I can see that, Hugo! It was an FYI. Bob, the shark's getting pretty close to our restaurant. It's all right. We've saved the best idea for last: the big hole. Why'd we save our best idea for last? Because we didn't know it was the best idea until the other ideas were really terrible. Stupid. Anyway, we dig a big hole, the shark falls in and hopefully, end of our problems. Beginning of China's problems! Sorry, China! They'll nail it. They're really smart. Come on, keep going. Climb into your hole, you big mouse! Turn around! It's a trick! Ah-ha-ha! You did it, Bobby! The shark is gone! Gone, but not forgotten. Wait, what are we talking about again? Maybe you're not such a horrible, greasy, perverted, shabby, two-bit, filthy, disgusting pig. All right, thanks, thanks. What was that? That thing's still moving down there. But we buried it. I think it just ate its way into our basement! Dad, can we keep it? The shark is in our basement?! Well, there's only one way to find out for sure. Kids, stay here. Duh. Yeah, I thought our basement was scary before it had a shark in it. Bob, stop. You've done everything you can. You don't have to go down there. This whistle says I do. That whistle blows! Enough talk. This ends now. Mort and I will go with you, Bob. What? Oh, I mean, yes! Thanks, guys. That means a lot. Oh, good news, everyone! The dream team's on it! Ahab, Gray-hab, and Flab-hab! You want to come, Hugo? No, I'm good. Crowd control. Back up! Back up! Real quiet, all of a sudden. Quiet as a morgue. Morgues aren't all that quiet, actually. Maybe it finally ran out of gas. We could come back tomorrow. No! We gotta make sure it's dead, and then we gotta cut it up in little pieces so it never hurts anyone again! Whoa, Teddy, calm down. What happened with you and that shark, anyway? Sorry, Bob. You see, It's personal between me and this shark. We had a little run-in, back when I was working on that movie I was chatting up that cute surfer girl. Ohh! Ugh! Well, you can forget about getting any of this! She could've been the one, Bob! I hit the craft service table pretty hard after that. That's when I started getting fat. Uh, I don't understand. Why aren't you mad at the shark operator? Oh, yeah, that's a good point. No, no! The shark drove him to it. It's evil, and now I'm fat. You're not that fat, Teddy. I'm wearing a guy girdle. It's called a Boydle. Look at me. Look at me! Okay, Teddy Well, you know, look at me. Hi, Teddy. I'm Bob's belly. Oh, you always know what to say, Bob. Over here! I'm Mort's belly. Huh? What? We're not doing that bit anymore? What's going on in there? Did you guys hear that? Oh! We're gonna need a bigger restaurant! Oh, come on. Sorry. Hang on, Mort! Not fat enough! Mort!! No! I think Mort got eaten. Oh, I should've laughed more at that belly-talking thing he did. Mort, are you okay?! I'm out! I'm literally grasping at straws! Ahh! Teddy, you're being crushed! No, my Boydle's protecting me, but I don't know how long it's gonna hold! This is what you want, isn't it?! This is what you want! I'm torn. Dad raised me, but the shark gets me. If the shark eats our restaurant, is he our new boss? Shark boss! I'm blacking out, Bobby! I don't know how to stop it. We've tried everything! It's too bad we can't make it die from cancer, like in the movie. It didn't die from cancer, Teddy. Oh, no, you're right. They shot the cancer ending, but it tested really bad. It didn't have the ""pow."" Really? Cancer? No pow? Yeah, they shot a whole new ending, remember? They went and poured wet cement down its throat. Yeah, and that would be really helpful if we had a cement mixer! Maybe we do. The ice cream machine. She's right. We could fill up the shark with ice cream. That might mess it up, right? I chose you, Dad. Thanks, Tina. Over the shark. Thanks. Because I thought Yes. Originally, it looked like maybe I would Yes. Oh. Yeah, Dad, who was Tina really gonna choose? A broken-down wreck with the dead eyes, or a fake shark? Aww You like that, Mom? Yeah. Okay, let's give it a try. All I have to do is plug it in. Ow! Hurry, Bob. Some of the teeth are getting under the Boydle! Stretch, Bob! Stretch! You call that stretching? Got it! My feet are getting cold. Must be making ice cream. Oh, my Boydle came off! You got my Boydle, but you don't got me, you shark! It's working! The shark's getting all logy! I've had dreams like this. It's over. No, Bob. Die! Die! Die! Now it's over. No, it's not dead! Just kidding, everybody. Just kidding. How shark was it? I still feel like I'm doing that wrong. Whoa, Bob! I love what you've done with the place. Listen, I'm gonna be out of town for awhile, but, uh, keep it up. Uh, we-we should talk about repairs for No. Okay. I'm going to miss you, shark. Hmm, I'm gonna miss you, too, ice cream machine. He died the exact way I want to go: destroying the restaurant. Hey, how the hell are we gonna flush this thing down the toilet? Whoa, somebody lost their Boydle! It's mine now. Ah, my little Bobby Block Captain. You saved the town. Eh, just part of the job. You're fired! I can't take credit for everything, Olsen, but as quadrant captain, I will. You're welcome. Who wants soup?"
"Wow, still can't believe this sale. Six thousand low-fold dispenser napkins for $58? What are they thinking? I don't know. Yeah, and they're two-ply. This is this is a great day. A really great day. Wow, look how big and empty the parking lot is, huh? What do you say you get behind the wheel? What would I do behind the wheel? Drive. Is that legal? Well, no, but my father let me drive when I was about your age. Call it a perk for running errands with your dad. Let's make this kitty purr. Mm, go ahead. Try a turn. Tina, why are you groaning? You're doing fine. Rela Tina, relax. Easy, easy. Okay, okay. Tina, you're kind of headed toward the only other car in the lot. You have plenty of time to turn, Tina, so just go ahead. Turn one way or the other You're just swerving back and forth. Turn one way and stick with it, Tina. Tina, for the love of God, turn away or stop! The brakes, Tina! On the left! You're about to hit that car! The brakes! Hit the brakes! Oh, my God, it's bad. I ruined the car! You did. You really did. Okay, uh Well, that's Ugh. At least there doesn't seem to be any damage to the other car. No, I see a dent! There's a dent! That-That's a ding. Not even. It's like a little scratch. N- No, it's a dent! All right, we'll leave a note. You know, then again, for all we know, that probably was there, right? We have to leave a note! We have to leave a note! Okay, okay! You're- You're so honest. Who raised you? I don't know. Da It was me. I did. What's with the cab? Yeah, where's the car? Um, the car is in the shop. There was a little accident and What?! Wait, Lin, Lin. What? What happened? Calm down. We hit a parked car. Are you okay? What happened? My baby, wa Look at me. Look at me. Oh, God. We're fine. Tina is fine. Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby. Wait, how'd you manage to hit a parked car? Are you drunk? No. You smell like wine. We-we were coming out of the restaurant supply store and Hold on. Bob's Burgers. Oh, hi, Jimmy. Yeah, he's right here. It's Jimmy Pesto. Ugh, what does he want? Hello, Jimmy. Hello, Bob, want to hear a knock-knock joke? No. Knock-knock. I'm really not in the mood. Knock-knock! Ugh, who's there? You hit my car, dumbass. Eh, classic knock-knock. You've got to be kidding me. That was your car? Did you or did you not hear my knock-knock joke? O- Okay, look, what happened was Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tell it to your insurance company. Oh, come on, Jimmy. I don't want my rates to go up. I'll just pay whatever the damage is and No way. Not on your salary. I don't have time for you to work out an eight-cents-a-month payment plan. Ha. He's poor. Fine. We'll go through my insurance. Good-bye! You drive like a fart! Fart. So what happened? So anyway, I was driving, and I ran into what turned out to be Jimmy Pesto's car in the parking lot. But, Dad, I was Come on, Tina. Help me carry the napkins down to the basement. Okay. Help you carry napkins? Yeah, Dad, be sure to lift with your legs. Ha-ha. Use the hand truck. You shouldn't be carrying anything at your age. Yeah, you're pregnant. You sit down, Dad. Hey, while your car is in the shop, I can drive you guys around. Oh, thank you, Mort, but we don't need to go anywhere. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we'd get to ride in the hearse? There's lots of places we need to go. What? Where? Nightclubs, day clubs, smoky cafes Chinatown, Thai Town Library. Great, I'm heading out now if you want to come with. I call shotgun. I call coffin. No fair, I want coffin! Good, it was a trick! I'm too scared to ride coffin. So we just have to say I was driving, okay? That's lying. That's not right. That's true, Tina. Lying is wrong, and you should never do it. Unless an idiot named Jimmy Pesto makes you go through insurance, which he is. So we have to lie this one time. What's next? Perjury? Human trafficking? Look, our insurance will go up a little, but we'll be fine. We just can't tell anyone about it. Even Mom? Ugh, especially Mom. She can't lie. But I can't lie, either. You know what, it's not even really a lie. It's a secret. It's our shared secret. Huh, maybe if I had a backstory? A backstory? Do I have a boyfriend in this scenario? Uh, we should probably just stick to the necessary facts. Oh, okay. Fine, all right, you have a secret boyfriend in this scenario. One that you can't ever talk about. What's his name? Um, Sebastian. He plays lacrosse, and he loves me. Mm-hmm. But he loves lacrosse more. Uh, yeah. How long is his hair? I- I-I don't know, but it's greasy. Yes. So Mort, what special features does this baby have? Special features? Like what? You know, like an oil slick in case you're being followed by mourners? Oh, no, no, nothing like that. Is there a hammer in case one of them comes back to life? No, no hammers. I guess you have to use your bare hands then. You're cute. Yeah. Whoa, how'd you swing that? Oh, the police escort? In addition to giving you kids a lift, I'm also on my way to a funeral. Killing two birds with one stone. So there's a dead body back there? And two birds. And two buns! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Take that, po-po! Come on, kids, please. This is not Sorry! Oil slick, go. Why are you wearing a hair net? Because stress is making my hair fall out. Look at me. Tina, you have the fullest head of hair in the family. I would kill for that hairline. I believe you would. Take it easy. Take it easy. This is all wrong. I'm going to jail. Or hell. Or hell jail. What's for lunch today? Your lies! No! That's what we had yesterday. Look, I know it's hard, but I swear it will get easier. Just hang in there; we'll get through this. Hey, there. What can I get for you? Oh, I'm not having anything, but I do have a few questions. I'm Chase Kaminsky, your insurance adjuster. What's that sound? Uh, uh, what sound? I don't hear anything. Oh that, that, yes, I hear that. That's probably my daughter. Is she all right? I- I-I think it's a song. She's always singing, so it's probably a song. You know, kids and their music. Uh, oh. She passed out. Better go check on her. Everything's fine, Tina. We're going to go out there and act like we didn't do anything wrong, which we didn't, kind of. But lying to Mom was one thing; lying to the insurance guy is another. Okay, stop, stop making that sound. He hears it. Okay. All right, let's-let's have you go down to the basement and, um, sweep something. Like dirt? Yes, like dirt. So, I was in park, but I thought it was in drive, so I was thinking, ""Uh, why am I not moving?"" Yeah, well, we've all done that. I mean, I haven't, but somebody must have. We you did. Yeah, I did. Oh, God. Uh, this is my daughter, Tina. Laughing is another one of her noises. Oh, is that laughing? I was in the car with my dad. Uh, in the passenger seat, she was. Yeah, where passengers sit. Right, so after I put it in park, and I was moving, I thought, ""Am I in neutral?"" So I shifted into gear and lurched forward. And then a butterfly flew in the window and Dad started swatting at it. A butterfly? What butterfly? Wha-What butterfly? Hey, Linda, kids. Uh, this is Chase. He's from the insurance company. I was just telling him what happened, uh Uh, yes, I was I was just getting to the butterfly part of the story. I thought it was a bee, and I was startled. So I was, ah swatting at it. Dad's scared of butterflies. Uh-oh, Dad, look out. There's a ladybug! Stop it. All right, so, uh, anyway, back to the story, uh, Chase. Uh, I mean, not a story; it's the truth. Um, so I swerved and A cormorant flew in the window. What's a cormorant? It's a kind of seabird. We learned about them in school. In China they use them to catch fish. Yeah, thanks, Tina. Sorry I left out the cormorant. A cormorant? What an auspicious sign. Anyway, that's how I hit the car. Butterfly, then cormorant. Okay! Really? We'll get your claim check cut right away. Thanks for your business, Bob. Thank you. That was easy, right? Phew. One more thing. Aah! Aah! It just occurred to me to ask you Here it comes. I'm hosting a barbecue this Sunday. My caterer fell through. Boom, I meet you. What do you say? You ever take this show on the road? Oh, um, cater your party? Mm-hmm. Sounds great. We'll do it. Our only other employees are the kids. Is that is that okay? Great! Here's my number. Huh. See you all on Sunday. Great. Where's the bathroom in this thing? Under here? No. No, it's not there. Yeah, it's fine. Well no, just Can you just hold it a little longer? Well, it's not a problem. No, no, please. Don't worry about it. I'm meeting a grieving widow in ten minutes. Oh, I have to go, too. Hey, look! ""Three bedroom, two bath."" We can both go. Ah, all right. But make it quick. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Everything okay in there? Everything's great. I had to pee, but one thing led to another. Bam, I showered. So our grandpa died. That's him out front. He's in the to-go box. His last wish was to be buried at the house he was murdered in. Yeah, with the shovel he was murdered with. Can you believe he was poisoned with a shovel? We'll take it! Kids. Ah, perfect timing. Mortimer, give this fellow a fair price for the house, and we'll meet you in the car. Hey, thanks for the lift, Mort. Uh, shouldn't be more than a couple hours, so, uh are you gonna wait here or come back? Well, it's an hour back to my place, so I guess I'll just sit in the hearse. Maybe grab a nap in the back. Uh-huh. A nap in the back of a hearse? Who says morticians are creepy? Ha-ha. Well, all this gas is getting pretty expensive. A hearse doesn't exactly sip gas. It's a big vehicle, you know? Uh-huh. But you know, if you would like to chip in that would be so great because Great, we'll see you in a few. Okay. All right. See you soon. That's fine. Why are we even here? You said it would all be over after the one lie. Well, we couldn't exactly say no to Chase, Tina. That would make it worse. After the barbecue, I promise, everything will go back to normal. Will it? Or is that another lie? Whoa, easy. You've gotta calm down. Let's, let's, let's see your ""everything is okay"" face. Um, no, no, no, that's, that's not, that's No, that's bad. No, don't do that face. Like, like this? No. Just stop doing the face. How about this? And stay with me here by the grill. That way your sweat will look more natural. So then a butterfly spooks him, and he crashes our freaking car! Hey, your wife has 'em roaring over there, talking about your little fender-bender. Uh. Uh, Tina, I'll be right back. Mm Just try and keep the meat off the ground. Okay You heard of the butterfly effect? If a butterfly flaps its wings, Bob crashes his car! Okay, Linda. Let's, uh, settle down. Oh, what? I'm making conversation. And he says I'm a bad driver! Ah! Ah! Ah! Tina! Oh, call the fire department! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh, my face! Tina, no one's blaming you for this, but what wrong thing did you do?! I don't know. I was cooking like normal. Maybe I had the flame too high? Why would you let me around fire? All right, Tina, calm down. This is, this is bad, but it was an accident. We'll, we'll tell Chase we're sorry. And that we lied about the car accident. What?! No. No-no-no-no-no-no. We're, we're in too deep now. We have to stick to our story. Oh, this is horrible. It's horrible! We barbecued that poor man's house. Wait, who's this ""we""? I was locking Gene in the garden shed when Tina was playing Firestarter. I burrowed out like a little mole! Louise is right. I'm a firestarter and a jinx. Yep. And I'm going to destroy this family. You're the reason I'm fat! I know. Oh, my God, Chase. I, I don't know what to say. We're, we're so sorry. Bob, it's okay. This was still a better-than-average party for me. Really? But your, but your house. Your-Your really nice house is gone! Well, this might surprise you. I have insurance! Yeah, I lost a lifetime of memories and my cat Spritzal. I killed your cat?! Well, no, Spritzal died last week. Natural causes. She's, uh, she's peeing in God's shoes now. Too soon! But her ashes were in there. Well, technically, they still are, aren't they, buddy? Look, you all go home and just forget about this, okay? I'm just so grateful that no one got hurt. Ow. Coming through! I'm a firestarter and a jinx. And I'm going to destroy this family. We're in too deep now! We have to stick to our story! Huh?! Wha?! Screaming! Wha? Wha? Gene! What the heck is going on? My stomach is in knots. Did you eat rope again? Tina, sweetie, is this about the fire? Because houses can be rebuilt. No one was in it, honey. But my conscience is still on fire. Okay, enough. I, I can't stand to see Tina like this. Listen, I lied about who was driving our car during the accident. Huh?! I let Tina drive a little in the parking lot. No fair! Mort doesn't let us drive! And then I made everything worse by lying about it. Why didn't you tell me? Because you're terrible at keeping secrets. You just blurt everything out. Sorry we're late! Bob had diarrhea!  Running down the gutter  With the piece of bread and butter, diarrhea.  Lin! I love you, Mom. Anyway, I shouldn't have kept this from you. I was wrong. Stop it. I'm going down to Chase's office first thing in the morning to come clean. I'm going with you. Yes! Good. We'll tell some truth! ""Hey, while your car's in the shop, I can drive you guys around."" Why did I say that? What's wrong with me? Oh, hey, guys! What can I do for you? Hi, Chase. Uh, I have something I need to tell you. Is it about my dead fish? 'Cause I already know. I wasn't driving when I had the car accident. Tina was. It's true. I was. I knew that. You knew? You knew? What, you thought you were fooling me with that cockamamie story about a butterfly and a bird? A cormorant. Whatever. Of course I knew! I figured if I scratched your back, you'd scratch mine. Wait. I-I don't want to scratch your back. You already did. Tina's ""accidental"" fire? No accident. It was an accident, I swear! What are you talking about? We're all in on this, compadres! I looked the other way on your fender-bender. You gave me a convenient cover to burn down my house. Why would you burn down your own house? 'Cause I'm covered for twice what it's worth. And no one is gonna question my claim when little Tina was left in charge of the grill. How did you know I was going to start a fire? Well, you didn't. My good buddy odorless kerosene did. Ugh! So I'm not a jinx. I, I can't believe what you're saying. Well, believe this. It's your cut! My cut? I'm I'm not taking your money. Oh, think about it, you two. We'll be the three amigos of insurance fraud. Restaurants are disaster magnets! Broken pipes, slip-and-falls, her. Aw Hey. I make sure you get the maximum payout, minus a small percent, of course. Hey, we're not gonna commit insurance fraud. Yeah, that doesn't sound like something you'd do. Oh, wait, you already did! Your daddy could go to jail! Huh?! Huh! Huh! Chase, you can't be serious Huh! Huh! Serious as a judge. Judges, by the way, are most interested in the testimony of the insurance adjuster. And I will testify against you. Oh, I got it! You'll flood your basement! Why are you doing this to us? Because you're my golden goose. And I'm not letting you get away. You are the worst insurance adjuster. But the world's greatest uncle. So, Chase is blackmailing us. And if we don't go along with his scam and flood the basement, he's gonna turn me in. Flood the basement? But my collage supplies! They're just magazines, Mom. They are '90s Cosmopolitans from the '90s. Lin, let's focus on the blackmailing. Huh! Huh! We gotta take that son of a bitch down! Language. Sorry, Mom. Tina's right. We need to come up with an idea to get us out of this. Huh! Huh! Huh! Tina, stop doing that. It's disturbing and scary. Wait. That's it! What is? What if we scare Chase so bad he'll never want to see us again? Hmm. That could work. Scare him? How? Boo! Ah! Good morning, Bob! Or should I call you ""Rob"" since we're gonna be stealing money together? I'm sorry. It was too good to resist. Yeah, that was hilarious. Uh, so anyway, my basement flooded. Luckily, we're covered. Uh, Bob, will you send the kids up? Their breakfast is getting cold. They aren't down here. What are you talking about? Of course they are. They were playing down in the basement. The basement?! Bobby, what's the matter? My babies! No! Agh! Agh! Oh, my God, no! I went too far! What have I done?! My kids! My children are dead! Bobby, why?! Bob, I can't handle this! I never saw this Okay, I'm leaving! I'm sorry! You'll never hear from me again! And scene. Eh? Great performances by all three of us, huh? Oh. You figured it out. Come on. You didn't really expect me to buy that, did you, Bob? Uh, sorta. Yes. Your acting is terrible. You closed the door. You didn't even try to resuscitate your kids! Yeah, It turns out the kids can't hold their breath that long. And we were gonna give 'em snorkels, but, uh Snorkels. Yeah, uh, you know what? Never mind. Snorkel. Kids, come upstairs. Now let's get this paperwork started! Get this claim processed! And remember, this stays just between us. No one can ever know. Bob, Lin, oh, good. You're, you're both here. Listen, I, I got something stuck in my craw. Not a good time, Mort. Uh, you know, it's never a good time for these things. You're my neighbors and I love you, and I, I love your kids. I mean, up to a point But I'm not a taxi, okay?! All right. Sorry, That came out wrong. A little over the top. Let me, let me start over. Look, we're getting our car back tomorrow. So we don't need any more rides, Mort. Yeah, we left you a note and a thank-you package on your doorstep. Oh, so you did. Okay. Well, I mean, that wasn't necessary. What a lovely surprise. All right, I'm gonna go now. Okay, Chase. You, you caught us. But you're playing with fire Fire. and water, literally. And eventually, somebody is going to get hurt. Gene, stop it! Ah! Don't insult me, Bob. You're new to this. I'm the pro. I've pulled hundreds of scams, and I'm gonna pull hundreds more. Now for our next fraud, I'm thinking lightning. A big surge could mess up all these incredibly expensive appliances. Am I nuts? Yes. Well, off to process this flood claim. Talk soon, partner! Oh, my God. We're stuck with this guy forever. Like me and this piece of corn in my teeth. Right, corn? Are we? I've pulled hundreds of scams, and I'm gonna pull hundreds more. Ha! Tina, that's brilliant! Oh, sure, when she does it, it's brilliant. That scammer is going to the slammer! Buh-bye, baby! Tina, do you realize what this means? You saved the family. I guess it's all part of learning to drive. Uh, the, this one. For our next fraud, I'm thinking lightning! Hey! Hey, Bob! Bob, look! That's you. Well, I'm glad this week is behind us. This was the worst week of my life. But I'm better for it. This was the worst week of your life, Tina? You got to crash a car and burn down a house! I got to do nothing! Fine. Here, Louise, you can break this plate. Ah! No fair! I want one! Yeah! That felt good. I want another one! No, that's it. Here, give me one! Stop! Lin, what are you doing? What? They're I hate these plates. Stop breaking plates! Lin! Ah! - Ah-ha-ha, it's fun. - Smash! - Watch me break this plate and the window! - No!"
"Hey, remember my fart from last night? Be more specific. Maybe this will ring a bell. Oh, yeah. I taught it to love its country. It's ""Stankee Doodle Dandy."" Cool. Play something else. Play ""Happy Birthday"" 'cause my birthday's coming up. Play ""Happy Stankee Birthday."" Do it. Do it. It'll be funny. Do it. Hey, Courtney, take a chill pill. Oh, my gosh. Uh No, it's all right. No, guys, guys. I will take a chill pill, I will. Because I have a congenital heart condition, and I take them every day. I had shingles once. I have a cut on my leg. Those things aren't congenital. Show's over. We got to get our congenitals to class. Hi, Lin. Hey, Gretchen. Just came by to return this bottle of water you left at the salon. When did I leave that there? Two weeks ago. Oh. Hey, do you guys have a lost and found? Yeah. Why? What'd you lose? Oh, yeah, you lost weight. Good for you. Wow, what's your secret, Gretchen? I went on the Skin Deep diet. You can only eat fruits and vegetable skins, and the weight just fell right off. One time, I accidentally ate a banana peel, but I didn't look like you afterwards. Whoa. Humph, err Well, I got to run. Hey, Gretchen. Wow, you look great. Did you lose weight? Little bit. Look-- my tattoo's not stretched out anymore. It almost looks like a regular dolphin. Wow, yeah. Look at my thigh tattoo, Bobby. Oh, let me pull my shorts up here. It's okay. Okay. All right. Bye, Gretchen. Bye, everybody. Bye. You're perfect the way you are. Don't lose one more pound. I won't, probably. I don't know. Gretchen looks good, huh? Yeah, I guess she looks all right. Why is your eye twitching? Because I'm very happy for her. So what if she's the hot one now, and I'm the one with the muffin top. Oh, come on, Lin, you look great. I like your muffin top. So you think I have a muffin top? What? No, no, I said No. I'm going on that diet, Bob, and when I'm done, I'm gonna look like Gretchen's skinny sister. Gretchen's sister is skinny, Lin, but it's because she's on methamphetamines. Whatever works, Teddy. Don't judge! If you guys are trying to cut the line, forget it. Lenny's giving us backwards cuts. Backwards cuts? They found a loophole. Hey, Gene, guess what? What, Rupa? I know someone who likes you. Is it Lenny? 'Cause I want backwards cuts. I think she means someone like-likes you. Uh-huh. Oh. Is it the school nurse? She said I was the perfect temperature. Can't tell you. It's a secret. Aw, I guess we'll never know now. Well, whoever she is, I hope she appreciates that I can do this. Ah, ah, baa, baa, ba. Dun dun da-dun-dun, baa-baa. I don't get it. Bop. Bop. I try and try and he ends up with the secret crush. Maybe don't try so hard, girlfriend. Okay, I see your point. Who do you think like-likes Gene? ""Puberty, puberty, puberty."" That's all I hear when you guys talk. But we're his sisters. What if we don't approve of her? Oh, judging people. Well, when you put it like that Bad hair, bad breath, bad attitude, eyes, nose, mouth, posture So, we know it's not Sarah, Wendy or Lizzie. Maybe it's Julie? Nah, she like-likes Lenny Destefano. Geez, who isn't on the Lenny Destefano train. It sold out even before it left the station. Uh-huh. What about Rupa? Maybe she told us about the secret crush to throw us off her trail? No. Rupa's not that smart. She thought elbow macaroni was made of elbows. Oh, and that's not true. Maybe it's someone we're not thinking of. Courtney Wheeler! Hi, Gene. I heard somebody like-likes you. Do you know who it is? Nope. She's in your grade, and she thinks you're really cute. And she has blond hair. And she's looking right at you. It's me! Oh, boy. So, do you like-like Courtney? Do you want to go out with her? Uh Uh Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You like-like her, right? Yes. Uh I guess? Oh, my God, I can't believe he said yes, But he did. You guys are going out. Let's make it official. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Aw. Uh, is this forever? Oh right, I forgot. Oh, no. There it is. It's all, eh, written down. Uh-huh, uh-huh. All right. Well, thank you. Bog Harbor Catholic has an opening. You'll just need to wear a skirt and go by the name Eugenia. Louise, what are you talking about? Gene's switching schools. Gene, why do you want to switch schools? Are you being bullied? Who's hurting my baby boy? I wish I had a bully. This is way worse. Courtney Wheeler like-likes him. Oh! Courtney asked Gene if he wanted to go out with her, and he said yes. All right, Gene, you're on the board. Way to go. I hear dating bells. So, who's Courtney? Courtney Wheeler is the most annoying girl in my grade. In school. In the world. Oh, well, what's so bad about her? She talks too much, she breathes too loud, and she's always sucking on her necklace. And her breath smells like sweat. Yeah, and she talks on her phone when she goes to the bathroom. It's confusing. Hey, how's it going? Good. Thanks for asking. I'm in the bathroom. Where are you? I'm in the bathroom, too. I thought you knew that. Sorry, hold on. Some girl thinks I'm talking to her. Oh, well get rid of her. I'll wait here. Gene, then why did you say you'd go out with her? Her friends were staring at me! I didn't want to be a jerk, Dad. Well, you're not being a jerk if you don't like her. Like-like her. Like-like her. Your father's right, Gene. When did Mom start eating garbage? These are potato peels. I'm on the Skin Deep diet. I'm only allowed to eat fruit and vegetable skins. It's delicious. You know, the longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be to tell her how you really feel. Oh, yeah? When are you gonna tell Mom how you really feel? Huh? Huh? What'd he say? Hi, Gene. - Hi, Courtney. - Aww. So cute. We're walking into school together. 'Cause, you know, now we're going out. Take my hand. You should know when you hold hands with me, you hold hands with everything I've ever eaten. I don't care if they're sticky. Just makes them harder to pull apart. So cute. Unbelievable. You guys, we're going in. Yech! Do you know where to hit me on my head to give me amnesia? Right here. Who am I? Tina, try again. Who am I? Tina, try again. Who am I? Tina, harder!  We go together like rama-lama-lama   Ka-ding-ka-dingy-dong  Remembered forever  As shoo-bop-shoo-wada-wada  Yipidy-boom-di-boom  Chang-chang, changity-chang-shoo-bop   That's the way it should be  Wah-ooh yeah! Aww.  We're one of a kind Yech!

All I had for breakfast was kiwi fuzz. It was like licking your father's back. Ugh. Thanks, Lin. What? Gene, let me get this straight. I'm driving you on a date with a girl who you don't like and should've broken up with by now? Like-like. Tina, I know. Actually, it's a double date. Julie and Lenny Destefano are coming. Julie better not get too attached to Lenny. That is one stallion that won't be broken. Here, Dad, you'll probably need ear plugs. And if those aren't enough, hit yourself over the head with this. I'm sure she's not that bad, Louise. Hmm she kind of is. Ehh you would be wrong. Prepare to be surprised. Dad, take it, take it. I don't even need it back, just take it. Good-bye. All right, well, good luck finding a drive-thru hammer store. Kick, kick, kick. Courtney, will you stop kicking the seat? I'm not kicking. Kick. Really? I can feel it. And you're saying kick. No. It's not me. Kick. Well, Julie's too far away. And it's not Lenny. Not me, Mr. B. Oh, I know, Lenny. Maybe you're just imagining it. Kick. Did you feel that? Yes. Kick. How about that? Courtney, please. Courtney can't control her legs because she has a congenital heart condition. What do those things have to do with each other? What does anything have to do with each other? Oh, my God. Gene. What? She's so annoying. I know. You have to break up with her. I know. Get back in the car. We can drive away. Seriously? I think so. Forget it, forget it. It's too late. Here she comes. I don't know how to break up with her, Dad. Just Oh hi, Courtney. We were just talking. Just chatting. Come on, Gene, let's go, come on! I just want to finish these chats with Dad. Dad, I just want to chat with you some more. We have to go get seats in the back row 'cause people complain about the way I chew for some reason. Gene, I'm so sorry. I want to break up with Courtney, but it's so hard. My life is more difficult than anyone else's on the planet, and, yes, I'm including starving children, so don't ask. Why don't we practice? Tina, you be Courtney. Gene, break up with her. Go ahead, you can do it. Courtney, I think we should break up. Oh, okay. Please don't be sad. No, I get it. It's fine. It wouldn't have worked anyway. This is so hard! Can't I just wait till we go to different colleges and lose touch? You're doing good. You're doing good. Come on, try it with me. Courtney, I think we should break up. What?! You'll never break up with me! I will kill you first! Forget it. I'm not doing it. Yes, you are. Again! Courtney, I think we should break up. Nooooo! Again! I think we should break up. Courtney, I think we should break up. I understand. Again. Courtney, I think we should break up. You're ready. I think we should break up. I think we should break up. I think we should break up. We don't want any. Okay, bye. Hold on, wait a second. I'm kidding. That was a joke. What can I do for you? Is Courtney home? Who's asking? I'm Gene. Oh, so you're the famous Gene. Come on in, famous Gene. Uh okay. Courtney! Hold on, I'm yell You got to yell up the stairs. She can't hear me. Gene's down here, Court! I'm taking my pill, Daddy. Tell him I'll be down in a second. Okay, she's taking her pill. She's gonna be down You probably heard that, didn't you? Follow me. Whoa! Where did you get all this stuff? Did your parents buy it for you? Yup, they did. You like that? Uh-huh. Go ahead. Go nuts. Why do you have all this? Are you Moby? No. I'm not Moby, but I am in the music business. I'm in the music business! Is that right? Well, I write jingles. Right now, I'm working on one for Pips potato chips.  Pop in a Pips-- Pop! potato chips  Crunch! That's beautiful. I've never met a real artist before.

Oh, you weak idiot! Louise, stop it. Seriously, Gene, what's wrong with you? Courtney's dad writes jingles. Remember Pawsage's Cat Sausages? Oh, yeah! I remember that.  Pawsages are pawsitively purrfect! Meow!  Ooh! That just made me hungry. God, Linda, just eat something. No! Courtney's having a birthday party this weekend, and great news-- I got us all on the list. Ooh! We're on the list! That's right, tummy. You're coming, too. What's that, tummy? No, you can't have ice cream. Count me out. Fine! Then you'll miss my performance. What performance? I'm gonna write a jingle and sing it at the party. When Doug hears it, he's gonna give me a record deal! A jingle deal. Her dad isn't gonna give you a record deal, Gene. Yes, he is! You can't keep going out with Courtney, just because of her dad. Yeah, you don't even like-like her. No, I think I might like-like her now. No, you don't. Nah, you don't, honey. Why don't you try speaking in words, instead of your damn dirty lies! Seriously! I think I do! When I shut my eyes and cover my ears, I feel like I maybe could spend the rest of my life with her. Aw I mean, ""oh."" Where's Gene? Oh, he's at Courtney's, hitting on her dad. Hey, Lin, can you check the burgers on the grill for me? I can't be around food right now, Bob. You do realize you work in a restaurant, right? Don't say restaurant; it makes me hungry. You okay, Linda? Mom's cranky because she's only had fruit and vegetable skins for three days. Is your name Linda? I don't think so! Whoa. I'm sorry, honey. Come here; I'm sorry. Come here. Come hug Mommy! Okay. Mommy hug. Mm! Did you use that cocoa butter shampoo? Yeah. Bu bu bu Butter butter Lin Lin What? What? Stop eating Tina's hair. Dad, I made up a jingle for you. You want to hear it? Not really.  Have a feast for your face  Have a burger at Bald Bob's!  It was pretty good, up until you said Bald Bob. Doug says when you write a jingle, use alliteration. Oh, thanks for the lesson, Professor Jingleberry. Good one. I've got one for you, too, Mort.  If you got yourself a stiff   Don't dump it in a ditch   Take your corpse to Mort!  That's me! That was really good. How about this one?  Told you to break up with Courtney   And you didn't listen  And now you're stuck with her forever   So suck it! That's not very catchy, but we'll work on it.  It's Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday  I feel light-headed. I'm not feeling anything. I think somebody stepped on this batch. Cake, anyone? Not for me, I'm on a diet. Bob! Bob! Take a piece of cake! I don't want cake. Just take a piece. I want to look at it, up-close. Fine. Oh, icing's like cake skin, right? What?! Lin, get ahold of yourself. Okay, I'm walking away from you now. So, Bob, I hear you're a burger man. Yep. Gene mentioned that you write jingles. You thinking what I'm thinking? I'm afraid to say yes.  Blazin' beef and big old buns   Bun, bun, bun, bun-bun, bun-bun   Bun, bun! Well, nice meeting you. Attention, everybody. Look at me! Birthday girl talking! Come on, everyone! They make a cute couple, huh? They certainly are standing next to each other. Mr. Belcher! I said attention! He talked first, so Well, he asked me a question. No I didn't. Well, you did, too. Um, okay, anyway, Gene's written a love jingle about me, and he's gonna perform it now. This is more of an extended jingle jam/demo reel. I call it ""Silent Love.""  When I close my eyes and I cover my ears   It's almost like you aren't here   It's a silent love-- shh!  Silent love! - Shh! - Silent love. No, seriously-- shh! Talkin' 'bout silent love! Stop singing! All the ladies in the house now: silent love! Silent love? Gene! I have to do the fellas in the house! You can't do the ladies and not do the fellas! Just be quiet! Let me sing! No! It's not a duet!  Silent love it's a silent  You are so annoying! What? Just stop singing! Stop talking! Stop breathing! Do you think I've ruined her birthday? Nah. You were right, Dad. I should've broken up with Courtney a long time ago. Now I've killed her. You didn't kill Courtney, Gene. Yeah, honey, she'll be okay. Probably. Look at the bright side: You'll never have to go out with any girls again, because they all hate you. They hate me, Doug hates me Lenny hates you. My career is ruined. Gene, Doug wasn't gonna give you a record deal. He doesn't even give out record deals. He doesn't have that power. Yes, he does! No, he doesn't. You don't know anything about the music business. Look, the doctor's coming over. Tina, are you still doing helium? No Tina! I like it. Give me some. Gene would you like to see her now? Uh, I'm good. Now's the time. Dad, what do I say to her? Just make light small talk. Yeah, cheer her up. Make some fart noises, huh? I don't think I have it in me. Oh! I do! There he is. Gene, is that you? Yes. P Put my necklace in my mouth? Did you really mean those things that you said? No! Well, a little bit. I'm sorry. So, you don't like-like me? No, but I like things about you. Like your dad and his stuff. You were using me. I prefer the term ""networking."" Gene, if you're gonna break up with me, break up with me. I can take it. Courtney, I think we should break up. Oh, my God! Courtney! Doctor, do something! There's nothing we can do. You broke her heart. Psych! Way to go, Courtney. You're okay? Yeah. Did you fake this whole thing? No. The palpitations were real, but we stabilized her. Thanks, Dr. Chegler. Oh, you're welcome. You should've seen your face. Did you see his face? It was very funny. You scared me! I think you kind of deserved it, after what you did to me. I guess you're right. It's okay. I'll forgive you. If you get Peter Pescadero to go out with me. Peter's got partial hearing loss. It's a perfect match. And if you clean my bedpan. Fair enough. Doug, can I still visit you in gear heaven? Nope. Not a chance in gear hell, Gene. Okeydokey. What the hell? I didn't lose a thing! You're wearing clothes; that adds a little weight. You're right. Oh, he's so smart. Yeah. Lin, no no, no Linda, stop. Lin, you can't take off your clothes here! Bob, I need an accurate number! Lin, this diet is making you crazy. Just take it off You don't even need to be on it. You look great. What about my muffin top? You know who doesn't have a muffin top? People who go to the gym all the time, and who don't have kids. Don't blame us, fatty! Lookin' good! Aw! Horny little grandpa. Thanks, horny little grandpa! Well, I learned my lesson. Never date someone you don't like-like. Even if it means losing out on a record deal. That's my boy. Gene, why are you holding a bedpan? The doctor said I could have it. I'm never using a toilet again! Ooh, mashed potatoes. Lin, where are you going? Hey, come back here! Oh, yeah, now I see her muffin top. Give me that!  When I close my eyes and I cover my ears  Hmm?  It's almost like you aren't here   It's Silent Muffler-- shh! That's my song! That's my song! Doug! ***"
"Fa-la, la-la, fa-la, la-la   La-la-la-la-la  I saw three kids come sailing through   On seven days before Christmas in the morning.  Why are you putting up ninja throwing stars? I think they're doilies. They're snowflakes! They're Christmas-y. Ninja snowflakes! Hi-yah! Ha! Yah! Ow. Ow. Gene. Speaking of Christmas, here's my annual list of demands. ""My own apartment."" And it cannot be a studio. You have exactly seven shopping days to comply. If it rolls into day eight, there will be tears and violence. I want a dry erase board. So I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. I want the actual Olympic bobsled used in Cool Runnings. We can't afford any of those things, kids. Not even a dry erase board? No, Tina! Sorry. Been a tough year, ever since the City Guide listed us as a gas station. Hey, a bunch of presents don't matter. Christmas isn't all about getting stuff. Yes, it is! Take it back! Take it back! Merry Christmas, Mike! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas to you. Hi, Mike. Hi, Bob. Here's your mail. Thanks. Ahem. What? Ahem! Oh. Right. Of course. You know, I never know how much to tip the mailman. No, you don't. Um, you know what, here. Uh, I am going to write a number on this piece of paper. There you go. Oh, yeah, that's about right-- if I delivered mail one day a week. Fine. Here's more than that. Oh, thanks, Bob. Hey, I got something special for you, too. Special delivery. Were you not gonna give me this if I didn't tip you? No, I-I would have. Just not today. Maybe it's from Santa. It's from the law firm of Bankoff, Bostwick & Biel. Santa's suing us! Hey, it says I've been named an heir in the enclosed will of Ernest G. Lombard. Aw! Uncle Ernie's dead? But it's Christmas. Huh, I haven't talked to Uncle Ernie in years. ""Talking to Uncle Ernie"" would be great code for going a poop. James, he just died. It's a fitting tribute. Excuse me, who is *** this guy? He was my mother's brother. He owned Lombard's Department Store before the mall came and put it out of business. How much did Uncle Ernie leave you? Well, let's see what it say-- Hey! Hey! A- ba-ba-ba! Don't look! Let's have a reading of the will. I'll make punch. You always want to make punch. Ever heard of eggnog? I have all those sample punch packets. Ah, look, I got-- just got another one. I'm so excited! I have to go talk to Uncle Ernie! Okay, everyone has their punch, so it's time to inherit the wind! Oh, mmm. Ooh, it's good. No, it's not. Let's make a pact that we won't let the money change us. Uncle Ernie's worst Christmas is going to be our best Christmas! Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Jamaican bobsled! Apartment! Dry erase board. Uh, like that. Let's just say this Christmas might not be terrible. Ahem! You have been bequeathed Drumroll! storage unit 39 at the Quincy Avenue Just-Stow-It. Oh. Ugh. I still have a good feeling about this. There could be an old car in there. Or a whole bunch of fur coats. Ooh. I'm gonna throw paint on them! Remember, if it's something really good, we'll have to pay taxes on it. Huh? Oh, hey. We won a caveman! Who are you? My name's Chet. Uh, short for Chester, long for Ch. That's my little joke. Did you, did you enjoy the joke? Yes. Eh. I'm Tina. Shoes on or off? On, please. Can I get you something to drink? Cough syrup? Rainwater? Not that. That's urine. Why are you living in my uncle's storage unit? Mr. Lombard is your uncle? Yeah, he left me this unit in his will. Oh. Mr. Lombard's dead? Yeah. You want to come in for a hug? Um, no. Why? 'Cause we just met? Yeah, I guess. That's better. May I join you two? No. So, how'd you know Uncle Ernie? I did window displays at his store for 20 years. When the store closed, he let me stay in here. Don't you have a family or friends to stay with? You know, with Christmas coming and all that. Wait, it's Christmas? My calendar says it's, uh, da-da-da August. Bobby, tell him he can stay in our basement. ; What? Why? Because, 'tis the season! Of what? Taking strange men into our basement? Of being nice, Bobby. He's fine right here. He's got a TV and a jar. You guys are loud whisperers. Sorry. So, you're taking over the lease? It's 150 a month. Oh. Thanks again for letting me stay here. Yeah, Bobby, you old softie. You're like a mushy snowman. A lot of space! I can't wait until the carpeting comes in. Is your heart set on this wall color? 'Cause I have some ideas. But just to be clear, Chet, you're only here till right after Christmas. This Christmas? Um, yeah. The one that's coming up in a week. This is the nicest thing anybody's ever done for me. Including when Sal over there gave me this track suit. If you want to give Sal something, he needs a penis. Fire! What?! Just kidding. Come look. What? Come on. What? What happened? Ah! Chet's gone. His pee jar is cold. I got to say, I'm relieved. There was something off about that guy. And he smelled Oh, oh! It's Chet! Oh. Hey, Chet. There's my guy. What do you think of the display? Is it holi-doing it for you? You did all this? Oh, it's amazing! You gave me a place to stay, I give you: Class under Glass, by Chet. So you don't just design the displays, you're also in them? Of course. Why wouldn't I be? Well, it's a nice display. Um, thanks for doing it. How long did it take? Chet? Chet? He's being weird again. It's been two hours and he still hasn't moved. Come on! I'm tired of pantsing him. It's like pantsing a stone. Or Grandpa. I love your display. The hats are fabulous. How much are they? Uh, we don't sell hats. We sell burgers. We still need to find a hat and something for the mailman. Please tell me you sell gift certificates. I, uh, I have a napkin and a pen, so I can write one. You know, Chet may be a strange guy, but his display really upped our foot traffic. Okay, Chet. We're closed. You can move now. Whew! Ah! I am full of lactic acid and ideas for tomorrow's window! Ah! You're gonna do a different one tomorrow? Tomorrow and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day and then it's Christmas, so I'll stop. Can we help? I want to be a Gene-equin! I'll be a Tina-quin. Let me print up some real gift certificates. And maybe, uh, cover the window with a big curtain, and unveil the new display right before we open. That's very theatrical. Are you gay? We wish. Okay. Anything jumping out at you for tomorrow's display? I found a train! The most civilized form of toy travel. This would look good in my new apartment. It was a joke at first, but now I'm starting to expect it. This is fun, teaming up, you know? I used to do windows with my wife, Nadine. Oh, you're married? We're separated. It's okay. What's past is past. Let's just, uh, focus on tomorrow's window. Moving on! Yeah, your new family doesn't want to hear about your old family.  When I was small, I believed in Santa Claus   Though I knew it was my dad  And I would hang up my stalking at Christmas   Open my presents and I'd be glad   Father Christmas, give us some money  One local man has gone from homeless to ""homeful"" here in the window of Bob's Burgers, where you could say he's been making quite a living display of himself. Hey, look, I can see me! Look, I'm waving! Wow, this is great for us. We're on the news. The restaurant Gene, stop licking yourself. You're on TV. Where I belong! So, Bob, what's it gonna be for the big Christmas Eve finale? I don't know what the last display's gonna be. Chet's the idea guy. Let's hear your idea, Chet. No, no, no! Don't tell me! Don't ruin it. No, you got to tell me, you I can't handle it. No, no, no, no, no! Don't tell me. Don't tell me. Guy's fun to talk to. Whatever it is, it better be good. Mort's mom is coming to see it. She's got cataracts, so make it big. It's not here yet, but I want to go on record and say this is the best Christmas ever! Whoa! I know. We might actually be able to afford to buy the kids something nice. And maybe I can sneak out later while you cover for me. Yeah, I'll tell the kids you're dropping off a present for your mistress. As if. Why are you wrapping the TV remote? It's my Christmas present to Dad. He loves this thing. Great idea. I'll wrap Mom's glasses. Hey, what you looking at, Chet? I'm just zoning out. This was Nadine's favorite Christmas song. Oh, who's Nadine?  Silent night Oh.  Holy night Who's Nadine? She's Chet's ex-wife. He's missing her pretty bad. How could you not miss her? Oh, she's gorgeous! Wait, is she? Whoo. She looks nice. Yeah, perfect posture. And wooden boobs. Chet, this is a mannequin. Back when Nadine and I got married, I was a mannequin, too. Oh, now I understand. You think you were a mannequin? Oh, it's okay. You don't need to be scared of me. I'm not one of those murder mannequins or satanic mannequins. I'm just a store mannequin that came to life. So happy you're staying with us in our basement.  Sleep in heavenly  Okay, everybody out. Chet's crazy, Lin. Do you think he'll kill us before or after Christmas? I don't think he will. He said he's not a murder mannequin. You two really have to work on your whispering. So, if you're a mannequin, you won't feel this! That hurt! I didn't say I am a mannequin. I said I was a mannequin. I get it. One day, all of a sudden, you're anatomically correct. I just went through that. Well, I'm pretty sure mannequins don't turn into people, except in that one movie. This was no movie. This was retail. The new summer sportswear had just come in, and so had Nadine. She didn't have nipples, and, brother, she didn't need them. As summer turned to fall casuals, our relationship became anything but. Casual? Yes, casual. That winter, I took Nadine skiing. There was a terrible accident. Nadine shattered her right hand. Oh, God. When she came back to the store with two left hands, I knew I had to make a decision. Which hand to replace with a hook? No.Which one to put the ring on. Boo. Oh, God, Lin, are you crying? You know I love weddings. We were going to be together forever. Then came - the mall. - Damn that mall! Lombard's had an everything-must-go sale, and my everything went. I never saw her again. Wait, why didn't she need nipples? I was so heartbroken. The pain must have turned me human, so I could feel pain. This is the greatest love story ever told. Look, Chet, there's no way any of that could be true. Well then, if I wasn't a mannequin, how come I don't know how to use a computer? Explain that, Bob. Yeah, Dad, explain that. Don't give up, Chet. Maybe Nadine's still out there. You could find her. Hmm. Well, with a face like that, I assume she's modeling in Paris or Milan. We could help, even if it means going to Paris or Milan. Right. I bet she's in Kosovo. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No one's helping Chet look for a mannequin who may or may not exist. She existed! Fine, she existed. And you were in love with her. But you were never a mannequin, Chet. Just move on. Nadine is probably in a dump somewhere. Oh, God! Kids, bed-- now. I want to talk to your father. No, kids, stay. Please stay. Go. Go! Stay. Stay! You go! Gene, stay! Now! Tina, don't move! You go! Louise, stay! Get out of here! Don't leave me! You get out of here! How could you say that in front of that poor Chet? Poor Chet? Poor us, stuck with poor Chet. Bobby, you made him cry. He's unstable, Lin. I'm sure lots of things make him cry. Oh, I'm so mad I could stomp, Do it, Mom! Do the stompy dance! She's doing it! Don't bother bringing the mistletoe to bed! But do bring me a snack. Chocolate! Mom, Dad, get up. What? What happened? You have to see Chet's window. Oh! Oh, my God. What the hell is it? - He's gone murder-mannequin. - No. It's the display window of my soul, Bob. This is a warning. Don't love or believe or hope in anything. Message received. I like this area. Dig deeper. People are coming to see this. Our window was on TV and in the newspaper's Christmas Countdown. You have to change it. Make it happy. My happy is gone! It's in the dump somewhere. I hope your face can catch, Bob, because I'm throwing your words back in it. Nice job, Bobby. Way to go. We have to find Nadine. Don't worry. Gene-equin knows how a mannequin thinks. Ah, a traditional Christmas mannequin hunt. Show us the window! Yeah! Show us the window! Now! We found Nadine! We found her! Oh, it's a Christmas miracle. I told you kids not to go looking for her-- I mean, it. You also told me to not surprise you when you're peeing, but you know you love it. Stick 'em up! Aah! Aw, Chet's going to be reunited with his long-lost love. Can't get that at a store. Where'd you find her? At a store. Oh. I'm gonna break it! I'm gonna break it! Oh, crap. What are we going to do? You're going to go get Nadine. That's what you're going to do, Old St. Dick. Then Chet will have his lady love, and maybe he'll help you give those people their display. Hmm, that could work. Go! Use the back door. I'll stall the crowd. Go, go. - Show us the window! - Yeah! Show us the window! Now! Show us the win ""A Christmas Poem"" by Linda Belcher. Christmas, Christmas.

All right, you guys stay out here. She's mine. I found her at the dump. Finders keepers. Okay, fine. But, um, could I could I borrow her just till the end of the day? Are you kidding me? She pulls them in. And there's only one sex shopping day till Christmas. It's my biggest day. There's nobody here. Oh, no, no, no, there's other people. They're in the back part.

And we only dropped her twice. You-youyou found her? Yes, she's right here. Oh, my God, that's Wait a minute. I don't I'm not sure I want her to see me like this. This track suit is 12 seasons old, I've got a gut Oh, don't worry. Nadine's changed, too. Yeah, come out, Chet, please. It-it she really misses you. I don't know. What about all the stuff you said about how I was never a mannequin? Bob Look, um, I'm sorry I said that. I I do think you need help. But before you get help, we need help. So you still don't believe me. Um, no, but all that matters is you're a man now, in love with the mannequin who I'm holding by the arm but should be in yours. Wow. I got to say that really hit me. Okay, so open the door. Tough times, huh, Baby? Well, I don't care what you had to do. I missed you. I've changed? Well Yeah, I like your hair that way. It's Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, yeah. Well, I was Uh-huh. Right. Chet's a really good listener. That's important to a woman. Lin, she's a mannequin. Who won't shut up, apparently. Hey, uh, guys, sorry to interrupt. Did, uh did Nadine say anything about getting that window display going? 'Cause we we really need to finish strong here. What do you think, Nadine? Yes. What? What is what is she saying? She's cracking one of her spoofs. What's a spoof? Just one of her goof-abouts. You mean like a joke or? Nadine, you still got it. Yeah, she wants to do it. That's great. What was the joke? Trust me, you won't get it. And remember, look alive but absolutely still. And no action! Uh, thanks for waiting, everyone. I now give you Christmas! It was worth it. Mort, I want to take a picture. Fix the wig. No, your mom's. Okay, who needs a gift certificate? Thief! You stole my girl. I want her back! Oh, no. Hand her over. Sorry. She's with me now. We'll see about that. Okay, easy.

You're lucky I don't call the cops on you pervs. Can't we just buy her from you, please? She's not for sale. Every sex shop owner has his price. Five grand. What? No. What about two hundred and sixty-one, two, three dollars? No, Louise, that's the money we were going to use to buy you kids presents. Okay, that is not enough for an apartment. You can spend my gift money on Nadine. Oh, your dry erase board. You can use my money, too. Oh, your Jamaican bobsled. Fine. I'm in. But I better get a heck of a Presidents Day gift. Seriously? You're all willing to give up your Christmas presents for Chet? Aw. What the hell? Give me the money. Well, here you go, Chet. Thanks, Bob. Sorry we busted up your display. Mm-hmm. After everything you did for me. Roof over my head, Nadine back in my arms. All right, you know what? You don't need to be out by tomorrow. Really, Bobby? You mean it? Yeah, stay till New Year's. Aw.

Kiss her. Mmm. Ugh. No! Oh, God. Pick it up, Chet. Five-second rule. Oh, are you as hot as I am right now? Whoa. Are you hot? I'm fine. Never mind. I think they love it. Oh, my God, it's happening. The kiss is turning her human. No, wait, it's turning him back into a mannequin. No, wait, nothing's happening. They went too far. I'm out of here. Merry Christmas, Teddy. Happy holidays, Mort.

Unless you become a hooker. Welcome, everyone. Welcome to my mother/daughter seminar Modo Time. I'm Dakota. You're the Phenomimom? But you're a man. I am a man. And that's okay. The female spirit flows through all of us. We're all estro-geniuses. Everybody stand up and say it, ""I am an estro-genius."" I am an estro-genius. Oh, dear. Guys, today we are going back. We're gonna go all the way back to the womb. We're gonna get into a womb-a-tism! A what? A womb-a-tism! Ooh, a what? No. Hi. Sorry we're late. Ooh, a male daughter. Ha-ha, Logan. Oh, God, it's here. Sorry, this was the only seminar available, and we had an incident yesterday. Logan called me the ""B"" word. Why must that word exist? Question. What's the ""uter-room?"" Well, I'm hoping what's in that room won't be necessary. Now, let Modo Time begin! Dad, I want you to drop everything you're doing and shave my legs. I'll take care of the first part. Gene. I was trying to help. Uh, Tina, can't you just shave them yourself? I tried. - Oh, God! - Aah! Oh, oh, dear. Oh oh, my aah! No more razors for you. Just wait for Mom. You wait for Mom. If I don't shave this before school tomorrow, Claire and Jacqueline might talk about me at some restaurant. All right, fine. Like a seafood restaurant or a Chinese restaurant. Tina. Or that rain forest restaurant with all the jungle sounds. Or McCormick and Schmidt's. I said I'll do it. Oh, okay, thanks. There was a time when you got all you needed from your mother through a single cord. Mothers, please strap your symbolic umbilical cords to your daughters' faces. I call them ""umbilitators."" That's not how umbilical cords work. Here we go wee-ooh! It doesn't make any sense. And feed those fetuses. Down the hatch. Louise, open your mouth. Louise, open your mouth. Uh-uh. Yeah, she's fine. We're fine. Yes, open that fetus mouth! Oh, it's fun. - Money. - What? Money, no no more extorting me. Mm-hmm. Okay, fine. Five bucks now, swallow. Mmm, oh, she loves it. Aw. Oh, hello. You must be here for our back waxing special. Um, no. Arm waxing? No. Scrotal waxing? No what? No! Yeah, that one. No, no, not that one. Yes. Gene, stop. You need it. Gene, shut up. My daughter needs to get her legs waxed. Hi. Oh. Phew. I mean, not that I don't want to wax you but no, I have my limits. Okay, well, you don't have to be rude. Why don't we just take you in the back, sweetheart? It's your job, you know. I'd wax you, Dad. Thanks, Gene. Time to be born. This is disgusting. You sound just like your father. Louise, come to Mama. Oh, no, I think I'm good, thank you. Can I get some scissors, Dakota? Do a little C-section? Those vagisacks cost $50, so no. Speaking of money. Here. Someone's dilating. There she is. And time to swaddle the baby. No, no, no, no, no, no, no oh, God. Snug it up, now, snug it up. No. I shaved that part. You must have been very determined. Thank you. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put the hot wax on your legs. Uh-huh. And then we put these strips on your legs and pull them off. - Uh-huh. - And it kind of hurts. Uh-huh-ah. - A lot. - Dad! I don't know if I can do this. Dad, you have to do it with me. What? No, no way. Yes, it's like when you got that flu shot to show me it was okay. Yeah, that was brave of me, but Please? I know I act tough, but I'm not. Oh, my God the crying. Okay, I'll do it. Yay, scrotal wax. No, Gene, not scrotal, just leg. Oh, boo! Okay, everybody, role reversal. Louise, you're Linda now. And you're trying to get your defiant daughter Louise to clean her room. Action. Role play's gonna cost you big. I'll pay for it when I see it. Hello. I'm Linda.  And I want you to clean your room   So I'm singing this song.   But I'm not gonna clean my room, la-la la-la la-la.  No-no-no-no. No singing. Wha? I'm doing you. That's why I'm singing. You're doing me, so you don't sing. Oh, like I'm not gonna sing!  Oh, you better clean your room   I will never clean my room   'Cause I'm singing this song   'Cause I'm so rebellious!   And you're gonna clean your room!   No, I'm not gonna stop!  Okay, you two are done. Big hand for Linda and Louise. Please sit down. Great. You blew it. I blew it? You gave me nothing out there! Well, nothing is what you're getting paid for that! Whoa. Time out. Linda, have you been paying your daughter to be here? I'm sorry, Dakota, but it's the only way she'd do it. I'm a terrible mother. Oh, Linda, you really, really are. Everybody, everybody, listen, okay? Linda is a good mother. Mwa. Because she did it out of love. And that puts you in the running for the Most Valuable Mommy award the MVM, everybody which I give out at the end of the day. - All right! - MVM! Pshh And as for you, I don't feel like you're taking Modo Time seriously. Oh, no, not at all. And that makes me feel negatively towards you. Well, maybe this will help clear things up. Here's your seminar. See it? It's so cute and nice in my hand, and Did you just fart on my seminar? Ye, me, too! Okay, that's that's fine. I think I know what we need to do here. Hey! Watch it! Get off me! You two will stay in there until you're ready to engage in this experience! Oh, almost forgot. Oh, God. What is that? It's Freaky Friday on a loop. Mom, you're old. And you're young! Wouldn't it be crazy if we switched bodies? No! No! Oh-hoo-hoo! Oh, no, we switched bodies! What a crazy journey we are on. The logic of this movie is very unsettling! You can't do this, you monsters! All right, well, why don't you two pair up now that your children are locked away? Of course, Dakota. Come on, Cynthia. Let's you and me learn some mommy skills together. I'd like that, Linda. And don't forget about that Most Valuable Mommy award, everybody. It's a beautiful sash. - Huh. Huh. - Hmm. - Hmm. - Ah. I want that sash. Over my dead body. I want that sash. I love sashes. My legs are so free. Mmm. So that's what air feels like. It's nice. Yeah, these pants feel incredible. Why don't all men do this? Hmph! Gene, why are you making noises? They're my jealousy noises! Ugh! What are you saying? I want to wax my legs, too! These ones right here! You don't even have leg hair. Tell that to my heart! Hold on, everybody. We're making a U-turn. All right! Ow! Gentle touch, Cynthia. A mother's gentle touch. I'm so sorry. You know, Dakota, when I braid Louise's hair, I sing her a song. Ah, yes, please.  Here goes the hair and there goes the hair  Ah  And where is Harry Truman?  He's dead in the ground, he's dead in the ground   He's dead, dead, dead  Ow! Ow! Well we switched bodies again, and everything's back to normal. I finally understand you, Mom. Freaky Friday's getting to me, man. They really understand each other! You pull yourself together. We got to get out of here. They just had to see things from each other's perspective. Logan, come on! We got to think! Walk a mile in each other's shoes Oh, I swear to God, if you keep talking, I'm gonna gut-punch you! It's a beautiful story of love and acceptance. Oh, my stomach! Wait a minute. That's it! Wow. See? What'd I tell you? That is smooth. Whoa, whoa, Teddy. What, a little high up on the leg? - Yeah. - Sorry. There's a stop sign right here. Now feel mine. And mine. No, Teddy, don't touch their legs. Look at this. Whoa! You could wash a pan with that. Hey, maybe I'll shoot over there and get what you got. Yeah. Nah, on second thought, I couldn't get rid of these little guys. They're my little furry friends. Don't listen to him. You're an embarrassment! No, don't listen to him. You're all right. Furry little friends? This is fun! Higher, Tina! Higher! Watch out for that bear! Whoo! Here comes a puma! - Mommy! Mommy! - Mommy! Did you hear that, everybody? They're coming around. The Uter-Room is working! Oh, that umbilical soup got me, Mom. Got me real bad. Rub my tummy? Mine, too. Oh, my poor baby. It's wonderful. A mother's instinct at its most primal level! Come, other mothers, come and see! Mommy's gonna make you all better. Well, this mommy's gonna make you all better first. Now! Ha! What the hell's going on? Uh, what are what are you doing? You fell for the oldest trick in the book. The fake tummy ache! The old belly bluff. Oh, the belly bluff! Now, if you'll excuse us, us girls Sorry. Ladies Thank you. Are going to play laser tag. Whoo-hoo! Oh, I hope those lasers hit you right in the butt! Come on, you! Damn these delicate shoulders! Let me try. Where'd you learn how to break down a door, Girl Scout camp? Move it. No covering your sensors. No climbing on the barriers. And no physical contact of any kind. Well, agree to disagree. I feel kind of bad about locking our moms in that room. Ah, hey! I killed them. I killed them all. Tina, what what's wrong? I killed my friendly leg hairs. Um oh. Well, they'll grow back. It's not just that. I did it 'cause I was worried about what those girls would think of me. I'm a sheep! A hairless sheep! So you gave in to peer pressure. It happens to everybody. I mean, why do you think I wear these shoes? 'Cause you don't care what you look like? What? No. 'Cause I No. 'Cause I saw some other chefs wearing them and I thought they were cool. Don't you think? Yeah, yeah. What do you mean? I think they're Yeah, they're cool. Um okay. Well, because if they don't look if they look stupid, I won't wear them. No, they Yeah. Forget it. Listen. Leg hair or no leg hair, you're still Tina, and when it comes to the important stuff, you'll make the right choice. Gene, put some pants on. - No! - Ugh. What the hell? How'd you get out? I busted through the door. Um, we busted through the door. Fine. My shoulder and Cynthia's left boob. All right, everybody. Fun's over. Now, let's get back on Modo Time. Oh, no freaking way! You are coming back to the Nurture Center right now! You're in big trouble, Logan Berry Bush. Huh? Logan Berry Bush? We didn't think it through. Okay, everybody, calm down. Now, how do we get down there? No one goes in without a vest and a laser gun. Well, that's not happening. I'll go down there! Linda, no! Laser tag goes against everything we've been working on. And besides you're mothers. Uh-huh. Where's mommy's gun?! So, welcome to the war. Okay, first, uh let's just try to create a dialogue, and we'll You're gonna get it, Miss Missy! Why don't you let your gun do the talking, blabbermouth! Blabbermouth? Linda, this isn't right! Feels pretty good to me! I am ordering you to put down your gun and go cradle your daughter! No! I'm gonna shoot her instead! Ha! Gotcha! I gave you that one! Nah! This is seriously hurting your chances of receiving the MVM award! Maybe I should give the sash to Cynthia, huh? Die, Logan! Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa, seriously? I'm the MVM? What?! The sash! Oh! That's for kidnapping me! Ooh! Aah! And that's for taking me to The Momgina Monologues! You almost killed your mother. I hope you're happy. I am. Any last words? Yes. I just wish I just wish you liked me, that's all. But I guess you never will, so go ahead, put me out of my misery. Is this all 'cause you think I don't like you? Go on. Just do it. Just go. Take me out. Go ahead. Mom, I guess I've been kind of a ""B"" word today. You have. But I came on a little strong.

Come on. Scratch like a man! Give it to me! Tina, I'm sorry I wasn't there to give you your first shave. It's okay. I regretted it anyway. But it was fun going to the waxing salon with Dad. He's a screamer. Ow, Gene! Not so hard! Aw, man! Your day sounds better. What? I want to go shave my legs with Dad and then regret it. Yeah, let's make all the same mistakes with Dad again tomorrow! Okay. Yay, Dad. Oh, screw all of you. Ah, Mom. Come here."
"Will the burger be hot enough? Hot enough to kill the deadly bacteria? Or is it so cool that I will shut you down? One sixty-three, one sixty-four One sixty-five. Hot patty. It's safe. Damn it! - Yay! - Yay! Grade-A ground beef. Meaning we dropped it on the ground. Louise. Are we done here, Hugo? Almost. There's just the little matter of your handwashing certification. I don't see it prominently displayed anywhere. Come on, nobody needs to be certified in handwashing. Yeah! Hands off my hands, government! If you wish to remain open, you will attend a one day seminar exploring the 32 steps of proper hand sanitation. I'm not taking that seminar. Not before you watch - the introductory DVD, you're not. - Ugh. - Come on, Hugo. - And here's your ""C"" rating. Which will remain in your window until you graduate. What?! Hugo, you're an awful man. Uh, wrong, Bob. I'm a ""lawful"" man. Falafel man. - Waffle man. - Omelettes. Am I doing it right? We should get going, Hugo. Who're you going to harass next, guys? Well, Bob, if you must know, perhaps you've heard our town is now home to a disgusting nude beach? There've been reports of vendors there serving food while n-n naked. That's how the vendors served food in the Bible. - Don't drag religion into this. - Sorry. So long, Bob. Get certified or that ""C"" will stand for ""closed."" Hi. I'm Andre Royo. I played Bubbles on the critically acclaimed series The Wire. Today I'm here to talk about a different kind of bubbles. Soap bubbles. Remember: When washing your hands, do it for the time it takes to count to a thousand. One two three four Bobby, when are you and me gonna go to that nude beach that Hugo was talking about? Ugh. Nude beaches are full of overweight, out-of-shape old bodies and I don't want to go there and realize I look exactly like that. I'll go with you, Mom. Mother-daughter nudity day. Fun! I'm pretty sure it's no kids allowed. No kids allowed? Hmm Look through here and tell me what you see. It's a cliff. My turn! That's a cliff, all right. Tina, you nailed it! No, it's a cliff that overlooks the nude beach. And if we figure out how to get up there, we could sell tours nudity tours to teenage boys. It's like the Internet, but outside. Yes! Hey, whoa, God! We're not even at the nude beach yet, you. Guess my boobs didn't get the memo. Ha! It's like we're in Paris. - I love it. - I know. C'est la vie. Let's go! Whoo! Keep hacking! Come on, guys, we're gonna be the Lewis and Clark of nudism! I'll be the Sacajawea. Of sacks! This is fun! You already took your bottoms off! Whoa, whoa! What kind of shape is that? I don't know, it started out to be a triangle, but then I had to do it myself, and then, I don't know it's like a flower or something. Whoa. Check out the hot guys in the drum circle. Hi. Hey, that looks like Oh, my God! Bobby, you're not gonna believe this. He was at the nude beach! Wait, who was there? Hugo! Yeah, he was trying to shut the place down. No, he's one of them now. One of what? A nudist! Nudie! He was playing in the waves. Dancing around. He looked like, ah Madonna in the ""Cherish"" video. Th-that's not possible. He said he took a leave of absence to be nude. So Hugo's not our health inspector anymore? Do you know what this means? We're free! Ah! Oh, oh! No more surprise inspections! Ha, ha! No more stupid violations! And I am not going to the handwashing class! Filth! I wash my hands. Unbelievable. Hugo the health inspector is a nudist! I know, can you believe it? Gretchen and I spotted him from across the sands Out with the bad air, in with the nude air. Don't be embarrassed, Linda. Yes, we were once an item, and true, we never saw each other nude back then unfortunately but better late than never. What happened? I thought you were gonna shut this place down. Oh, my investigation? Let's just say what I uncovered in that investigation was my very own soul. Wow. The old Hugo would have seen this man as a health hazard, pure and simple. The new Hugo sees only a man. A nude man selling blondies. Three blondies, please. Whoa, wai Wha Where'd you pull that from? My fanny pack. Where's your fanny pack? Oop. Oh-ho! There it is. Well, it kind of makes sense. I mean, the guy was wound so tight he was like a tubby little time bomb. Teletubby time bomb. Kids! Come in here! I have amazing news. Can't it wait? We're tired. And rashy. Where were you? Bushwacking a trail to the nude overlook. Dad, before you say anything, know that we're gonna come out of this deal stinkin' rich! And we're gonna put a roof over you and Ma. Well, good luck. I'd pay not to have to look at those people. Hey, Dad, whoa, whoa, whoa, rewind. I'd like to hear your amazing news. Everyone, Hugo is not a health inspector anymore. He's a nudist! Ron! I think I know why you're here. Go ahead, I'll pretend I haven't heard. It's true. Hugo has taken a leave of absence. We miss him terribly and hope for his speedy return. Ha-ha! Right. All right, well, I'd like you to meet Hugo's replacement. Hey, hello, Tommy Jaronda. Pleasure to meet you. Hi. Uh what, you're the new Hugo? Well, there's only one Hugo. Yeah, well, I'm here, so let's get into it. Oh, um listen, Inspector, uh, Jaronda, I know you're just doing your job, but we got inspected two days ago, so Yeah, yeah, it's cool, Bob. Yeah, yeah, you know what? Call me Tommy. Okay, Tommy. All right. I'm seeing a lot of tickytacky fouls here. What, he made you go to a handwashing seminar? That's some major B.S. Pardon my language, kids. How are you? Hello. No sweat off our ass. Yeah, that Hugo, he kind of had it out for us. Ugh. I-I can't stand inspectors like that. You know? Makes us look like turds. ""No one can make you look like a turd without your permission."" Eleanor Roosevelt. Ha! This kid's a trip! Funny stuff, funny stuff. You know what? I'm actually, uh I'm starving. You hungry, Ron-Ton? You mean eat one of Bob's burgers? Hugo would never Oh, come on, Ron. This guy How tall is this guy? He's pretty tall. The leaning tower of ta of tall guy. I'm giving you a hard time, come here. Hey, Bob, can you grill us up a couple? Um is this part of the inspection? Uh, yeah, something I like to call the mouth inspection. Okay. Whoa! This is incredible! Wow, first time I ever got a compliment from a health inspector. Bob, question: You like rock? Um, yeah. I like rock music. Is that what you're talking about? - Yes. - Okay. You know, I play almost every night over at Pistol McSwish's Basketball and Brew. You should come by. Th-That'd be great. Absolutely. What your burger did to my mouth, my music is gonna do to your ears. That's great Come here, come here. All right, all right. Get out of here, man. What are you doing? Yeah, come here. Oh. You got me. What, you punching me? I'm punching you back. I think Dad just got to second base with that guy. What are you doing this weekend, brother? I would like to visit the nude beach and see the naked people. You only live once, right, my sister? Haven't you heard? Kids aren't allowed on the nude beach. No! Unfair, isn't it? Well, what if I told you that you could see the nude beach? Mm! All the dingles Ooh. All the dongles Ahh. All for one low price. I want to see the dongles! Hell, yeah! Cocoa-buttered boobies! Sign up here to see the buff from the bluff! Don't be shy they certainly aren't. Hello, Louise. Darryl, you interested? You strike me as more of an indoor nerd. I am interested, but not as a customer as a key member of your team. For a piece of the action? Oh-ho-ho, is that so? It is so. If you're nudie watching from the top of a bluff, I've got something that'll double your money. Basically, this is the Hubble for boobies. I've seen my neighbor across the street put her bra and girdle on hundreds of times. Aren't girdles for old people? They are. And she is. Nice. How come we're doing all the lugging? You're also doing all the yapping. Nudes, ho! Starting tomorrow, we're gonna be flush with ass-cash. Whatcha doin', Pops? Hitting the streets for some hooch? No, he's off to Pistol McSwish's to see the new health inspector play his rock. I have to go. We want to keep this guy on our side. Tommy! I was just heading out to catch your set Bob! You're never gonna believe it! That idiot who owns Pistol McSwish's told me I can't play there anymore! What? How come? 'Cause he don't know nothin' about good rock, that's how come. Aw. Wait Hey, I could play here. Here? Uh, what? Yeah. - Nah. - Yeah, no. The acoustics in here are not No. The acoustics in here are great. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds good in here. Oh, clapping. Clapping's fun. Echo. Echo. Stop. Stop. Echo. Echo. Gene, stop. Gene. Ah! Ah! Oh, it's done. I'm grabbing my amp. Maybe it won't be so bad.  I'm a bad man with a master plan   And the ladies call me Tex  And the one thing all the ladies know is   I'm good at having  Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex   I leave my shirt on, that's okay   Don't make me feel self-conscious, babe   Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, when you're done, say that was fun   We might've made a little son, I'm good at sex   You're bad at sex, I'm good at sex, you're bad at sex   I'm good at sex, you're bad at sex   I'm good at sex, you're bad at sex, I'm good at sex  Oh, my God. Tommy's music is terrible. He's driving out all the customers. You told him he could play here all week? I don't think I did. I did. But this is still way better than dealing with Hugo. You got to say something. What about that song, ""Elderly Prostitute""?  Da, da, da, da, da, elderly prostitute   Da, da, da, boo, ba, elderly prostitute  All right, I'll say something. So, what'd you guys think? Did you like my rock? D'oh. Tommy, that, uh rocked. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Linda, what'd you think? Ha! Did it speak to you as a lady? Now be honest. It screamed in my face as a lady. Oh, Mom loved it. Sell her a CD. Done. Yeah, listen, Tommy, can I talk to you about something I Come on, let's go backstage. Let's go. What? Oh. Okay. Hmm! WhooMan. What people don't know about rock, it's a very physical experience, you know? It's-it's very athletic. You're moving around a lot. Yeah, yeah. You noticed that. It's almost like you moved around too much. Yeah, I've gotten all kinds of comments, you know ""you move around a lot,"" ""you seem to be having a hard time."" Yeah, I can see that one, a little bit. ""You're jumping around for no reason."" Right. ""You know, your eyes are bulging weird. It's off-putting,"" this and that but that's what they said about Queen. Yeah. Did they? Uh, in rock in general. Hey, uh, Tommy, uh you know, our place is sort of a family restaurant and some of your songs are a little risquÃ©. So I was thinking, maybe don't Wait. Hold on a second. Before I forget, I got a little something here for you it's your inspection file. There's nothing on here. That's right! Clean slate. You're welcome. Wow. Really? Yeah, come on, shut up. Well, thanks, Tommy. Oh, man. I still got all that mojo flowing through me. You know, I-I got to get it out. I'm gonna take this van to the beach and peel off some burnies. You want to come? Um what's a wh-what's a burny? Ah! Ah, I'm gonna throw up! I want to go home! What? This is fun! Oh, no more burnies! All right, people, line up! You'll see we have many noteworthy specimens on the beach today. Only a dollar to get a closer look at the action. Step right up! Look through this tube, see some boob. Give me the green, see some peen. Hey, this is gross. We came all this way to see old people? Ew! Nasty! You tricked us. I want my money back. Uh-oh. Whoa-whoa, wait, whoa-ho-ho, you guys, you're looking at this the wrong way. You want to see nice bodies?! Get a magazine! This is real, people! Check out that guy. What is that? Is that a liver spot? Is that a birthmark? Is that a third nipple? Who knows? You can't write this crap! Hold up, hold up, hold up. Let me see. I get it. Yeah, I guess, on second look, it's better. This, uh first song goes pretty deep. It's called ""Daddy."" Uh at least it's, uh, uh, a family song.  Daddy! You abandoned me!  Daddy! You sold drugs to me!  Punches are not hugs to me! Eh. It's no ""Elderly Prostitute."" Bobby, you said you talked to him. Uh, I did, kinda. But then he wiped our record clean.  Daddy! You're my enemy!  You are my enemy! My enemy!  You are my enemy! My enemy!   My enemy! No, don't. It's just me, just me, just me.  My enemy! Oh, sorry.  You, you, you!  The Itsy-Bitsy Stripper climbed up the brassy pole   Down came her legs and wrapped around my soul   Weave your web of your sexy web   Weave your sexy web around me   Weave your web, weave your naughty web   Around my body, my beautiful body   My beautiful legs, my beautiful torso   Weave that web around me Hurdles on a beach? What are those silly little skin bags up to now? Wait a second. This can't be. Ow! Uh, guys, you might want to buy seats now, for tomorrow's event. ""Nudecathlon."" That sounds like decathlon, but nude. They're naked and old and they're bringing home the gold! Go! You go talk to him! All right. Tommy, listen, there's something I need to talk to you about. I was thinking, maybe, um you could take some time off from performing uh, here. What? What, what are talking about, Bobby boy? It's just that, um you know, you could be performing at at way different places. Huh, it's almost like you're saying you don't want me to play here anymore. No. Not No. You took that the wrong way. Uh-huh. What I meant was you're great. Right. Um, but just not maybe for, for here. I'll tell you what's funny, you know, that's what the manager over at Pistol McSwish's said, too. Did he? Yeah, kind of exactly. Oh. And it's a shame about that guy you know, he got shut down by me. What are you doing? You know, I hate to say this, but, you know, you got rat turds on your floor, man, and, yeah, I-I gotta write that up, unfortunately. What? Tommy, that's crazy. You just carry around bags of rat turds in your pocket? Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, look over see, I see some more right over here, see? You didn't even empty that one! You're saying a rat just came in here and tossed a bag of its poop on my floor? Yeah, that's a thing that happens. And look, you know, it can all go away. Just let me do an encore, and then come back and play every night. No, Tommy! You're not gonna hold us hostage with your crappy music and your threats! Crappy?! So get out of my restaurant, Tommy! Okay! Of course, you know what this means: Until further notice, you are shut down, my man! Fine! Why don't you get out, my man?! Oh, gladly, my man! Oh, and guess what?! You do have bulging eyes! And it is off-putting! So, uh h-how did, uh, how'd it go? Great. We're hungry, Bobby! Open up! I can't, Teddy. Tommy closed us down. If I serve you, I could go to jail. We're willing to take that chance! If Tommy doesn't let us open, we'll be broke by next week! We gotta fix this, Bobby! There's only one person who can help us now. Oh, God. Oh, don't be so nervous. It's natural. What's going on here, anyway? - Naked field day! Fun! - Ugh. Bubbila, bubbila. There he is. I can't believe I'm gonna grovel to a naked Hugo. Bob! Linda! You're just in time to see me excel at nude tetherball! Hugo, look, I've come to ask for your help. The guy who replaced you shut down the restaurant. Oh, Bob, that's a pity. But the health-inspecting world doesn't interest me anymore. Come on. This guy's nuts, Hugo. He, he planted rat poop. You wouldn't even do that. Listen to you, Bob! It's all about things with you! Restaurants! Rat feces! Underwear! Oh, God. Today is the Nudecathlon, so either you join me in nude brotherhood or kindly return to your clothed country. All right, all right. What, what if I did join you? The more the merrier. But what if I competed and beat you? Uh, you won't. But if I did, would you help us out then? Is this some kind of bet, Bob? Yeah. It's a bet. And what do, what do I get if I win? Well, what do you want? You have to cater the Nudecathlon closing ceremony for free. If this is what it takes, this is what it takes. Bob, you do realize what you're getting yourself into. A nudecathlon has 27 events, not including warm-up freeze tag. I quit. No, Bobby, come on! You can do it! Parlays, exactas, trifectas! We're taking all action, people! Louise, you're gonna want to see this. We played with fire, and this is what we get fire in our eyes! I think Dad looks pretty good, considering he's had three kids. Hey, Dad, stop stretching like that! Oh, my God! Zeke here, calling the action for you on this sunny afternoon. There can only be one winner today, but many floppy wieners. And they're off! Doughboy's out to an early lead! Go, Bobby, go!  History repeats itself, try, and you'll succeed  You've got a tough day ahead of you, Bob.  And you can have your dream  You're the best around Ooh! Like sand through his hourglass!  You're the best around  Nothing's ever gonna keep you down   You're the best around Point: Hugo.  Nothing's ever gonna keep you down  Big fatty wins the tug! Bad luck, little fatty! Three legs, four thighs and two ding-dongs. Now that's one nasty bucket of chicken!  Try your best to win them all   And one day, time will tell  When you're the best that's standing there   You'll reach the final bell  I'm the best around  Nothing's gonna ever keep me down   I'm the best around How are we holding up, Bob? Fine! Just great! Well, I must say you've proven yourself a worthy naked adversary. But this last event is for all the marbles. Don't say marbles. Line up for Greco-Roman wrestling! Go, Bobby! You're my big naked knight! I'm dying. Gentlemen, enter the ring. May the best nude win. May the best nude win. Ah, not there. There you go. Take this one. Let go! Sweep the leg, Dad! Sweep the leg! Treat him like a naked piÃ±ata, Dad! Break him open for some candy! Okay, Bob, time to do this! Not today, Bob! Oh! The little guy flips the fay little a patty! We've got a pin! No! Yes! I win! You took Linda from me, you were the scourge of my professional life, but this time, I win! You can get off me now, Hugo! Never! I win! Let's go home, Lin. All right. I win, win, win! Wow. That was rough. Naked and defeated. Just the way he entered this world. Bobby, you put your pants on backwards, honey. Doesn't matter. None of it matters. We lost the restaurant, Lin. Tina, let's put our pants on backwards, too. Let's do it for Dad! I'm wearing a skirt, but okay. Hugo? What are you doing here? And why are you wearing clothes? Or is that just body paint? Today, at the beach, you tasted my sweet victory, but I realized something: It wasn't enough. What does that mean? I want to shut you down I do not some dirty doody-dropper me. Until then, you're open for business. Ron? You got it, buddy. All right! Well, thanks, Hugo. All right, everyone! Load in! - What's going on? - The closing ceremony, Bob. Remember? You have to cater it. Disrobe at will! Don't bother with courtesy tissues on the seats. Gettin' nude for food! I love it! Hold the buns. Am I right?! Well, better clean up the gum under the tables. I'll get to it. Tina, no. I hate you, Hugo. Wait what about Tommy Jaronda? How we doin', Jimmy Pesto's?  I'm a bad man with a master plan   And the ladies call me Tex   And the one thing all the ladies know is   I'm good at having  Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, sex-sex-sex-sex-sex   I'm good at sex, I'm good at sex   I'm very, very, very, very good at sex   I am good, you are good, too  You're learning, little by little   I'm guiding you with my hand and my arms   I'm good at sex, you're learning quick"
"Lookie, lookie. My green blazer from when I had jury duty on Saint Patrick's Day. What's the blazer for? Tina's gonna wear it at her audition tomorrow for the school news channel. I want to be serious newswoman, like Holly Hunter in Broadcast News. ""It must be great being right all the time. No, it's terrible."" Aw. I need to practice being a television journalist. Dad, can I interview you? Um, okay. Don't look directly into the camera, Dad. I got it. So, tell me, why burgers? Well, my dad got me started Do you see this as a stepping stone - to a real restaurant? - It is a real restaurant. Mm, slop shop. Can you cook anything other than burgers? Yes, lots of things. - Like? - Like, um like, paella. Paella tell me how you make that. Well, I'd have to look up the recipe, but, uh So you don't know how to make paella? No, I could make Okay, I'm confused, because a minute ago you were an expert. Dad needs media coaching. Look, I randomly said ""paella."" I didn't mean to. Ah, I'm going in tight. Bob, get off paella. All right, interview's over. Get that camera out of my face. I think we got what we need. You look amazing, sweetie. And you're gonna look even better on camera. You inherited my strong chin. Where's your strong chin, Mom? I can't see it. Keep looking, you'll find it. What did I inherit from you, Mom? You got my zest for life. And my extra long pinky toe. And I got your birthing hips. Actually, Gene, you take more after your father. No, hips don't lie. Look at this. I forgot that I went through a Judd Nelson phase. That's your father when he was your age. He looked just like you. Wait, does that mean when I'm his age, I'm gonna look just like him? Spoiler alert! No! Hey, you could do worse. I don't see how! At least you know your shoulders won't go bald. Gene, it's starting. I found this on your pillow! Ah! Oh, my God! Quick, come me over! Trump me! - Louise - What? You're not going bald, Gene. Apologize, Louise. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. It's okay. What's the point of clinging to this, if I'm doomed to be that? - Huh. I don't know. - Lin. Why wait? Let's do it now. I want the whole Bob. - Male-pattern baldness. - Hmm. - Stoop shoulders. - Stop. - Paunch. - Please. And the push broom on my lip. This is incredibly insulting. Think about how I feel. You really let myself go. Go to school. - We're going. - Bye. Remember, kids, this is just the student news, no pressure. I'll only be going back frame by frame and critiquing you on eye contact, presentation and how cool you are. You really want to do this? Okay, first up to the green screen, Zeke with sports. Comin' at ya, Mr. Grant! That game was tighter than a tater in a tailpipe. It was like two babies climbin' on the same boob. Then we lost. Wow, Zeke, I feel like I was there. Next up, auditioning for field reporters, Andy and Ollie. Back to you, Andy. Back to you, Ollie. - Back to you, Andy. - Back to you, Ollie. If only you two were Siamese twins. We can do that. Oh, great! That'd be super helpful if you could figure that out. It looks like it's working. We did it! So sweet. And, next up, for the coveted anchor spot, Tammy. Good luck, Tammy. Uh, I was born lucky, Tina. 'Cause I was born me and not you. And I'm a blonde now, so I'm better than you. I don't like what you say, but I admire the way you say it. Wow, it's Tammy with the news! Whoo!  News News. Tam, slam, thank you, ma'am. Next up, Tina. Oh, hey, Tina, little tip: You're a super fast talker, so talk really slow. Thanks, Tammy. Whoa! That's still way too fast. Mr. Grant, I'm here because I have a nose for news. Great. Now about that green jacket I'm Tina with - Tina. -  with the Paranormal activity! Oh, my God, I'm anchor! Yes! Yes!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Whoo! I am anchor! I'm staff intern? But I already had a sign-off. ""Good-bye, audience."" Well, maybe you could change it to ""Does anyone need juice?"" Does anyone need juice? Hmm. Maybe it'll work better when you have some juice. So, what does the staff intern do? Besides go on juice box runs? Yeah. Oh, lots of things. You know, hand out the juice, make sure people are happy with their juice, clean up all the empty juice boxes. Okay. Isn't there any other important behind-the-scenes stuff I could do to help? Well, there's editing music, effects. That stuff is a blast. Great. But I do those. I mean, if you did them, what would I do? Be the teacher? Yeah, right, Tina, that sounds great. I'll just teach. Little more off the top. Sprinkle on the back and the ears. A little more glue.  Buh, buh, buh, buh Show me, show me! VoilÃÂ ! It's perfect! I've been tarred and Bobbed. I don't know how I got that arm hair to look so sad, but I did it. Can I get in here? I need to Oh, my God! It's like looking in a mirror! No, it isn't, Gene. Who's Gene? I already can't tell who's who. Take that stuff off. Lin, get in here and settle this! Don't call your mother Lin. What? Oh! Wha h-hey! Whoa, travel-size Bob. Aw. Linda, you're encouraging him. I need the bathroom. Oh. Wow, this is confusing. No, it's not. You're my family and I love you, but you're terrible. You're all terrible. - I don't say that. - Well, that's all you say. You do. You kind of do. BOB and GENE: Unbelievable. - Gene. - Bob. All right, enough. Enough. I'm not doing this. Yes, you are. No, I'm oh, my God. Oh, God. He's really good. He's good. - He's not good, Lin. He's not good, Lin. - He's good. - Gene! - What, Bob?! Lin! Lin! - What? - Gene! Lin! Lin! - Gene! - I'm leaving! Aw, he's so cute. Stop following me! Stop following me in front! Hi, Mr. Branca. Careful, Tina. Slippery. Did Mrs. Persky's water break? I may have won the baby pool. Worse. Someone dragged in a dog turd. And this isn't the first time, either. You have great stories, Mr. Branca. I ever tell you you're, like, my best friend? Oh. Thank you. Look, this news show competes for students' attention with cell phones, gossip and bathroom graffiti. We need to be faster, meaner, and graffiti-er! So, what I'm I have a cran-apple, two grapes and a bunch of kiwi-strawberry. Here's the crazy straw you asked for, Zeke. Extra crazy, just how you like it. Could be crazier. Now, who knows the five W's of school news? Oh, ""who, what, where, when and sometimes why."" Or, is that vowels? No! They're ""wow, woo-hoo, way hot, weird and what the mmm."" Every story we do should have all five. I got one: New kid nip slips! Way hot, Zeke! Oh, whose parents are poor? Woo-hoo, Tammy! I've got one. The custodian says someone is tracking in dog poo. What the huh? Less caca, more gaga, Tina. Anyone else? I hear there's a 45-year-old fourth grader with a mustache walking around school. Now that's pretty ""what the ah""! Go with that. This is WSN, the news you need from the students you like. In your face! I'm Tammy Larson and these are the breaking stories. What's up with Brenda? I mean, right? Jimmy Pesto Junior previews dance moves the principal won't allow at winter prom. This one's out. Can't do this. Forget about this one. I love it, but it's not news. Now, to our top story: Lenny Destefano is there enough of him to go around, and how can we ration our passion? Jocelyn, who's Lenny going to the winter prom with? No one knows. He's going out with Julie, but he's been texting the entire drill team and me. And me, also. Oh. Now to Zeke with dodgeball highlights. Thanks, Tammy! Here's a kid getting it in the muchachos. Ooh! Here's another dude, right in the Easter eggs. Boing! Watch this geezer with a 'stache get his. It's okay, I've had my kids. Hey, Tina, I saw the news. Is that true about Lenny and the drill team? Julie deserves better. The school deserves better news. Well, I just got back from the library. More shoe poopy got dragged in up there. All the way to the reference section. Talk about Encyclopedia Brown. I I don't get it. Wait, that's a pretty long way to track something in on a shoe. I'm gonna poke around. Something doesn't smell right. That's this. Oh, yeah. So it is applesauce, but try to find it in the sauce aisle at the supermarket. You'll be sorely disappointed. Anyway, I was looking for chutney. Uh, is this a long story, Teddy? I mean, it has been long, but is it longer? I haven't gotten to the story part yet. Gene, I need you behind the counter. Just stand here and I'll be right back. I'm not sure I appreciate being foisted off like this, Bob. So, anyway, I end up in the ethnic food section. Mm-hmm. - It was like a whole new world opened up. - Mm-hmm. I bought baby food from India. Those babies are tough. No joke on those slices. That's fascinating, Teddy. Little Bob is great. Yeah, I guess I'll keep him. Lin, stop. You stop. No, stop, Lin. No, you stop, little Bobby. Mm-hmm, stop. Bobby, stop. Look at you two, you're like an old married couple. We put up with each other. All right, enough, Gene. Gene, get back to the kitchen. How could dog poop make it all the way up two flights of stairs and into the library on a shoe without being wiped off? Tele-poop-tation? Let's experiment. We need something the exact same size and texture as poop. How about Dad's burger? It's even the same color! Great idea. What the hell are you kids doing? Walking on one of Dad's burgers to see how much like dog doo it is. Oh, science. It's clean. That can mean only one thing: The poos must have come from inside the school. Which means, they're probably human! I knew there was a story there. We're looking at a serial pooper. Oh, my God. Is it you, Louise? I've dabbled in the area, but I don't get enough food to be a serial pooper. I, uh, probably only poop once a week. I think I'll call the culprit the Mad Pooper. Ooh, I got a better one. The Butt-ler. Get it? I get it. It's got ""butt"" in it. Butt. Whatever we call him or her, it's definitely news. That's toilet journalism, Tina. We do gutter journalism. But there's a Mad Pooper loose in the school. It's the job of the news to inform the public. It's worth it, even if we save just one shoe. Yuck. Well said, Tammy. The Mad Pooper story is ten times bigger than Lenny Destefano's love life. And less disgusting. He'll put his lips on anything with pom-poms. But I can't get it out there. WSN has a news monopoly. So do your own newscast. My own newscast? You think I could do that? Who's the one yammering about her nose for news? Me? Yeah, this nose right here! Ow! Get it sniffing! Snort some news up there! I can't snort 'cause you're holding my nose. There's gonna be lots of things holding you back! - Okay. - Snort it up! Come on, Cronkite, snort! It's for the good of the people! Let me know when you got something. My diorama got diarrheaed. I think I just snorted a story. Dad's old camcorder, a VCR and a videotape? Say hello to your state-of-the-art studio. But, this is Gene's birth. There's a lot of crowning stuff that can just be taped over. Looks like an angry softball trying to get out of a coin purse. Hmm, okay. Listen, princess, I don't even know what you're talking about, but you can do anything you set your mind to. And, no matter what, your mother and I will always love you. He's good. That kid just fathered the crap out of you. He did okay. I did great. Little preachy. You got a lot of shine on you, Tina. How did you get equal time on the school network? I told Principal Spoors I had incriminating pictures of him. Because I drew some incriminating pictures of him. Great, let's do this. These halls are calm now. But on Wednesday, it was a different story. I left my shoebox diorama for a minute and someone pooped in it. It was about the Industrial Revolution. Some call him the Mad Pooper. My mom calls him the Butt-ler. By any name, these brown thumbtacks tell a tale of terror. Excuse me, can I go get my medicine at the nurse's office? Shh. I'm watching this. Oh. Oh, no. Who would do such a thing? We turn to an expert, Mr. Frond. It's someone trying to communicate. Likely, a foreign- exchange student. He or she has something inside them they desperately want to get out. - Rage? - Poo. And what do Wagstaff students think? My message to the Mad Pooper is: Grow up! I did. Whoever the Mad Pooper is, he or she is probably not finished. And if they're not, I'm not. In the hall, I'm Tina Belcher. And we're clear. Yes, I did it. Take that, Tammy. And Holly Hunter. I lied, we're not clear. Okay, now we're clear. I'll just edit that part out. Oh, okay, good.  Ah, damn it, we got poop-scooped! Tina's story is all anyone's talking about. Tammy, what happened? Well, you said gaga, not caca. This caca is gaga! Now get me that story. I don't know how. Do it, or I'll replace you with the weird twins. Back to you, Andy! Back to you, Ollie! Whoa, okay, no, no, no! Forget it. Hey, Tina, great Mad Pooper reporting. Thanks. Can I copy you like I do in math class? Real news isn't about copying. And you shouldn't copy me in math. Yeah, well, you should get a tutor, 'cause I got a ""C."" You got a ""C""? Wait, I got a ""D."" You know what? I'll do my own story. And it'll be way better than yours, you lame-pon. Good, I hope it is. It will be. Because then we'll have more information about the Mad Pooper Tina, we're trash-talking; Stop turning it into a normal conversation. Oh. Sorry. Um, skank? That's much better! Uh, I hate your new hair color. Give it to me! Your eye shadow is a little much. In the face! My face! Our top story: Is Tina the Mad Pooper? What if actual surveillance footage existed showing Tina in the act? Let's go to a reenactment of what that footage might look like. She was always so quiet. Yeah, she kept to herself. Yeah, she did. She did. So, did Tina create the very story she reported on? Mr. Grant is here to comment. When Tina auditioned, frankly, I was physically afraid of her ambition. She would've done anything to get on TV. And now, apparently, she has. Ah. And what if WSN had an exclusive video confession? Me Tina are Mad Pooper. You don't believe that just because it was on TV, right? Got it. Tina? Principal's office, now. I didn't do it. Follow the money. I'll take a poop detector test. Poop on me once, shame on you. Poop on me twice, we're not best friends anymore! It's not me, it was a reenactment. If it didn't happen, then how could they reenact it? Huh. Uh, yeah. Oh, you should be a teacher instead of secretary, Ms. Schnur. I know. Louise, why are you here? Tammy didn't frame you. Unrelated charge. And now we wait. At least you're guilty of something. I got framed. Cry to Principal Spoors when he gets back from the anti-smoking assembly. Oh, my God, the assembly! The whole school is there. Can you think of a better place for the Mad Pooper to strike? The Super Bowl, American Idol, Westminster Dog Show, upside-down roller coaster, International Space Station, yoga retreat, inside a T-shirt gun If I could just get out of here, I could clear my name. I'll take care of Ms. Schnur. Oh, no, look, they're towing a high-mileage, smallish car with a bumper sticker about a personal passion maybe? ""My other car's a cat""? That's the one! No! I hope Ms. Schnur's car's okay. Go, Tina! Oh, yeah. All right, missy, this better be good. Louise, where's your sister? Tina's not here, Gene. Don't you sass me! Hey, I don't even let Dad talk to me like that. We got here as soon as we could. Gene, what are you doing here? They called me! No, they called me. I can't believe my daughter is the Butt-ler. I have no daughter! Oh, don't say that, Gene. Yes, he should say that. Come on, she's down at the assembly trying to clear her name. Our lives were so much simpler before the rug rats. We use to see movies Lin! Sorry, but it's true. Cigarettes are the real devil sticks. Nicotine is a bad scene. You're here somewhere, Mad Pooper. Let's stay focused; We got to find Tin Ooh, jugglers! Hey, can I get a light? Sure, smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is kind of a weird message. I really want a cigarette. I really want to juggle. - No sign? - Nothing. Oh, my God, look. The Pooper. I need to get up there. But how? You could use that hydraulic scissor lift. Perfect. I'll sneak up on him. I'll be as quiet as a mouse. Kelly Mathis and Jocelyn are wearing the same scrunchie. But Jocelyn is definitely wearing it better. Mr. Grant, look. It's Tina. What's she doing up there? Maybe she is the Mad Pooper. Hey, we're better than we thought. Let's get that camera. Yeah, catch her in the act. On the big screen! That's a big load of news. Look, everyone! It's the Mad Pooper! Ah, it's Tina! Tina, what are you doing? Get down! Oh, my God! Come out of the shadows, Mad Pooper. - Zeke? - Surprised? Zeke's the Butt-ler! Why'd you do it, Zeke? Well, the first time was an accident. But the second time was for fun. Then accident, fun, fun, another accident, three funs in a row, then after that, I was doing it for you, Tina. - Aw. - Aw. But now it's over. It's not over. I got one left! Zeke, no. Poop! Poop! Poop! CROWD Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Stupid kids, listen to them. Poop's not funny. I mean, it is a little, but what sort of message are we I can't stand it! I want to see him poop! I want to be a kid again! Poop! Poop! Poop! Oh, thank God. He's back. Aw, I'll miss my Muppet Baby Bobby. You don't have to do this. Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Here we go. This isn't an accident! No, it is, it is. Oh, God. Oh, boy. It's taking a long time. It's a girl! Uh, no, it's a boy! I guess we're really watching this. Bobby, hold my hand. Get out of there! No! Tammy, look out! No! Our top story: The Mad Pooper almost nails me. I'm joined by the girl who saved my hair. Louise, it was so close. I thought it was going to be a lot closer, Tammy, to be honest. But I miscalculated. Wind, maybe. I was scared there was gonna be poop right into my mouth. Let's go to the Mad Pooper himself, Zeke, who, incredibly, is not in trouble. Let's find out why. My family moves around a lot. His family moves around a lot. Uh, WSN would like to apologize for any inadvertent suggestion that Tina Belcher was the Mad Pooper. Our bad. And now, a new WSN feature: The Tina Table. Is it getting hot in here? One study shows the school nurse's thermometer is off by one degree. She's here to discuss it. Later, I'll talk to students about trading snacks at lunch. Is it insider trading? No, it isn't. Look at my news girl, her pretty head floating like a balloon. Is it just me, or does Tina look great without a torso? Wonder how'd she look with a mustache and a bald spot? Oh, I just remembered how to make paella."
"Happy Valentine's Day to all my loves. Smooches. Everyone gets a smooch. Oh, give Gene mine. I'll take it. I hope a certain wife is ready to be romanced. Huh? Oh. Oh, Bobby.

You'll have one minute with these fine gentlemen, and when you hear this-- Kank-kank-- switch partners. But if you hear this-- cra-cra-crank-- change topics. And who's ready to fall in love? Speed date. So, Teddy, this is Gina. You two are now in pre-love. We are? Well, you got 60 seconds to figure it out. So, ticktock, let's go. Uh, I'm Teddy, like Linda said earlier. Um, what do we talk about? Uh, I don't know. What do we talk about? I want to lick this one like an envelope, mmm. Great, mail jokes. Oh, you're a mailman. Kids, how about this cell phone cover? It says, ""Got Milf."" That's perfect, right? For your mom? I'll get this and then I'll bring you kids back to school. School? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Dad, you need to wow her. This is not gonna wow her. I thought you were done half-assing it, Dad. Why can't you be more romantic? What? I'm plenty romantic. Very funny. Stop goofing. What was the most romantic thing you ever did for Mom? I don't know, I planned stuff. I planned a whole romantic day one time. It was her birthday No, wait, it was my birthday No, no, no, wait, it was Valentine's Day. It was our first Valentine's Day together. You are the worst storyteller. Where's Maya Angelou when you need him? Yeah, I made a picnic basket and I picked out a spot to watch the sunset, and then my car died. So we had to get towed to the mechanic's. Tell me exactly what was wrong with the car-- was it a gasket? Was it the carburetor? Guys, he's telling us a romantic story. While the car was getting fixed, we went to a bar across the street. It wasn't the beach at sunset, but we, uh, we had a great time. Aw. And there was this old beat-up machine, like a love tester or something, and we squeezed the lever together, and it said we were ""red hot."" And she kissed me and that's, uh, that's when I knew we were in love. That's it. Buy Mom the love tester. What do you mean, the actual machine? Yeah, she'd totally marry you if you did that. Dad, do you remember where that bar is? Will it take all day to find it? Hmm, I do think I remember where it is. Oh, really? We've got a mission. The most noble mission there is-- a love mission. It's a missionary position mission. Yeah, she'd really like that. Probably get it for, like, 50 bucks, tops. All right, I'll drop you off at school and then I'll go to the dive bar. That's crazy. School is way out of the way. They're doing construction on that one street, it's raining-- what a clusterjam. We should go with you, Dad. All right, you can come, but then right back to Uh-uh-uh, not another word about school. To the dive bar! Next dating game speed hand holding. And hold hands. Kank-kank! Teddy, Teddy, you're gonna hurt her. You're not trying to crush her. What? I don't mind it rough. Very good, Mort. You are as limp as can be. Limp and clammy, my signature hold. Sergeant Bosco! What are you doing here? Someone just robbed a jewelry store on Front Street. He fled on foot in this direction so we're going door-to-door. Oh. All we know is he's five-ten to six-feet tall with an athletic build. Eh, none of you guys fit that description. Wow, that's harsh. Hey. A few years ago. Bosco, I couldn't help notice you don't have a wedding ring. Did the guy steal that, too? No, I chucked it into a ravine after my divorce went through. Oh. OFFICER Well, keep looking! Damn, we had him, and then we lost him. Talking to me, Bosco? No! Maybe don't leave your thumb on the button? Eh, what's going on in here? Speed dating. Ladies, I think we've got a new contestant. No, no, if I wanted to feel like a loser, I'd just call my kids. But this is Bob's Burgers' Speed Dating. Ladies and cops eat free. All right, you got five minutes. Okay, couple up, clank-clank! How can I help you? Yeah, I was here about 15 years ago and I-I played this old timey-looking love tester thing. Do you still have it? You mean Dr. Love's Love Testometer? Yeah, that's it. He knows it. Hooray. Eh, the owner sold it a few years ago. Oh, man. Do you know who he sold it to? Nah, no clue, sorry. I know where it is. Hugo! Bob. Bob. Ron. Hugo. Yes, what? Oh. You know where the love testometer that used to be here is? I do. In fact, later today I'm inspecting the establishment where it's currently testometering. That's great. I think you should invest in new soap for your bathroom before you purchase vintage amusements. You think soap's the problem with our bathroom? But it's not for the restaurant. It's my Valentine's Day gift for Linda. Oops, I just forgot where it is. Oh, come on. I'm not helping you buy Linda a romantic Valentine's gift. Maybe you should tell him, Hugo. Maybe I don't want to hear it, Ron. All right. You're such a jerk, Hugo, you know that? There are 97 bars and restaurants in my expansive jurisdiction. Good luck finding it, Bob. BOB Back to the mall, I guess. Don't take this lying down, Dad. But Hugo won't tell us where the testometer is. He said he's inspecting the place today. So, okay, so what day is it? It's today. Right. So you have to follow him. Yes! It's Valentine's Day, damn it. You're right. He'll lead us right to the love testometer. Let's ride. Hyah! But let's get a hot chocolate or something first. It's all rainy out. Great idea, Eugene. Whoo-hoo. Mm-hmm. TINA You're too close! He'll see us. I know what I'm doing. I've got a buffer car. You're gonna lead us right to the testometer. And we lost him. We didn't lose him, we'll catch up. I can still see him. Look, he's turning. No, no, no, don't turn. All right, uh Let's see if I can safely go through this red light. We're losing him. Drive! It's safe! It's safe! Oh, sorry. Sorr I'll go. I'll go Stop! Okay! I'm I'm in the FBI. It's, uh, uh it's official business! S- Sorry. Kank-kank. All right, new game. Everyone say your favorite food. Go. Soy sauce. Wax lips? Plain white rice. Fried green tomatoes. Favorite love-making position. Go! The Fried Green Tomato. The Pick n' Roll. The Broken Sprinkler. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The Sticky Wicket. No, no, no. Getting people to say their favorite things isn't gonna work. Sure it is. If you like the same food or sex angles, you're compatible. I'd do the exact opposite. I'd make everyone say the worst thing about themselves, the most embarrassing, darkest secret. If the other person can stomach you for another second, then maybe you have a chance together, maybe. What? That is the least romantic I want to do it. Let's do it. I'm game. No. I'll go first. Hi there. I'm part of a secret society. We hunt men for sport. Hello. I've had a yeast infection for ten years. Stop. Oh, Gina, no. Sometimes I just put the mail down the storm drain. I knew it. I knew it. Yeah, there you go. I called in a bomb threat once 'cause I heard Mark Harmon was staying at this hotel. I wanted to see him evacuate, and then I stalked him for a year and hit his wife with my car. No, stop it. Saying icky stuff about yourselves isn't what Valentine's Day is about. Now, stop it. Well, it's what love's about. And if you women can handle my baggage, then you can fly with me, but bring a sick bag, 'cause it's gonna be a real bumpy ride. Clean-up, aisle my panties. No. Psst, over here. Huh? Hey, do you have a coin-operated machine in there that predicts love? Can't I just take out the trash one time without getting hit on by some perv? He may be a perv, but that's my dad. Hugo's gonna take forever. We wouldn't have to wait for Hugo to lead us to the next place if we found out where he's going. It's locked. But the window's open a crack. Maybe we can find a hanger or Hangers are for Sunday school clothes. Bring me a rock. We're not smashing the window. It'll look like the rain did it. Do it. Get that clipboard. Gene, stop. RON: Uh, thanks. Hugo would have blamed me for that. Oh, hey. Hi, Ron. This is Ron, what are you doing here? Hey! This not my van. We were just gonna get some ice cream from this truck here. We're just getting the clipboard. Listen, Hugo's wrong not to help you out. I don't know which place has the testometer, but, uh, this is where we're going today. Hey, thanks, Ron. You know, we'll check those places out. You're a good guy to help us. You're a great guy. I look up to you, man. Oh. I wouldn't mind having a friend like you. Okay, let's go, kids. Thanks again, Ron. See you.  Falafel   We're on a love mission   Pizza   We're on a love mission   All the rest   We're on a love mission.  Kids, uh, stay outside. Excuse me, sir, do you have something called the love testometer? I got your love testometer right here, pal. That goes in the buttbank. Yah! Yah! Hyah! Well, this is the last place on the list. It better be here. I'll have a seven and seven. No! Make it an eight and eight. Make mine a double, would you? A 16 and 16, thank you. I'm good with water. No, wait. Um, yeah, just water. Kids, please. Look, I-I've been driving all over, trying to find my wife this Valentine's gift, and you're my last hope. Everybody loves these tiny umbrellas. How many does she want? No, no, no. I'm actually looking for Dr. Love's Love Testometer. Please say you have it; I want to buy it from you. You want to buy my love testometer? You-you actually have it? Yeah, it's right over there. It's exactly as I remembered. It's beautiful. I'd love to sell it to you. Great! But I can't, I already sold it. Hello, Bob. Lookie what I just boughtie. Odd bumping into you here, Bob. Oh, wait. No, it's not. I knew you were coming, thanks to Mr. Opens-the-van-for-anyone over here. Hugo noticed the missing carbon copy from the clipboard. Nerd. Now Ron's not allowed to ride up front with me in the van. Come on, Dad, you need to get that testometer for Mom. I'm starting to disappear. How much did he pay for that? A hundred bucks for that junk. All right. Hugo, please sell me the love testometer. Uh, no. Hugo, this isn't about me and you. This is about giving a woman a gift to make up for years of-of Crap? Well, not quite crap, Tina. Last-minute nothings? Crap. Listen, Hugo, please sell it to me. Linda deserves it. Okay, Bob, I will sell it to you. For $500. But you only paid $100. $500? Is that thing magic? You want it or not, Bob? Of course he wants it. It's just his money's all tied up in real estate right now so Do you take fake credit cards? All right, fine. Another thing about me, I'm hooked on pills. The bad kind that make you feel good. I like to play with a yo-yo, so something comes back to me. People, enough with the confessions. You should know that there's hardwood under this carpet. Yeah, there you go. Stop, Mort, keep that carpet on. Damn it, Sergeant Bosco. You're infecting everyone with your poison. Don't you have a jewelry store thief to catch or something? That's why I have one of these; it's called a radio. And one of these; it's called a gun. Yeah, well, what you don't have is one of these. A heart. Mmm. Ugh. Pleasure doing business with you, Bob. Wow. Now you won't have to get Mom another gift for 30 years. Yup. This is the best present ever, a living memory. Your Mom and I even carved our initials on the side. See? Who's ""BB""? Bob Belcher. No, who's the other ""BB""? Uh, what other Oh, God. This is fun. What? Barbara Bunkley! Oh, how could I have forgotten that Valentine's Day was with Barbara Bunkley? Who is Barbara Bunkley? What was I thinking? Barbara Bunkley! Will someone please tell me who Barbara Bunkley is?! I'm guessing it's our real mom. And she's beautiful and sporty. She was my girlfriend the year before I met your mother. I can't believe that. The date I'm remembering wasn't with your mom. What a moron! So this love mission was a sham? Hugo, I don't want it anymore. Take this stupid thing back. Oh, no, Bob, no refunds. Okay, okay, there we go. I guess we're a little short on women, huh? Yeah, yeah, work those nubs. Ooh, that's it, right there. Another hard truth about me Oh, you stupid I pepper-sprayed my barber, but I mean, look at this. Here it goes. I dress up as Santa every night. It's the only way I can go to sleep. Uh What, Miss ten-year yeast infection. See a doctor, why don't you? I have a prison pen pal. He thinks my name is Michelle. Technically he's my fiancÃ©. I also ran over Vinny Testaverde's wife. Oh, that's it! Everyone needs to stop listening to this cruddy duddy right now! Kank-kank-kank. Too bad, Linda, you just don't know anything about dating. Yes, I do. Then why is everyone listening to me? They're not. They are. Oh, yeah, well, without this Whoa! no one's gonna listen to you anymore, tough guy. Yeppity-do, da-da-da. Sha-ba-da-ba-bum. Uh, Lin, I don't think you can take a police officer's gun. Sure I can. I just did. Look. No, I mean, by law. Do you have any idea what you've just done? No. Kind of. Is it bad? You're under arrest. Oof, oof, tight. Too tight. Shush. One size fits all. Shut up. What's going on? Mommy's getting arrested. What? Whoa-ho-ho, I thought Dad blew it. Yeah, well, Mommy blew it real bad here today. She blew it. Oh. What's going on is taking an officer's sidearm is a felony. Whoa, Mom, you took his gun? She sure did, Louise. I just wanted to get control of speed dating. That does not seem like a thing you would need a gun for. Where have you been, Bobby? We spent all day helping Dad get you the perfect Valentine's gift. All day? You kids weren't at school? Dad sprung us. I wanted to do something special for you today. We we went all over town trying to find this thing from our first Valentine's Day together. Dad ran a red light. We went to Chinatown. And Pickles. Pickles? And I spent $500 on it, but it wasn't from our first Valentine's Day together. It was from a Valentine's Day I spent with Barbara Bunkley. I remembered it wrong. I'm so sorry, I'm I'm an idiot. So you're telling me you let the kids play hooky to run all over town to hunt down some expensive thing you remembered from a date we didn't even go on? Yes. That is so romantic! Aw. Aw. What? Oh, Bobby! You went through all that trouble for me. This is the best Valentine's Day ever. Ever! Give me that. So you came here for speed dating? No. A jewelry store got robbed. The suspect was spotted in the area. But you stayed for speed dating? Yeah. You must be hard up for chicks. Yup. I'm sorry I'm getting arrested on Valentine's Day. Come here. Ow. Ow. So, uh what, I'll-I'll follow you two down to the station? Yep. This little lady is going right to Shh! Shh! Wait! Shut up! Shut up! OFFICER Be advised. Jewelry store suspect spotted at 15th and Grand. All right, I'm on my way. You, follow me. Well, I guess it's your lucky day. You talking to me? No, for God's sake. I'll show you how to use the radio when you get back to the station. Oh! It's so easy to call in a false tip. Those streets don't even intersect. Hi, Tina. Hi, Jimmy, Jr. You weren't at school today, so I brought you your homework. Thanks. And a Valentine's card. Aren't you gonna open it? ""Heart"" not ""from."" Yes. So, see you at school tomorrow. I'd really ""heart"" that. Uh, what? I'd really ""hea"" I got to get going. Yeah, me, too. So, that, uh, stuff you said earlier, that's the worst about you? Yup. That's it. Oh, except for one time Oh, oh, oh! Don't say it. Here's my number. Hey, I made a match! I bet I screw this up. Kank-kank-kank.    Two people   Together forever   Security in life   And someone to love ya   Instead of being all alone   Such a lonely existence     Two people   Together forever   Security in life   And someone to love ya   Instead of being all alone   Such a lonely existence   I'd kill myself."
"Tina, quick, Rorschach test, go. Um, Greg Kinnear from As Good as It Gets? Yes, wow. Shh, shh, I'm on the phone with the bank. Okay, so bounce the check to the power company, bounce the check to the relish guy, but make sure the beef supplier goes through. Without beef, the whole system falls apart. Yeah, at least my bedroom beef supply is free. Yeah. Sheesh. Thanks, Marci. You're a lifesaver. I'll talk to you later, honey. God, I can't believe we're doing controlled bounces, and I can't believe you talk that way to the bank. Oh, what, with Marci? It's okay. We don't have any secrets. You know, her husband had to get recircumcised last year. The first one grew back. They don't grow back. Somehow it did. They had to have an adult ""brisk""; it was freaky. It's not a brisk; it's a bris. All this brisket talk is making me hungry. And why do you do the books this way? Your system is crazy. It's the only way to keep our heads above water, my love. Well, then, we've got to find a way to cut down on expenses. What can we live without? Uh, probably Gene and Tina. That's a good start. Huh, well, it makes the things I was gonna cut irrelevant. Good. You know what? I could get a part-time job. Huh, what? No, Lin, it hasn't come to that yet. Yeah, you're right. Hey, maybe I'll start shopping at that Fresh Feed place up the street. I hear it's really cheap. Oh, yeah, that's good. They have those peanut butter mini donuts. I prefer the yogurt-covered peanut butter mini donuts, but, hey, I have a refined palette. Refined? You lick your own armpits. They're naturally spicy. ""People go nuts for our nuts."" What a hoot. I love it. ""In a hurry for some curry?"" Hmm, kind of. Mmm mmm mmm. Hey, buddy, one sample per customer. A serving size is four mini egg rolls. Therefore, four pieces equals one sample. Good day, sir. I think there's someone behind the milk. Maybe it's a dairy fairy. Or a stalker watching our every move with their creepy frozen eyes. Hi. Look at these crazy low prices. Excuse me, Greg. Uh, hi, Greg. Yeah, can you tell me where the wine is? Ah, the grown-up grape juice. Come with me to our vineyard. Ooh, wine in a squeeze bottle. Fun. Oh. Huh? It's time for a disco minute. How long's it last? A minute. It must be great working here. Yup, we have fun. It's kind of our thing. I love it when a place has a thing. And the hours are flexible, which is fantastic for someone like me. You never know when the perfect breeze is going to blow. Huh? I'm a semipro kite pilot. A what? I don't understand. What part do you not understand? The words-- I don't understand them. I'm a kite pilot. Kite pilot. Mm-hmm, my babies. Okay. Wow, that's great. So there's flexible hours here, huh? Hey, did this just become a job interview? You interested? Me? What? No. No, I don't know, I couldn't-- no Guess who got a job at Fresh Feed. Check it out. That's what Mom will be doing at the checkout. Yeah, paper or plastic, Mom? Am I right? All right. What, you got a job? But it hasn't come to that yet, remember? I think what Mom's trying to say is: ""Take this job and shove it, Bob!"" Yeah, I'm bringing home the bacon now. Oh, I forgot to get bacon. We have to go back! You really got out of bed this morning. I couldn't wait! Oh, I'm so freaking excited about my first day on the job! Yeah, I heard you the first time, when you were singing in the shower.  I'm so freaking excited  About my first day on the job.  Yeah! Ow, ow! Soap in my eye! You finally got out, Mom. Don't look back. It's only part-time. Don't be so dramatic. It's just something I'm doing to save the family. No big deal. Hey, Greg! Hey, Linda. Show me around. Give me the tour. Okay. A little pushy there. Ooh, is that a water cooler? Oh, God, I'm gonna be gossiping around a real water cooler like on TV! I love it. Aw This is the bread aisle. There's Mitch. He's in a Steve Miller Band cover band. Hey, does anyone call you the Space Cowboy? Yeah, but right now I'm the Gangster of Loaves. Ooh Good one, Mitch! They get funnier every time. It's a little buggy in produce. Yeah, turns out flies like fruit. Thanks for pointing that out, though. How you gonna get by without Linda, Bob? She's only working part-time. I'll be fine. Did Linda show you how to work the thermostat? It's the same as it always is. No. Linda accounts for outside temperature, grill temperature, the number of customers in here. Linda can play that thermostat like a violin. Now that you mention it, I do feel a little shvitzy. Oh, me, too. Shirt's coming off. Fine, I'll turn it down. That's not how Linda does it, Bobby. You overshot it. Now we're all gonna freeze. What are you talking about? I moved it, like, two degrees, Teddy. Two degrees is everything. Two degrees killed the dinosaurs! Fine! I'll move it back! Too far again. That's got to come off! Aah! We're gonna start you off nice and easy today. On the ten-items- or-less register. If they have 11, ban 'em or scan 'em. Your call. Oh, my call! Okay. I'm in charge. To a point. Excuse me, did someone lose a monkey? You're gonna do just fine here. Hey, with Linda gone, we can get into some raunchy locker room talk. Hey, let's describe our testicles with a movie title. What? The Wild Bunch! Wait a minute. What are we doing? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. You have one testicle? You knew that. Hey, Bob. Whoa. It's warm in here. Yes, I know, Mike. Thanks. Linda got a part-time job. Teddy, you're looking good. Uh I don't know. You got a lot of bills here. It's all bills. You guys should pay your bills. Mike's smart. Yup. Hey, we're doing locker room talk. Tell us about your testicles. Good-bye.  Linda stocked corn and she don't care   Linda stocked corn and she don't care   Linda stocked corn and she don't care   'Cause she's also got diced tomatoes.  Whoo! Hey nice cans, lady. Kids! You came to see Mommy at her new job? Come on. I'll introduce my home family to my new work family. Hey, Jamie, these are my kids. Kids, this is your new brother, Jamie. Hey, what's up? Go ahead with the tour, Mother. I'm going to visit with James. That's right, I'm part of the Fresh Feed family now, so don't bother with the toothpicks. They just slow me down. Who wants a balloon? Actually, I would like many balloons. I'm gonna do something I should've done years ago. I was hoping you could take me on a tour of the dairy fridge. Oh, yeah. Sure, honey. Yeah. Come on. Ooh! Go! Be free! You'll float for a few days! Maybe a week. Who knows? But you'll live. You'll live! Wow. It's like I'm backstage at a Broadway show about people who buy milk. Ooh, I'd see that show-- sort of. Hey, Linda, grab a mop, will you? Aisle three's got a spill-a-roosh. Will do-a-roosh. That's fun. Okay, I'll be right back, honey. No hurry. What if I put that hand on that arm? And those hips on those legs? Come on, Tina, don't play God. It's dangerous. Oh, that hand is so handsome. What? What? Is someone back there? Maybe. How'd you hurt your finger? My turtle bit me. Oh, no. Ah, I was being a jerk. He was just being a turtle. How old are you? I'm, um How old are you? Uh, you first. We'll say it at the same time. One, two Twenty-five. Really? No, 13. No, 14. Cool! So you like chocolate milk? Yes. No. But yes. You sound complicated. Well, I like it, but my body doesn't like it. So I'm trying to train my body to like it. You're brave. No. I'm lactose intolerant. Labels. Ah. Mom's texting me. I got to go. Wait! What's your name? Or number? Or measurements? He's gone but not forgotten. I'm going to use this to find him. I'm looking for a boy with a turtle bite on his index finger. Isn't every woman? So, did, uh did your mom mention anything about missing the restaurant? No, she seems happy at Fresh Feed. But maybe I just think that because she kept saying how happy she is. Let her live a little, Dad. She's only been off leash one day. Yeah, give the woman some breathing room, needy-saurus rex.  Look at me  I'm wrangling these carts on my own   Look at me  I'm chopping up this lettuce alone   I'm at work  And you can hear me sing  This is working, this is working   Grind, grind, grind, grind   Look at me  I'm sitting in this thing   Grind, grind, grind, grind   Grind, grind, grind, grind   Is it on?

Yeah, I aced my first week. They want me to go full-time. Shift manager. You're not gonna take it, right? No, it's just nice that they appreciate me there. That's all. Oh, come on, Lin. You're feeling underappreciated here? A little bit. What, do you want me to give you a performance review? That would be a nice start, Bob. Hold on, hold on, let me get comfy. And evaluate your wife. Okay. Uh, Linda, you clean the bathroom well. Okay. And you know how to restock a napkin dispenser. All right. But you're on the phone sometimes when you shouldn't be. Ooh. And you don't wear a hairnet and you hair falls out a lot. What?! And you're always sneaking pickles! But you are, um Come on, Dad. You've got this, Dad. You're sometimes friendly to people. Oh!

Hey, this guy's letting us take stuff! Free aisle! All right, I'm going on break. So, what I really want to tell you is you make it fun to work at the restaurant. I'd rather be scraping by together than have extra money and be apart. But I understand if you want to try this new life out. I mean I don't really see the appeal-- it's a pretty nasty market-- but if it makes you happy, then it makes me happy. Hey, come on. That's too much. Oh, Bob, it's awful here. This is just a job. Everyone who works here just wants to leave. I hate it, and I hate the customers. I'm sorry. I know you people can hear me. I just hate it. Yeah, it's called a microphone. She told me she hates you the most. What? Bobby, I want to come back to the restaurant. Oh, Lin Meet me at register five. I'm on my way! Oh, Linda. Oh, Bob. Oh! Oof, shrimp. It's happening! What?

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Wow. I'm Josh. Joshua What's Tina doing? Tina, stop kissing strange boys in the dairy fridge. We're going home! I have to go. Here's a bunch of numbers. They may look random, but they're my phone number. Cool. They look like they're in a good order. Oh, hey, Linda. The strings were tight today, boy. Everything good here? Hi, Greg. Thanks for taking a chance on me. I quit, but don't let that influence hiring other pre-middle-age mothers. Okay, thanks, bye. What? I Hey! Well, I guess, now that I don't work at Fresh Feed anymore, we're back to scrimping and saving. Maybe we can find other ways to make some extra money. If there's one thing I know, it's that sex sells. So all we have to do is find some sex and sell it."
"Anyone notice anything different about me? - New boobs? - New 'tude? Wrong and wronger. I'm pregnant! Wha? We're getting flour sack babies in health class. You do have that glow. Aw, my little baby's having babies. I'm a sexy grandma. I can't believe they're going to let you be in charge of a child. What are you talking about? I was born to be a mother. I'm gonna pull a flour sack out of my bottom. Morning, everyone. Wow, Don Draper's kind of fat this season. Ooh, you look sharp, mister. The jury is gonna find you guilty of handsome in the first degree. Oof, um, ah. I'm contesting a parking ticket, Lin. There isn't a jury. You've got a suit that won't a-quit. Wait a second, there's no stains on that. That's not your suit. My suit didn't fit anymore, so I borrowed this from Mort. Some poor guy's wife brought two for the burial and left this one behind. Why don't I ever get to wear dead people's clothes? When I'm gone, I'll leave you all my socks. Aw, I wanted those.

Cancelling Eddie Money. Wow, you really listen. You're the best. Okay, see ya. Good-bye, Gene. Hey, little man. Huh? Where'd you hear that song you're whistling? It wasn't a song. I- I was making fun of a bird. Well, a little bird told me you might have seen something I'm looking for: A toilet. I haven't seen one. I- I've never even used one! - Come here, just for a sec. - Uh, no. - I want to tell you something. - Ma okay. Yell it. I mean, I mean, I want to give you something. I already have enough. You don't know what it is. I know. I just feel like I know what I can carry and I have my night planned. You won the lottery. Oh. - Then I better go quit my job! - Where is it?! Where's my toilet?! You're my baby boy now, Belcher. I'm not sure, but I think people are treating me different because of this suit. Last night on the street, this homeless guy saluted me. Can't believe I almost buried that suit. If you buried it now, it'd probably claw itself out of the grave to get back on Bobby. That would make a great movie. Suit Cemetery. I'd see that, but only the matinee. I wouldn't want to come home to a dark closet. - Ooh, here comes the three-piece! - Ah, I Bow tie, oh, look out! Oh, it got me!

There's a coffee shop they'll have outlets. For people writing screenplays. Pull over! I'm drunk. Two minutes of battery life remaining. Hey, you can't bring that in here. Your sign says restrooms are for customers only, not that customers can't bring in their own restrooms. That restroom is mine. Hey, toilet guy. Look, my son found your toilet. And I'll never give him back! You just want to take him somewhere where he'll get pooped on! I'll never let that happen! I'll never let anything bad happen to him ever! Battery dead. Good-bye. No! Kid, he's a toilet. He'll be fine once he's recharged. There's a family waiting for him a very nice family so let me take him. He belongs with me, and you'll never be able to move both of us! Yeah, if you think you're gonna get Gene off the toilet before he's ready, I've got some bad news for you. He missed his birthday party once. - We had a clown. - We had to send him in there. You give me that toilet! What's the problem here? No problem, no problem. These people brought in an outside toilet and they refuse to leave. Yeah, you should probably deal with that. Hey, that looks like that toilet that was reported stolen. Welp, sure hope you figure that out. - Freeze! - Stop right there. Get him! - Yeah! - Oh! Where you're going, they don't have any toilets. Well, they do, but it's out in the open and it's embarrassing. Warm my butt. You're useless, useless! Gene, stop yelling at the toilet. It just sits there and takes it. I know that fancy toilet was your friend and you liked him, but he wasn't yours and he's probably evidence now. He needed me to take care of him, Dad, and I let him down. I'll never get to have anything nice, like a bag of flour or a toilet. Look, Gene, it's not easy to take care of things. I mean, one time when you were a baby and I was watching you, you ate a fern, and you could have died, but you didn't. Huh. My point is, you tried to take care of the toilet and you did the best you could. That's all anyone can do. I guess. Sorry I yelled at you. It's not your fault you're stupid. Gene, get in here! Your friend's on TV! This morning, the ferry's most important passenger isn't a person, it's a toilet. It's him! This $14,000 toilet was allegedly stolen by a Timones J aka the Bathroom Burglar. He said his name was Max Flush. And you believed that? - Um - Eh Ah um, no, I'm Yeah no, wha why Fittingly, this royal flusher is headed back to its rightful owner on King's Head Island. Live from the ferry landing, I'm Olsen Benner. Mom, get the car. I have to go to the toilet. Ooh, I got chills when you said that. There he is. Gene, go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, sorry, kid, can't go near that toilet. Uh, Officer, can you cut him a break? It's a long story, but he-he just wants to say good-bye. Kind of weird, but, all right, sir, your kid's got one minute. Hello, toilet. I know you can't hear me, but I just Hello, Gene. Toilet, they charged you. Activate bidet? Yes! I- I mean, no. I think I just have time to say good-bye. Good-bye, Gene. I I love you. Please repeat command. I love you. You would like to vomit? No, I love you. Seat up for vomit. No, I love you. Vomit now. I love you. - Vomit. - I love you! Vomit now. Vomit now. Stop saying that! Vomit now. Damn fool! Okay, this is just sad. I know. Huh, that suit looks just like one my dad had. Yeah, it's a nice one, huh? I love it. Yeah, let me see the label. Um, I There's my dad's name. ""Tailored for Paul McGill."" That's weird his name is Bob Burgers. That's my dad's suit! Where'd you get it? A funeral home? What?! A funeral home. It's a home for funerals. I'll never forget that toilet. I'll never forget that suit. At least you still got your birthday suit. Yeah, too bad it's wrinkly. Let's get Dad dry-cleaned. Nah, I'll press him.  Baby, hold on to me, oh, yeah   Whatever will be will be  The future is ours to see, yeah, come on   So, baby, hold on to me  Hold it  Think about it, baby  I'm gonna take you to the top   So, baby, hold on to me, hold on tight   Whatever will be will be, say it again, the future is"
"Okay, tell me the truth, am I stuck in a laser/dog bark/fart rut? - No. - Yes. Has anyone seen my volcano? Did you check all your pockets? Can you describe what it looks like? Well, it's volcano-shaped, and it's my science fair project from last year. Oh, it's in the liquor cabinet. I've been using it as a wine koozie. It's fun, I love it. Introducing my science fair project for this year. Hold on. Wait, you're turning in the same project again? Will Mr. Blevins let you do that? Yeah, Louise, he's not just a teacher, he's the head of the science fair. He must be swimming in women. Don't worry about Blevins. I can play him like a fiddle. A strange, puffy fiddle with a ponytail and a sad butt. Louise, shouldn't you just do a new project, like you're supposed to? Why? - Um, I don't know, to learn something? - You learn something. Okay honey, good luck with your volcano. What are you two kooks doing? It's for our science fair project: ""How Many Hairs Are Up There?"" The tough part is keeping them all organized. I ga Oh! - One, two - You guys are working too hard. As per ""uuge."" Good morning, children. My name is Mr. Dinkler, and I will be taking over this science class. Whoa, whoa whoa, what? What happened to Mr. Blevins? He's dead. To this classroom. He's at home recovering from a severe attack of gout. But I'm sick of talking about him, so let's just move on already. Some of you might recognize me if you've been down to the Science Museum on Tuesday nights. I am a Thomas Edison impersonator and reenactor. Thomas Edison was the greatest - genius who ever lived. - Oh, boy. Can anyone name any of his inventions? The lightbulb The lightbulb. The phonograph. The kinetoscope. It goes on and on and on, basically everything. So, I know the fourth grade science fair is coming up, because I'm in charge of it now. I only have one rule for science fairs: - No vol-ca-noes. - Huh? Kids have been using these papier-matcher monstrosities to avoid real work for years, and I'll have none of it. Okay, Mr. Dinkler, time out. Relax. I already got the go-ahead - from Mr. Blevins on my volcano. - Huh? So, I'm kind of grandfathered in there. What is your name, young lady? It's Louise, as in ""Jeez, Louise, you're the best."" Why don't we find you another topic? Oh, no, that's not necessary. I already got it. I'll pick one for you. Don't need to, I got one. Yeah Thank you so much. Nope, gonna pick one. And it's the best topic in the world: Thomas Edison! Um, but I'm doing Thomas Edison. You can both do Edison, moron. There's enough of him to go around, trust me. Mr. Dinkler, you're new here, so please don't be offended if I disregard everything you say and turn in Mt. Louise-ius here. Wow, I bet stuff comes out of the top where this hole is and it's just a real hoot. - Yeah. - Oh, no. Oops. Why did I throw that down? Wha - Oh, wha I'm stepping on it? - No! Why am I stepping on it? Over and over and over again. Stop it! Uh-huh. You're doing Edison, kid. How about some science, huh? - Ugh, I can't believe that guy. - Hmph. And now I have to go to the library, which I never wanted to have to do. - Ugh! - Yeah, ugh! Wait, I like the library. I need information on Thomas Edison. Something no one would recognize if plagiarized. Biographies, under ""E."" Thanks. That's my job. And I love it. Topsy. Hmm? I didn't say anything. Tooooopsssyyyyy. Are you saying Top Chef? I think he said Topsy. No, I didn't. Yes, I did. What's a Topsy? I don't know, don't ask me. Look it up. Like in a book? Yeah, sure, books are great. No, use the Internet. Books are stupid. I thought books were smart. No, they're stupid. But you're a librarian. Yeah, so shh! Hmm. Topsy. Look, Topsy the circus elephant. Thomas Edison wanted to show the world that AC current was more dangerous than his own patented DC current Blah, blah, blah. Oh, there's a video. Click that. Ooh, elephant. I bet it sneezes and it's adorable. What was that? Play it again, Play it again. It was electrocuted. To death. On purpose. In public. By Thomas Edison. What is he, a supervillain? Well, it says that Topsy trampled three people. Well yeah, she's a big, fat elephant. The point is, I've got my science fair project. I'm gonna tell everyone the truth about Edison the Electro-cutioner. Tell it, sister. So heroic. Let me finish! And make Mr. Dinkler look like an evil-inventor-impersonating ass. There she is. Oh, right. Don't do it, Don't do it. Do it, do it. And then I say, ""Hey. Lightbulb. The lightbulb. I'm Edison, thank you."" And everyone claps. Mr. Dinkler, shouldn't Louise and I make sure that we're not both doing the same thing for our Edison project? Well, let's see, Jeremy. Is your project going to blow everyone away? 'Cause if it's not, then don't worry about it. What's so funny?! Hey, everybody, volcano-girl here is gonna blow our minds. Did you hear that, Tom? Well, I will! I've got something big, Mr. Dinkler. You ain't got nothing and you know it. You keep believing that, Mr. Dinkler. I will. You keep believing that, Mr. Dink-ler. Yes, yes! Ha! Ha! Ha! Very funny. Ha! Ah! Okay, change of plans. Some little report pasted onto construction paper isn't gonna be enough. Not for that punk. I hate construction paper. Dinkler's a reenactor. I'm going reenactment on his butt. With actors and effects and everything. We're gonna bring this nightmare to life. - Oh. - Oh. All right, I'm gonna need an Edison and a Topsy. Gene, can you give me a maniacal laugh? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Good enough, you're Edison. Tina, act like an elephant. Not bad, you're hired. Oh, you know what else your project needs? - Science? - Music. By me. Something dramatic, but danceable. Cha, cha, cha, cha. Fine, as long as we electrocute an elephant, it's okay with me. But not really electrocuting, just reenacting. Yes, Tina. Jeesh. Little Miss Don't- Really-Electrocute-Me over here. Diva. - Mm-hmm. What else do you want on your rider? Hello, children. Ah, Teddy, come here. I'm doing a project and I need to make huge sparks and lightning bolts. What do you know about that stuff? In high school, my buddies and I built a Van de Graaff generator. You know, to get girls. Ah, nice. Will you do something like that for me? Adults aren't allowed to help, so you'll have to hide. But eh? - Sure. - Let's go! Okay, no burger, that's fine. Ahh, I'm not freaking out here! Ahh I know they're in here somewhere. Bob, come to bed. Here it is. All this science fair stuff reminded me of my old invention. Spiceps. Spice-wah? They're sleeves that you wear on your biceps - to hold all your spices while you cook. - Wha. Look,. Okay, good night. Hey Lin, what if I was wearing just these. 'Cause, whoop, I am. - All right, come here. - I'm coming. Wait, wait, wait, you're getting spice all over the bed. Topsy autopsy Is there something there? I'm not talking; I'm in character. Except, can I trample you? I'm trying to get in that head space. Yeah, sure. Did, uh, did you guys notice my Spiceps? Dad, not now. Pffh, Spiceps. You might have something there, if you just changed it completely. - They're perfect the way they are. - Dad, shush. Okay, Tina, as long as you have perfect pitch, we'll be fine. - And a one, and a two. - ? They'll Hello, family. Ugh. Hi, Aunt Gayle. Hey, Gayle, I couldn't understand you on the phone earlier. You sounded like. Is everything all right? Everything's fine. He can just be such a jerk sometimes. Aw, who honey? Wha? My cat. We got in a fight. Can I stay here for a while to cool off? Of course you can. Hey Gayle, check it out. Okay, talk to you later. Tina, and a one, and a two. ? They'll Hello, Belchers. Damn it! Don't mean to barge in, just here for the monthly rent. I say monthly, because I think there might be some confusion about that. Oh, hey, Mr. Fischoeder. Sorry, I'll write you a check right now. With my arms. Strangely specific, but whatever. Oh, look, a pen. Here. I'm good. - Care for any cracked pepper? - Uh How about some thyme? Just write the check. Perhaps some marjoram? Write a check! How about a bay leaf? Oh. And a one, and a two ? They'll say aw, Topsy? ? At my autopsy - Okay, here's a funny story. - But no You cannot sing. What? Yeah, we're gonna have to replace you. No, I-I have a strong connection to this character. And there it goes. Wha-what about you? Can you sing? Ah, yeah. ? They'll say aw, Topsy? ? At my Oh, my God I can't sing either! What are we gonna do?! That song's catchy. ? They'll say aw, Topsy ? At my autopsy. It is catchy. ? Aw, Topsy at my auuu-ho-ho-hoopsy? ? La, la, la, la, la Holy moly. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? That we should ask Aunt Gayle and Mr. Fischoeder to keep it down? No, we should ask them to sing for us. But we're not allowed to use adults in school projects. We're gonna Milli Vanilli this. Sorry, I don't speak Italian. We'll lip sync it! Lip synch it! So what are you two doing on Friday besides singing from behind a curtain in our school auditorium? God, cooking is just too easy now. So, after a lot of thought and some amazing sewing, I think I finally fixed your invention, Bob. Well, it didn't need fixing, so Ta-da! It's the Spice Rack. Get it? Rack. Ah, well, you look ridiculous. Oh, I look ridiculous? Yeah, you do. - You're both right. - I just took your idea and I made it good. What? No you didn't. Come on, kids, which is better? Pass. No, thank you. Tina? - Tina? - Uh - Huh, how about this? - Huh, huh? - Uh - It's not using sex to sell. - You want this, right? This one. - I love you both equally! Oh, who cares?! Sorry. I love you, too. ? He might electrocute me? ? That's true ? But he's an electro-cutey? ? Aw, shucks. Um wha - AC to DC, come in, DC, over. - DC here. Just give me the go-ahead and I'll flip the switch. Are you sure I'm allowed to be down here? Nope, so if you get caught, we don't know each other. ? Her bosom's mighty ample ? He's just too hot to trample.? - Okay, okay, stop right there. - We're stopping? - No. - Yes. Ah, the theater. Should we fool around back here while we wait? Okay, just let me lick my lips. Eh, never mind. Gene, what the heck is going on with the song? We made it into a love duet. - What?! - Hmm? The whole point of this is to get back at Mr. Dinkler. Or is it that against all odds, a lonely inventor and a down-on-her-luck elephant find true love? Oh, forget it! Let's just get to the pyro. Tina, stand on Teddy's yoga mat and don't move or it's Are you sure this is safe? Teddy, tell Tina your yoga mat will keep her safe because it's rubber, over. My wait, who? Tina, she's standing on the yoga mat. So can we do this? Okay, we can't hear you very well. So let's just go on my count. Three, two, one! My trunk! Wow. Wait till Mr. Dinkler hears about this. Wait till Mr. Dinkler sees this. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Well, I see your point. Huh, huh. It is a little dangerous. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Well, you don't have to do it. We can just use one of Gene's stuffed animals. I'm sure they're tired of being farted on. They love it. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Tina, people must know the truth. Do the reenactment. But what if I get electrocuted? Oh, come on, it's not that bad. - But you died. - Well, you don't have to rub it in. It's just, I'm not What? Tina, tell my story. Also, you should wear your hair up sometimes, girlfriend. It looks really good. Okay, Topsy, I'll do it, but maybe not the hair thing. Oh, come on. It's just awkward with this length. - Try it. - See, I'm trying it right now. Look. You know what, wear it down. This is it. Today Edison and Dinkler are gonna get it right where the lightbulb don't shine. Are you sure you don't want music? - Mm? - No, no music, thank you. You had your chance and you blew it. Fine, then I quit! Suit yourself. Well, now I feel left out. Take me back. All right, you're rehired. Oh, thank God. Thank you. Teddy, what's our pyro status? Did you work out all the kinks? And by kinks I mean almost melting Tina. I think so, except for, uh Nah, I'm sure it'll be fine. Huh, huh, huh. - Tina, why are you making that noise? - Huh, huh. Huh, huh. What is it, girl? Huh, huh. Oh, Tina's just pumped about the science fair. Oh, wow, me, too. Is everybody ready to go? Where's your father? Uh, here I am. What's all that? Uh, just some stuff I thought I'd bring to the science fair. Are you bringing Spiceps? I just want some feedback, Lin. Who knows, maybe there's some wealthy parent that knows a good money-making venture when they see one. That's crazy. I'm going to get the Spice Rack. Oh, hello, Mr. Dinkler. What a day for science, huh? Louise, give me the word when you want me to hit the switch. I know what you're doing, you hooligan. Jeremy saw everything last night. Oh, you son of a snitch! What's your favorite movie? Squeal Magnolias?! War Horse. You're trying to sully Edison's good name, and nobody messes with my man, Tom. You're banned. Get in there. You can't ban me from the science fair. So long, idiot. You're ruining my plan to humiliate you! Oh, oh-oh, oh. Whoop, oh, oopsie. Boy, that, uh, that fell over. Too bad. - Aw. - That's prime real estate. Watch out, someone's coming. Uh, uh, just checking out this great project. This must be a really smart kid, right? Not as smart as this kid right here; She's a genius. Oh, really? I think that kid stole this kid's idea and she should probably get a lawyer. Oh, he wouldn't dare. Oh, he would. I will destroy you. Hooray! Now that Louise is banned, I'm the only Edison project. Jeremy, shush. Right. Young man, I hear you wrote a love duet that dispels those nasty electrocution rumors and shows Edison's softer side. I think that's just what this science fair needs, and I want you to sing it. Really? All right! - What? - I've got to call our landlord and my aunt and maybe some choir kids and maybe a couple of band geeks. If that's how you celebrate good news, sure. But, Gene, what about Louise? What about the truth? What did you say? I was just wondering if we need flutes. Who plays flute? Do you play flute? Louise, some janitor just asked me what I was doing here. I panicked; I said I was a doctor. So if anyone asks, I'm Dr. Glen Wellness. I served in Korea. I handled a triage alone. Just if anyone asks. I delivered triplets in the back of a cab, if anyone asks. Ms. Schnurr, I want to say I totally understand why I'm in here. I was disrespectful. I was out of line, and oh, my God, did you move that picture? Wow. You are fast. I do martial arts. It shows. Hello, hi. Oh, aren't you short? Here, follow me. All right, let's show these people that if it ain't man-on-elephant love, it ain't worth singing about. Attention, everyone. We have a very special treat for you. It's a musical re-imagenactment of the very uplifting story of Thomas Edison and Topsy the elephant. ? They say Thomas Edison ? He's the man to get us into this century? ? And that man is me ? They'll say all What's going on? Where's Louise? And why do Tina and Gene sound like Gayle and Mr. Fischoeder? It's science, Bob. You're not supposed to understand it. Okay. Come on, Ms. Schnurr. Let me out of here. This is my destiny. Shh, I'm trying to eat this yogurt. Toot, toot, here comes books. Creepy librarian. Do I know you? You told me about Topsy. I tell everyone about Topsy. So, here's the book you requested. Good stuff, chick lit. Oh, you've got to help me. Tell her I've got to go to the fair. Tell her I've got to take Dinkler down. Shh, leave me out of it. You started it. I start, I don't finish things. That's my one flaw. So, how's that yogurt? Fine! Forget you! Forget all of you! Eat your yogurt! I'm busting out! Get everything ready, Teddy, because this is happening. I'll get to the radio and when I say ""hit it,"" you hit it with everything you've got. Capisce? Wait, don't leave me. Okay, everything's all right. You're Dr. Glen Wellness. You can handle anything. Hell, you got the highest MCATs in the state. ? But I never noticed ? The curve of her trunk ? And I never noticed ? His electric junk ? We might just have found ? Electric love ? Electric love Wow, did Gene write this? God, I want what they have. It's so romantic. ? Electric love ? Electric love ? Fits like a glove. This is what really happened, people. This man, Thomas Edison, sentenced Topsy, that beautiful elephant, to die by electrocution. Uh-oh. Here's your hero, Dinkler. Hit it! Is that you, Louise? Hit it! I've been down here so long. What's it like out there? Are people still the same with their funny ways? Teddy, hit it! Oh, right, the thing we're doing. Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh. - Oh! - Tina! Tina! Tina? I'm okay. Oh! Oh, God. Oh, thank God. Tina. I thought we weren't doing the death scene, but I saw the sparks and went with it. Was I convincing? Yes, very. Oh, my God, I almost electrocuted my sister. - I've become Edison. - Oh, you wish. So he electrocuted animals. So what? As if everyone here is so perfect. Oh, got a little caught up in the moment. We're in love! We're a couple in love! It's really happening finally! Thank you, God! Got to go. Could have asked me to sing, but whatever. You know, I could've sung it. Louise, is there something you want to say to your sister? Tina, I'm sorry I nearly killed you. I got carried away with the Dinkler thing, which worked out pretty well, but still, I shouldn't have almost killed you. It's okay; This is how Topsy would have wanted it, but with more trampling people. And, Gene, I'm sorry to you, too. Your song was really good. I know, and without a single fart sound. Oh, my God, I forgot the fart sounds! How'd we do? Well, you almost killed my daughter. So yeah, not great. Oh, wow, sorry about that. Hey, did you check out that Spiceps thing? - Cool, huh? - Really? I thought so. Yeah. Since Mr. Dinkler is in the bathroom, crying, I'm stepping in to announce the science fair winners. Second lace goes to ""How Many Hairs Up There?"", by Andy and Ollie Pesto. - Oh, my God! I want to thank Ollie. - I want to thank Andy. I want to thank Ollie. I want to thank Andy. That got second? That's ridiculous. And the blue ribbon goes to ""Spice"" uh, I can't read this. Spice Rack! Spice Rack! Spiceps, Spiceps! Spice Rack! Spiceps! - Spiceps! - Ow! Rack! ? Electric love ? Electric love ? Electric love"
"Open up, babies. Time for breakfast. Who wants Mommy's sausage? None for me, thanks. No sausage? What's wrong, sweetie? Today's the day I'm going to ask Jimmy Jr. to the dance. I don't want sausage sweats. Why? I'm wearing my sausage sweats right now. Aw, my baby's going to her first school dance. It's not that big a deal. I never went to a school dance. What? You never went to a school dance? No, I had other things to do. Like what, Dad? Well, I did leather-tooling. I made a belt. Somebody change the subject, somebody change the subject! Hey, I'm fine with it. I didn't miss out on dances. Those other kids missed out on leather. Aw, Bobby. That's what I love about you: all your sad stories. It's not sad. Hush, you're scaring Tina. Put that out of your head before you ask Jimmy Jr. Happy thoughts, happy thoughts. Leather belts. Sausage. Sausage belts. That's a great idea. Hi, Jimmy Jr. Oh, hey, Tina. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? Hey, speaking of the dance, are you planning on going? Am I going to the dance? Does this answer your question? Pyeah! - Oh, that must be dancing for ""yes."" - Yeah. Then, would you like to go to the dance with me? Uh, the best I can do now is a maybe. I want to know what all my options are first. That makes sense. Yeah, it does. - Because, why tie yourself down now? - Yeah. You know, you want to know all the girls that might be interested - so you could weigh - Right. the pro weigh them against each other. Okay, see you later. Okay, bye. Hey, Tina. Yeah? Ch-ah. What's that dancing for? Just your skirt's stuck in your underwear. Oh, thanks for telling me. - All right, fix it. - Okay.   I'm gonna live forever  I'm gonna learn how to fly  Oh, my God. Tina? Josh? What are you doing here? I'm here for school. This is homework for my street performance class. - Wow. - I go to the performing arts high school. I dance ballet. Oh, a bad boy. Cool. Who's this? I hope she's not another Toe 'Ho. A what Douglas. A dance groupie. These hangers-on, they really sap your energy. No, Douglas, this is Tina. I never thought I'd see her again. Oh, great. Hey, hey, Josh. I have to do a minute of handstands for extra credit. Can you time me? No, I'm-I'm kind of busy right now. I guess I'll just time myself, then. One, two, three, - four, five, six - I haven't seen you since - Douglas, you got to stop, buddy, okay? - Okay. I'm so sorry, Tina. What were you saying? - I haven't seen you since - Since we kissed. On either side of the dairy case at Fresh Feed. It was hot. And cold. Why didn't you call me? No, I wrote down your number, but I put it in my dance pants and it got all sweaty. Dance pants. Yeah. - Never put anything down dance pants. - Mmm. Hey, I was just thinking, our school dance is Saturday. Will you come with me? Don't you want to know what your other options are? No, silly, I want to go with you. Well, that sounds fun, but my school dance is on Saturday, too, and today I got a soft maybe from a boy I asked. So I'll have to let you know? That's totally fair. Here's my number. Oops, I lost it. I know you're kidding. Yep, that's our chemistry. It sure is. Really cool chemistry, too. Douglas, please! Oh, I recognize that look. Somebody's going to the dance with Jimmy Jr. Yes, and it might be me. Jimmy Jr. gave me a maybe. All right! That's my little maybe baby. You're gonna be the prettiest girl at the dance, maybe. Just a maybe? When's he gonna give you a solid answer? Soon, I hope. Because Josh asked me to go to his school dance, too. Well, that's great. Go with the kid who's not stringing you along. Remember, Tina, a nerd in the hand is worth not really that much, actually. Never mind. A yes is better than a maybe, sweetie. Don't end up like your father. Uh, what? Don't end up like your father. I guess you're right. But, I've logged over 3,000 fantasy hours on my relationship with Jimmy Jr. You don't just throw that away. Bob's Burgers. Hello? We can do it? Yay. Oh, how exciting. No teens are gonna get pregnant on our watch. I'll see you Saturday. Uh, what was all that? Get ready to shake it, Bobby. We're gonna chaperone Tina's dance. Narc! Chaperone? That's a horrible idea. Dad, your first dance. We can get ready together. Yeah, you can zip each other up. Uh Hi, Jimmy Jr. I was wondering if you've decided who you're going to the dance with. Uh, no offense, Tina, but you're pressuring me right now, and guys don't like that. Well, then, maybe I'll go with the other boy who asked me. Wha? Another boy? Oh, uh I just decided. I'll go with you. Wait, you just decided you'll go with me because you found out this other boy wants to? That has nothing to do with it. Who is it? Lenny? No. I mean, he's good-looking, but he's not that good-looking. Plus, looks fade. It's not Lenny. Was it Nate? No. 'Cause he has herpes. - So you're saying you want to go with me? - Yes. And Josh wants to go with me. Choose me, Tina. I asked you first. But you asked me first. We've got chemistry. I've got a butt. Look at it. I asked you and only you. - As far as you know. - What? He said, ""As far as you know."" No, I didn't. You said it. Don't worry about who said it. Just watch the butt. Jimmy Jr., I just decided. I'm going to the dance with Josh. Well, would you at least think about changing your mind? As a handsome dancer once said, ""Maybe."" You're-you're the handsome dancer. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to hitch his trailer to the Tina truck, but now it's headed down the highway to Joshville. Honk, honk. Two boys like Tina at the same time? And one of them's not even papier-matcher, like Roberto was. What happened to Roberto? Did you try to shower with him? Yeah. Maybe. Well, good for you, Tina. When I see Jimmy Jr. at the dance on Saturday, I'm gonna tell him, ""Go do your 'you had your chance dance,' buddy."" Wait-wait a minute. Now we're chaperoning a dance Tina's not even going to? We're not doing it for her, Bobby. We're doing it for you. I really wish we weren't doing it for me. Oh, wake up, we do everything for you. Dad, if you believe you're beautiful, you will be. I did. But maybe we can do something about that hair. Did you wash it? Walk home with us, Tina. There's just something about your smell that keeps the mean dogs away. Not today. Josh is coming to pick me up. Tights. Tina, is he a superhero? Hey, Tina. Hey, Josh. So, I'm here to pick you up. - Whoa, careful! - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Get it? I literally picked you up. It was like being on a romantic stool. Yeah, well, that was just a stool sample. There's more where that came from. Ten bucks says you can't lift Gene. Toss me into a tree, then tell everyone I climbed it myself like a normal boy. Wait, wait, wait. Pick me up, pick me up. Here we go. - Put me down! Put me down! - Okay, now, now you're down! And now you're down. That was cool. Lifting a girl. Big deal. I'm sorry. You are? Better than you. And what? This is Jimmy Jr., the other boy who asked me to a dance. This is Josh, the other boy who asked me to a dance. I'm Zeke. I'm going stag. So you dance, huh? On those twigs? You just got J-Ju-ed. Whoa, guys, slow down. Is this really worth it? Come on, Tina. We've got reservations at a frozen yogurt stand. Ha, can't afford regular yogurt. I can't believe Tina found another dancer. She's rubbing that guy's feet in my face. Uh-oh. Somebody's as jealous as a bald guy in a mop factory. I'm not jealous, Zeke. I just don't! Like! That guy! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, now. You want her back, we'll get her back. You think so, Zeke? I don't know, but maybe. Well, you just said Oh, just trust me! Well, well Kind of. It's so hard when two boys want you. You seem to be kind of enjoying all this attention, Tina. Come on, Bob. Tina had a long wait till she got to the buffet. Let her pig out. I'm just saying, you shouldn't string boys along. It's not right. You can't just tell a boy on the steps of Buchanan Middle Schoo that you're not going to the dance with him when you said you would. Whoa. What happened, Bob? Yeah, Dad, open that wound. - Let's poke around in there. - All right, all right. I was 13, and I just spent my allowance on a corsage. - Idiot. - Hey, Becky. I got you this corsage. It goes really nice with your other corsage? Yeah, Curt gave it to me. Hey. Oh, hey, Curt. 'Sup? Sorry, I didn't know how to tell you. I thought this would be easiest. Yeah, yeah, this is, um this is really easy, Becky. Thanks. Oh, well. I'll see you inside. Great belt. Great neck. What'd you say? Uh nothing. Yeah, that's what I thought. Your fly's down. No, it isn't. Oh, got me. Yep. Is this stuff really important to the story, Dad? Aw, Bobby. That settles it. We're gonna make up for that awful, terrible night and all your other missed dances, Bobby. That's not why I told the story, Lin. This is gonna be the biggest, glitziest, Bobby-est school dance ever. And if there's a chaperone king, it's gonna be you. There's no such thing as a chaperone king. Well, there wasn't a raccoon king in our alley until I went out there and picked my favorite one. His name's Little King Trash Mouth. He's gay. He's gay? Yeah. Why? He's got a boyfriend. They just got married. Hmm. Wha? All right, J-Ju, get your net ready. We're about to hook us a trout called Tina. Hey, Tina. Hi, Jimmy Jr. What's up, girl? I got you! I got you! Come on! Uh-oh, J-Ju's starting to rally. Oh, he beat me. Oh, look at this boy. Look at that r-raging testosterone just throbbing out of him. Ah, yeah. How you like my boy now, lady? Ah, I got mad. My main man's a crazy man. I know what you're doing, Jimmy Jr. You're trying to get me to go to the dance with you. Well, try again. I mean it, try again. Um right now? No, later. Just do something without Zeke. Well, if that didn't work, nothing will. Sorry, J-Ju. - Now let's finish what we started! - No, Zeke! Ow! You little son of a bitch! Hey, guys has, um Tina been talking about me at all? Um, no. Tough break, Jr. Tough break. Hey, will you guys help me get her back? We'll help you, for a price. Can you really put a price on love? Yes, you can. It's $20. Okay, just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. Anything. Hey, but don't let Tina know. Jimmy Jr., please. We are professional and discreet. We would never tell her. Hey, Tina, Jimmy Jr. just hired us to help win you back. He did? That is the sleaziest, sneakiest, most romantic thing I've ever heard. Great. Can we quote you on that for our Web site? And could you make us a Web site? Operation Squash Josh a go. Take your positions. Hi, Tina. Wow, a horse. That's me, Jimmy Jr. What are you doing in there? Say, ""I love you more than hay!"" Say, ""I love you. Hey!"" I love hay. Oh, that's nice. 'Cause you're a horse. Say, ""Saddle up for love."" Satellite above! Seattle has drugs. Oh, that's where they have drugs. It's going great! Hit her with the song. Cue the tune, lover boy.  ""T"" is for the way  You take my breath away  ""I"" is for  The way I like it  When you take my breath away   ""N"" is for no one else takes my breath away   And ""A"" is for asthma  That is a disease  That takes people's breath away.  That was amazing. Score. You did it. Yeah. High-five all around. - This is going good. - Hey, Tina. - What's with the horse? - Jimmy Jr. dressed up like a horse to surprise me. Yeah, I know what Tina wants. And, oh, by the way, - I kissed her. - I kissed her, too. Well, I kissed her first. And you kissed her worst. Guys, you both have kissed me. It's true. And I appreciate you dressing up as the most magical non-magical animal there is. But I want to go to Josh's dance. With Josh. That's me. Ugh. When you tell me no, it makes me want you more! Oh, no. Aah! No. Aah! No. Aah! I thought you knew how to seduce your sister. Wait, that's what we're doing? Be patient. Come on, it takes extra time to get through those extra thick glasses. Plus she's a teenager and they're so fickle. Why do we have to get a stupid babysitter? What did I say about using that word? - You're not stupid, Jen. - I know. I brought this puzzle for the kids to do. Oh, look, it's nails all twisted up. I'm not saying it's unsolvable, but it's probably unsolvable. It's like the Ruben's Cube of nails. Yeah, that looks great, Jen. Oh-ho-ho Done! - Oh, my God. - What else you got? Uh we could look at my hand. One of my fingers I got it caught in a leaf blower. And so the knuckle didn't grow. Oh, look at the hand. Wow. That's great. Thank you. Ta-da. Oh, my God, it's like a fairy tale! What a couple of sexy beasts! Can we just go? Hi, Jen. Not before I get a picture, you can't. - Come on, you two, get together. - Hmm. Say, ""Romance."" Romance. Romance. Romance! Tina, your ride is here! And, uh oh, what's this, Bobby? Our ride is here, too! Look! I told the guy at the limo place your sad story, and he gave us a discount. I'm staying home. No, you're not. Come on, I want to stand up in the sun roof and yell bwah! Right? Yup.  I'm a little nervous. I know, there's a lot of talent in this room. Hey, remember to stretch, you two. Or else you might get hurt doing this Ha! Don't worry, Douglas. I won't be doing that. No, I know you won't, sweetheart. I like this song. So do I. Maybe we could like it on the dance floor. Just think of me as your Nutcracker. Sorry, that's the only ballet I know. What about the lipcracker? Is that a real ballet, or are you asking me to kiss? Both. JIMMY JR. Put the lips down! Jimmy Jr.? I came to fight for you, Tina. Like fight-fight? No. I'm challenging you to a dance-off! Oh, my God, a real dance-off! My idea. And you're welcome. A pants off? For me? Uh, no, a dance-off. Oh. That's almost as good. Do Mom and Dad know you're here? I didn't know what to do with them. They solved the puzzle. I didn't bring any backup puzzles. Yeah, we stared at a knuckle-less finger for about 20 minutes. Uh, Tina, eyes on me. - I'm winning you back. - Right, sorry. So You Think You Can Dance called. They said, ""You can't."" Oh! Did you, uh learn that joke at the School for Performing Farts? These are the best insults about dancing I ever heard! I don't ever want to leave this limo. Oh, come on, you little wallflower. I'm gonna pick you. Gonna pluck your little petals. - Da-da-da-du! - All right, I'm coming. Mr. and Mrs. Belcher. You are our best-dressed chaperones. Aw, thank you, Miss Jacobson. It's my Bobby's first dance. - Uh, first dance as a chaperone. - Oh. I've been to dances before. Of course. If you'll excuse me Hands where I can see 'em! Ooh, Miss Jacobson's a looker, isn't she? You're telling me. Why is she a teacher? She should be, like, playing a teacher on TV. All right. That's enough. I'm just saying, I just Yeah. She's, um - ridiculously attractive. - Enough! Guys, Jimmy Jr. called the dance-off, so he's gonna go first. No moves are forbidden, except ""The Forbidden Move""! Good luck to both of you. And don't be self-conscious if you start sweating a lot, and your shirt sticks to your chest and your abs. Thanks, Tina. Thanks, Tina. DJ? Cue up something that rocks! Yeah!  Okay, there. We danced, all right? I- I got the middle school dance experience I never had. Thank you, Lin. One dance? Bobby, you didn't even move your feet. You're still not getting into the spirit. Look, we have a responsibility. We're chaperones. I saw a kid lick another kid's eyeball. Seems like something we should get him in trouble for. Wait, wait, wait, wait, Bobby. Uh, I'm sorry I blew my lid - about Miss Jacobson. - Hey. Hi. Hi. Hi. It's fine. It's just, you know, she-she really is a hottie. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I bet if she asked you to dance, you'd take another spin. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? No. No. I No. I would not be interested. Go on, say it. Say you'd rather dance with her! I- I Wh I Say it! - This is for you! - There! Linda. What the hell? Cut the fog, man! Cut the fog! Yeah! Douglas, what do you think? Take it slow or go rough? Josh, you be as nasty as you need to be. Yes, nasty. DJ, my music. Wow, he looks like a lion murdering a cloud. I know. Isn't it beautiful? Linda? What's wrong with you? What are you doing in there? We just I'm talking to my girlfriends! Oh. Go away, Bob! You want to dance with Miss Jacobson! You think she's prettier than me. Yes, she's hot, but it doesn't matter. Who cares? Look, I-I'm going to go back out to the dance and pretend none of this is happening because you're acting like a middle schooler, Linda, and I am, uh Oh Gotcha! - So that was just so - So you could have a little drama. It's your middle school dance. What, did you think these things are fun? Come on. You are definitely nuts. But now you're more in the spirit, right? You got some more dance in your pants, don't you? - Ooh. Come on. - I don't. No. That I don't know. - Stop. - Come on, this might help right here. - I brought some schnapps. - Here? We'll get in trouble, Lin. That's right. That's bad. That is really bad. Oh, my Go oh, my God, it just got good. Look. You brought two? Double-fist it. Double-fist it. I'm not mixing peach and mint. Mmm. - And with great dignity, the swan - dies. Why did I not bring any roses to toss? I should always carry roses! This isn't over! Lightning round! DJ, kick it! Here I am. No, I'm not. Here I am. No, I'm not. Here I am. No, I'm not. Stop. Turn off the music. Someone's gonna get hurt. I can't choose. Maybe I don't have to choose. We can make this work. We'll come up with a make-out wheel. Kind of like a chore wheel. Uh, I don't want to do this. Yeah, me, neither. Give it a chance. Let's put the ""try"" in ""triangle."" Um, no, thanks. Talk to you later, okay? Tonight was really fun. Until all of this. This was a mess. Oh. Yeah, um, I kind of forgot what I was even doing here. Well, we have a draw, but we also have a loser. Which would, of course, be you, Tina. If you ever go back to being a one-boy girl, you know where to find me. And, hey, Jimmy Jr., you got some great moves. You thinking what I'm thinking? Let's do this. Oh, yeah, girl! We got ourselves a dance on! - Too bad, T. - I got greedy and grabby. But I had two boys fighting over me. I'm thankful for that. Sorry you weren't able to make Jimmy Jr. and Josh your sister-wives. Hey, maybe next dance. You flew too close to the buns. Watch the hands. Um, Mr. and Mrs. Belcher? Hi. I'm gonna have to ask you to tone it down a little bit. Oh, you mean tone it down like this? Whoop! - No. That is not what I mean. - Hmm. This is completely inappropriate behavior. Bobby's first dance! Oh, my God. Oh, Lin. Oh, the schnapps. - Oh, Lin. - Oh, it tastes like peach. Oh, man. That's all over me. Ah, I got to take my shirt off. I'm gonna - I'm gonna lose it, too! - Can I get a little help over here? - I'm gonna lose it! - All right, these two, out. Right here. Ooh, you're even prettier when you're angry, little lady. I got it! I got it! You're not security. You're friends with Tina. - Hey. Get your hands off me. - What? Hey! These two. - Get 'em out. - Get your hands off me, little guy.  ""T"" is for the way you take my breath away   ""I"" is for the way I like it when you take my breath away   ""N"" is for no one else takes my breath away   And ""A"" is for asthma that is a disease   That takes people's breath away!  Oh, that's nice. 'Cause you're a horse."

Well, tonight, Al and I are supposed - to go to a potluck, but, uh - Hey, we could all go. No! I mean, you don't want to go to that. Potluck? There's so many other fun things to do around here: - Mahjongg. - Yeah. - No. - Chinese checkers. - No. - Yeah, yeah. - Boccie. - Oh, boccie. No. - Backgammon. - No. - Mahjongg. - Oh. You said that. - I don't remember saying mahjongg. - You did, you said it first. Wine tasting. - That. Let's do that. As - Ooh, yay, wine. As soon as we can, right? Can we go taste wine now? Uh, I've never peed in an Olympic-size pool. I'm a little nervous about going for the gold. Relax, Gene. This is where all those years of training pay off. Mm. ""Closed for cleaning""? No! Okay, okay, okay, calm down, calm down. We can fill it. There's a drinking fountain. Okay, we just we need a bucket. Where are the buckets? Forget the bucket, just spit. My mouth's dry. Tina, give me some of your spit. - You missed. Try again. - Oh, no! No, no, no! Oh, no, no! Our trip is ruined. I used all my vacation days for this! Now what? I'm not gonna sit and watch the sunset or whatever these people do. I say we go to Cuba. We've got the floaties. I've always wanted to see the Bay Of Pigs. Sounds cute. Hey, look, it's the crazy leopard lady. ? My Bitsy - Wow, that's bewitching. - It's for my dead dog, Bitsy. He used to love the sound of this thing. - I used to love it, too. - How'd Bitsy die? - Python ate him. - There's pythons in Florida? They didn't mention that in the brochure. Oh, we got everything here. Pythons, panthers, predatory stink bugs. Yup, that's everything. How do you know your dog got eaten by a python? - Did it leave a note? - Two weeks ago, I saw my little Bitsy go into these woods. Then I saw the python in there. You do the math. Ah, no thanks. We're on vacation. You do the math. You do it. Wow, the red pairs nicely with the white. Look at all these active seniors. I can't wait to get old and move down here myself. Lin, there's something you should know. - Now don't get upset. - What? What happened? Uh, this place - is kind of special. - Fah. - I can see that. - The seniors are active. - Very active. - Yeah, I said that already. - I mean, like adventurous. - Uh. Yeah, okay. - Okay. - Ah. - I got one. - Ah Hmm? Oh, my God, Lin. These people are swingers. What, like-like dancers? - No. - No. Like golfers? - Uh-uh. - No. Yeah. Wha, wha, wha, wha, swi What? Huh? Oh. I'm sorry about Bitsy. Is this him? He was a snazzy dresser. - Wait, how big was this snake? - At least ten feet. Ten feet of snake? In there? Oh, he'd put the squeeze on you. Oh I told the condo association get rid of it. They don't believe me. But that snake's in there, and it's a killer, and I'm gonna prove it. That's why I got this. The only problem is, I don't walk so well. You kids could go in there. - I'll pay ya. - What?! No! Gene, let Helen speak. Well, what would you say to a $100? - Oh, my God! - No. - Yes. - Yes! But you've got to get it on there. No proof, no money. - No. - For a hundred bucks, - we will get that thing on tape. - No. - Cheating on his wife. - No. - Taking bribes. - No. - Uh, shoplifting from a snake mall. - No. - Uh, giving up on his dreams. - No. We're going to get it all! Since the first Burmese pythons were released in Florida, these voracious predators have spread from the panhandle to the Everglades. - So Helen's not crazy. - At least not about this. They eat rabbits, raccoons, small dogs, even deer. I'm too young to be an outline in a snake's belly! Gene, get a grip! We're talking about a hundred dollars. You once licked a slug for a bite of a granola bar. Slugs go well with granola! Don't worry, Gene. As long as we stick together, the snake can't swallow all of us. Speaking of sticking together, how about I don't go with you? I'll stay at base camp. I'll be the guy who's, uh good with computers. Call me Circuit Breaker. I'm not calling you that. I really think you should, because, um, I'm hacking into the mainframe. Oh, oh, encryption. Ha, ha. Right around ya. And, oh Activate spellcheck. Go. I'm in! What about those two? - Yes. - Wow. Ugh. How about, uh, Earlobes and uh, Back Hair? Don't tell me they're into it. You don't want to know how into it they are. That is unbelievable. Oh, it's not funny, Bob. It's gross. No, Lin, it's really funny. Ma, this is wh Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to live here? Because the other places were horrible! Old people waiting to die. This place, the people are alive. They're really alive. That's amazing. - Stop it! We thought, if swinging is part of it, why not give it a try? Then we moved here, and your father got cold feet. Good for your feet, Dad. Eh? It's not good! It's not good, Al! No! Can I have a graham cracker, Helen? Get your own. You know, we could become professional python bounty hunters. We could move here and start our own reality TV show. We could call it Snake It to the Limit. Or So You Think You Can Snake. Or Snake and Bake, if we baked the snake after we caught it. Hey, I'm paying you kids to track, not yak. Hey, don't get your tights in a bunch, Helen. We're gonna find that snake. See ya, Gene. Can I have some melon? No. There must be millions of places in here where that snake could hide. Okay, maybe not millions. Let's try that again. Florida's weird. What's going on? You just left. - Ugh. Let us work, Helen! - Then work! We're working! God! Ow. Ha! You missed! Yeah, you missed. Wait. Ugh. I don't want all these old horny toads anywhere near my parents. I can't believe they got mixed up in all this. Easy, Lin. Your parents are adults. It's really none of our business. I'm telling everybody when we get home. Ugh! I can't get the image out of my mind. A bunch of naked old people all in a yuck, naked. - Oh, hi, kids! - Hey. - All in a what? - Uh look, over there! - What? - I got you. Huh. Go to bed. All of you. Bed now. Actually, we were thinking we'd camp out tonight in the parking lot by the woods. Grandpa Al said we could use his tent. Huh? In the parking lot? Away from this? That's great! Yeah, great! But if anyone invites you to a potluck, run away. There's a potluck?! You would not like it. Really? What do you mean? It's hard to explain why you wouldn't like it. Well, give me some ideas. I love the idea of everyone bringing a dish. Oh, God! Don't do it while we're here, please! Ugh! Oh! Linda, we've been served with a Notice of Failure to Perform. What? Failure? W-Why? Wha? Your parents RSVP'd ""no"" to the potluck. It's clear they have no intention of taking part fully in the activities here. And those who don't play can't stay. - Eh. - They can't? Tonight's potluck was their third strike. They also missed the Best Ball golf outing and the South of the Border fish taco night. Ugh! Oh! Wait. So you're kicking them out for not going to your parties? You can do that? It's in our bylaws, large print edition. You've got to be part of the community. Well, these pots are keeping their lids on! Stay away from their beef and noodles! I'm going to bed. I hope you're better at finding snakes than pitching tents, because you stink. Well, I hope you're good at finding your purse and ponying up that hundred bucks. I got the money. Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah! - Yeah?! Let me see it! Hey, don't you worry. I'm good for it. Just put ten dollars in my hand. Good night. Good night, Helen. Sweet dreams, okay? I love you, Helen! And I love your money! Uh, it's getting dark. I better go in the tent and do base camp stuff. Oh, no! The tent's running away. Oh, get back here with base camp, Gene! I don't want to! Helen said she'll get you crackers! No, I didn't! Oh, go to bed, already! Don't you worry, Mom. I'm sure you and Dad can find a nice retirement community. One where a porch swing is something you sit on and not strap into. I sat on that. It was weird. We won't be able to afford to live in a retirement community. Or even an apartment. - What? Why? - Why? If we get kicked out, we'll have to forfeit our down payment. No. Well, you know what I'm thinking. No, no. You could always No, no, no. No. move in No, no. with us. No! What kind of animal was that? Stop being scared, okay? You're gonna spook Tina. I'm not spooked. What's the thing after spooked? I'm that. Wait, wait! Let's all stay in the tent. Let's order tent service! I'll get Ooh. Ooh, this is hard. I'll get the Cobb salad and What do you guys want? Okay, I'll just put you down for some spicy wings and, like, a dill salmon. What else? Guys! Guys! Shh! Did you say ""shh""? Or did the snake say ""sss""? What was that? Aah! Qu-Quit shining the light in my eyes! Whoops. I think something's on me. Is there something on me? Uh, yes. It's either a feather or a scorpion. Get it off! Tina, stop! Stop! I'll get it! No, no, no, no, no! Now I can't see the scorpion! Drop and roll! Drop and roll! Maybe it was a feather. Just think feather. I hate feathers. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, stop it. Oh, no. If they need a place to live they will live with us, Bob! - Case closed! - Well, why can't they live with your sister? - Her life is already ruined. - Gayle has a studio apartment. - We have three kids and one bathroom. - Not another word, Bob. If they get kicked out of here, then they are staying with us. Well, then they are not going to get kicked out of here. What? Bob, Excuse me. - Bob, where are you going? - Nowhere. What are you doing? Nothing. Bob. Sheesh. Bye. Snake-hunter to Snake-wuss. Over. Snake-wuss to Hey. We're lost, our flashlights are gone and we can't find our way out of the woods, which is possibly full of scorpions or feathers. Over. Follow the sound of my voice! It's on the walkie-talkie, Gene. Then follow your heart. You can't go wrong! Shush! Just shush! Tina, let's think. Is there such a thing as night butterflies? Please say yes. It could still be butterflies. No, they're not. - Hi, Al. - Eh. Looks like a pretty fun party. I mean, look, all you got to do is show up, right? And then they'll let you stay. Show up and and play. Well, yeah, but, you know, that's why you came here, right? I mean, you must have been excited about it at some point. What-what happened? I saw all these other fellas. - They're just a bunch of peacocks. - Mmm. Oh. Y- You don't want to be the last breadstick in the basket, huh? - Ah. - There's, uh breadstick pills, you know? Doc won't let me take those pills. Bad heart and kidney - liver - Right. And leg pains and dry mouth. W- Well, what else gets you going? Is there anything you're into? Like, uh - I don't know - uh, feet or something? Leather? - Spanking? - Eh. Um, I don't really know any others. Well, there's one thing. Gloria doesn't know. What? What-what is it? Eh. F-Forget it. You can tell me, Al. Balloons. - What? Balloons! Um, that's great. I Wait. What is that? I like to watch a woman inflate a balloon and then sit on it till it pops. It drives me cra-crazy. No, that's I mean, that's what you're into. Yeah, but Gloria hates loud noises. It'd never work. Uh, does it have to pop? Yes! Pop! Pop! Yes! What Where'd-where'd you see that first? World Wide Web. Uh-huh. Uh, I've I'll have to, um I'll check it out. - You just You just, uh www-dot - Mm-hmm. Women-inflates-a-balloon-and- sits-on-it-and-pops-it-dot-com. Yeah. Catchy name. How are we still in here? This is the tiniest forest in the world! All of a sudden I feel slower. And shorter. We're in a mud hole. That's it! I hate Florida! Gene, come help us! We're gonna drown in mud if the snake doesn't eat us first. I don't believe you. Send me a picture of you in the mud holding today's newspaper. Until you do, I am turning off the walkie-talkie. Gene, don't do it! Don't do it! He did it. You're dead to me, Gene! And we'll be dead, too, so it's complicated. - Help! - Help! Help! Help! ? I'm not afraid of ghosts ? I'm not afraid of sharks? ? I'm not afraid of cancer ? I'm just afraid of snakes? ? They really creep me out ? Where are their arms and legs?? ? It's not okay! I don't think Gene's coming. Less thinking, more screaming! Louder! I can't, but I'll add gestures. Oh, God! No wonder they had to clean the pool. Dirty old ducks. ? Dirty ducks Dirty ducks. ? Dirty ducks. Quack, quack. Hi, Gloria. Oh, sorry. Sorry to startle you. I know that's your thing. Okay. So, uh - so, what are you doing? Dishes? - Yeah. I guess I'm gonna have to pack this place up. Well, actually, maybe not. Guess who's been talking to Al about sex parties? - Who? - This guy. And guess who found out Al's secret kink that even you didn't know about? Who? Me. I did. Right here. - What is it? - Well, the answer may startle you. Literally. Do you have any earplugs or headphones? - And balloons? - Huh? And something to share, 'cause it's a potluck. So we should whip something up. What do you got in the fridge? Uh Can't hold on much longer. Tina, help me record my last will and testament. If you're watching this, I'm dead. And I only have a few things to say. Don't touch my stuff! No one gets anything! I leave it all to my ghost! What the hell is that? Gene, you came! Quick. Grab this. You saved us, Gene. I owe you my life. No, thanks. I've seen it, and I'm not impressed. Yellow Belly! Gene! Your belly's not as yellow as I thought. - What happened? - I didn't want to be an only child. They're always weird. Gene mowed us a path. Drive us out of here. I hate Florida. I hate Florida. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Wh. - Look. Bitsy's tutu. - Ah. Yeesh. This must be the place the snake comes to digest its prey. It's Bitsy! He passed right through the snake without being digested! Like that time I swallowed a button! This button. Where are my parents? Um, getting ready for the party. Wha? What is going on? What?! Go! Go, you two. Have fun. - Okay. - What?! Okay, bye! - Eh. - We're going now! - Bye-bye. - Thank you, Bob. No problem, Al. Oh, no. - I wasn't talking to you. Oh. Bob, you tell me what is happening right now. Al finally got into the swing of things. They're going to the party, which means they won't be kicked out, which means I'm a hero. Oh, you're a hero 'cause you got my parents to go to a sex party?! Well, maybe not a hero, but, uh, eh. Great, so they get to stay here and get passed around like hors d'oeuvres?! With crabs! In their crotches! Linda, look at them. Oh, my God. They haven't kissed each other in 20 years. Ooh, it shows. I'm sure they'll get better at it. Huh. I guess if you love something, you let it go swing. What's with the balloons? Oh, it's a long story. Actually, I kind of want to try something. Does this do anything for you? - Ooh! - Maybe Well, I guess the only python was in Helen's head. ""Snakes on a brain."" Am I right? Yes, you are correct! I can hardly wait to see the look on Helen's face when we reunite her with Bitsy. Oh, you again. What do you got? Get your purse out, Helen. Better yet, go to the bank and open up your safe we've got good news. You got the snake? Better. Bitsy! Oh, what happened to your clothes? Let's get you into your big-dog pants. Come back! - Bitsy! - Maybe he doesn't like wearing clothes. With that body, I wouldn't either. - Bitsy! - Oh, man. We're never gonna get our hundred bucks now. Bitsy! Bitsy seemed really happy in there, - if it makes you feel any better. - Oh, yeah? Uh, Bitsy! Whatever you want to do, I support you! Bitsy, listen! Your favorite! ? My little Bitsy baby ? Bitsy? Bitsy ? Bitsy? Oh, my Bitsy, baby ? Bitsy, I'm gonna miss ya, my Bitsy? ? Bitsy! - Bye! - Bye! Good-bye forever maybe! - Bye, Ma! - Bye, Dad! We'll never forget it. Can we come back sometime when they're not cleaning the pool? - No. Never. - Absolutely not. Not a chance in hell. Who were those people eating breakfast - with Gram and Gramps this morning? - Yeah. Oh, those were the Madisons. Well, why was Mr. Madison sitting on Gram-Gram's lap? She never lets us sit there. And I have asked. Honey, he's old. He-he thought she was a chair. Right, right. Um, you kids didn't see any of the party last night, did you? No, but we could hear it. Those people should learn to have a potluck without popping all those balloons. And without having really loud sex. ? I'm not afraid of ghosts ? I'm not afraid of sharks? ? I'm not afraid of cancer ? I'm just afraid of snakes? ? They really creep me out ? Where are their arms and legs?? ? It's not okay! ? I'm not afraid of ghosts ? I'm not afraid of sharks? ? I'm not afraid of cancer ? I'm just afraid of snakes? ? They really creep me out ? Where are their arms and legs?? ? It's not okay! ? Oh, my Bitsy, baby, Bitsy, I'm gonna miss ya.?"

Oh, great. Can't I just take my family to a stupid movie? Dog Prom 3D is not a stupid movie! Are we gonna just leave our car there like that? That's what we're gonna do when Dad and Mom break down. Leave them by the side of the road! Hey, guys, you want to see a live TV show taping? - Do I! - Give me that. ""Come to a taping of Family Fracas."" What's Family Fracas? It's a game show where they make families do weird stuff and then dump foam all over them. I'm into weird stuff and foam. Can we go? We should go home and call a tow truck.

It Water under the bridge, Bob. - Oh, good. - Dark, dirty water. - Under a horrible bridge. - Um Oh, but all is well now. You're looking at the new host of Family Fracas! Chuck, we got a problem. - The Morgan family just dropped out of the show. - Aah. Food poisoning. Gross! We got to find another family of five in the next ten minutes. But how the heck are we gonna do that? The heck right here. Yeah! We're a family of five. No, we're not. One, two, three, four. Oh, yes we are! Harry, this is a bad idea. No idea's a bad idea. I like this guy! I I don't know. Grand prize is a brand-new minivan. Dad, this is a no-brainer. - Dad, come on! - No, no. No, no, no. Bobby!

All right, let's get Frackin'! It's time for the Brain Drain! Well, it looks like these guys have lost their marbles. The first team to fill their brain with these wins the challenge. And what does the other team get? Foamed! That's right foamed. On your mark, get set, go! Are you trying to distract me by holding my hand? Huh, what? Owen, I feel it, too. But right now, we're competitors. I can't be sweet on you before I beat on you. Tina, marble me! Oh, right. Done! I ate it! I ate it! Num, num, num. I like it!

And Bob and Pat are gonna get dunked into a pit full of blue balls. The first one to find a yellow ball wins. But they have to grab the ball with their teeth. Families, you control the crane.

And now the Belchers are gonna spin the prize wheel for a chance to win a brand-new minivan! I got this. Come on, come on, come on, minivan. Oh, hey, a five-gallon bucket of Fracas foam, so you can get foamed at home. Home foam! No! Yes! It tastes good. Trust me. The Belchers will return tomorrow as the champs and have another shot at the minivan. Hey! We're coming back! That's exactly what I just said. Put your hands together for the winning family! You hear that? We're the winning family! Yes, they all hear that! I have a microphone. Congratulations to the most annoying winning family in Fracas history. - We won most annoying! Yeah! - Hi, Ma! You guys, this is so much better than the minivan. Mmm. Gene, stop eating that crap. You're just jealous that I have frothy diarrhea. Come on, you big idiot. ? La, la, la Hey, Jimmy, did you happen to catch Family Fracas last night? 'Cause we were on it, and we won. Oh yeah, is that the show where the most pathetic family wins? No, no. No, it isn't, Jimmy. Why don't you watch it tonight? I'll send you a shout out. Oh, yeah, why don't you watch this? Hey, I'm Bob! I'm on a game show! Blah, blah, blah! I I don't want to watch that.

You're not a real judge.? ? If anyone needs me, I'll be in my chambers.? ? It's not chambers. It's a dressing room!? I sentence you to kiss my ass! See this right here? - That's your punishment! - Oh, wouldn't you? Oh, you would love it. - Oh, you would love it. - You can just kiss it. Oh, I will do it. Somebody better kiss somebody's ass, or I'm gonna go crazy. Belchers and Changs are tied. Whoever wins the Human Claw takes the game. Good luck, Changs! And Belchers. But mostly Changs. And go! Yeah, Dad, grab those balls! - Yeah! - I got one! Oh! So sorry, Joe. Bob's little rat snout found the ball first, which means the Belchers win! All right! Did you just say rat snout? Let me at that wheel! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Foam again?! Uh, Chuck, can I give someone a shout out? - Absolutely not. - Jimmy Pesto's an idiot! The end. Tough shout out. Hmm.

Harry, please, please, please kick the Belchers off the show. You've asked me that every night this week. - And what do I say? - You say, ""Watch this,"" and then, you do that thing with your hands. That's right, Chuck. Watch this. - Oh, oh. Oh, yeah. - Oh, whoa. - Oh, oh, rounder. - Oh, oh, oh. Whoa! Where we going? Opposites. Yup. - Here comes a hand. - Ah, that's how you get me! You said they could be on one episode, but they keep coming back again and again. Look, it's part of the job. Richard Dawson used to kiss all the women on Family Feud. He didn't pick and choose. He just puckered up. Pucker up, Chuck. - No, seriously, pucker up. - Hmm. Hmm? Okay, come here. Practice on me. - I'm Dawson, you're me. Okay. - Mm-hmm. - You're Dawson, I'm me. - Okay. Mm-hmm. - Yeah, just like that. - Okay. - Now we're both Dawson. Double Dawson. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mmm. - Okay, are we good? - One more. Maybe someone else should spin the prize wheel tonight since Louise keeps landing on foam. Ooh! I thought you wanted five big buckets of foam! - No. - I wish you would have told me sooner, Tina! Don't worry. We'll beat the other family like we always do. And tonight, we win the van. I feel it. You're gonna feel your butt being spanked. That's what you're gonna feel. Jimmy?! You're on Family Fracas? Yup. I signed us up. Get ready to lose. I only count four Pestos and your bartender Trev. I told them he was the son I always wanted. - What? - Right on, Pops. Ha! Oh, I see you guys have met. Jimmy, you should just leave right now, because we're unbeatable. Jimmy Pesto! Oh, you're the guy Bob called an idiot on the air. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hmm. You hate Bob, I hate Bob. I like you. Jimmy Jr., you and I are friends and have been more than friends on one and a half occasions. If you say so. But tonight, we're competitors. I have to put aside my feelings for you. And destroy you. Whoa. You're being kind of intense, Tina. I know. I bring it. And go! Come on Gene and Tina! Brush! Tiny circles! Tiny circles! Come on, Jay Ju! I can't believe you made me care about this. Come on! Do it, Jimmy! Go! Hey, Jimmy Jr., you missed a spot. - On your face. - Quit it, Tina! T! Pick up the pace! Brush, brush, brush, brush! Done! Damn it! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You hit my eye! Here. Now we're twins again! - Done! - Yes! Oh, what's the point of having twins if they can't hit each other with eggs like they were supposed to? The Belchers and Pestos are neck and neck. It's anybody's game as we head into the Human Claw! Have fun losing, Jimmy. Well said, Jimmy. Ready, set, grab that ball! - We have a winner! - Huh? No! What just happened? We lost to the Pestos. We had a good run. And that's from a kid who hates running. I'm so sorry, Bob. The Pestos are the new champs of Family Fracas! Uh, can you lower me down now? We're trying! It's stuck, Bobby! Chuck, the crane is stuck. Bob, just a second. And the Pestos win a brand-new minivan! Oh! - Oh! Oh! - Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! - Pull! - Kids, stop. Don't do that. Stop! No, no, no! - Oh, boy. - Oh, Dad. Oh, that's too bad. Let's give the Belchers a big Family Fracas bye-bye! Bye-bye, Belchers! Bye! What? I'm saying good-bye. I know what you're all thinking not only did we lose to the Pestos but I also humiliated myself. Correct. I was thinking that. Well, you're right. I blew it. At least we have all this stupid foam. Aw, Bobby. I'm gonna get rid of this Fracas foam. I'm gonna flush it down the toilet. Bye. No! You can't! It's true. It says right there - you can't. - Oh. Hey, Dad, want a little good news? You're about to go viral. Stop! Oh, that's too bad. His pants come off every time. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for helping me get past this. No problem. How did Jimmy find that ball in two seconds? It's almost impossible. Bob, stop obsessing. It's over. This is the fifth time he's circled the block. Jimmy, I get it. You won the minivan. Face it, Bob. You were destined to lose. I knew it, Chuck sure knew it. Wh what do you mean, ""Chuck sure knew it""? What does that mean? What? Nothing. I I have a disease where I say things, you know, and it makes me drive away Hmm. We have a w We have a w Dad, if you watch the video in reverse your pants go back on. Thanks, Louise. I'm just watching Jimmy. It's like he knew exactly where to find the yellow ball. And I have a hunch Chuck told him where to look. Watch. - We - Did you see that? Yeah. Wait, what was I supposed to see? He barely fished for it. He cheated. We were wronged. Look, there are a lot of things - this family's terrible at. - That's true. We were really good at Family Fracas. And if we're gonna lose, I want to lose fair and square. Not because that jerk Pesto cheated. - Hey, Dad, can we put a pin in this? We're running late. - For what? For the Pesto's minivan. Jimmy Jr.'s having a screening of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights. What? No! Didn't you hear what I just said? That's the van of a cheater! What are we supposed to do, Dad? Watch the TV here? That thing makes me sick! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna drive down to the studio The car's broken, Dad! Damn it! I'm gonna walk to the studio and talk to those people face-to-face! You, you, not you - and you. - Tina, what are you doing here? - We're here for the screening. - Yeah, let us in. Let's do this. Come on. I don't know, Tina. You said some pretty mean things on Family Fracas yesterday. We'll take that popcorn though. - Thank you. - Jimmy Jr., wait! What you saw before was my game face. This is my normal face. Let us in! Oh, you're getting a banana in your tailpipe. - Oh - And I am not talking about the van. Oh! I think Jimmy Pesto cheated - at the Human Claw game. - Hmm. You do? Yes, and I I think Chuck might've helped him. Hmm Um, what's happening right now? Here's the thing, Bob. I believe you believe you were wronged. - Thank you? - This is big. Yes. And I could make it a lot bigger. Yes! Wait, what do you mean? I'm talking about Bob versus Chuck on Pam's Court. Um, no. I don't want to do that. How 'bout I just go to a real court with real lawyers? That costs serious dough. You don't have it. What makes you say that? Those stains, your smells, you walked here, your children, you're not wearing any jewelry. Aw, crap. All right, Pam's Court. - Let's do it. - All right! Congratulations, Bob. The Belchers are back on TV! You know what that rhymes with? - Uh - Long Island Iced Tea. I'm gonna have one. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You have a bar in your desk? You don't have a bar in your desk? I'm gonna leave you alone. Thank you. - Order. - This is the courtroom of Judge Pam. - I'll allow it. - And Judge Pam has the final word. Guilty. Not guilty. We'll see you in court. Judge Pam's court. I sentence you to stay tuned. In a very special episode of Pam's Court, burger man Bob Belcher is suing Jimmy Pesto and Pam's ex-husband and new host of Family Fracas, Chuck Charles. This is the case of the Great Balls of Ire. All rise. Pam's Court is now in session. You may be seated. So, someone else besides me is accusing Chuck of cheating. Mr. Belcher, you claim that Chuck helped Jimmy Pesto cheat at Family Fracas. Uh, yes, Your Honor. At the Human Claw game, which I happen to be pretty good at. Do you have any evidence to support your claim? Uh, yes, I do, Your Honor. Jimmy said Chuck, quote, ""sure knew I was gonna lose."" Now, I ask the court, how was Chuck so sure? Mr. Pesto, did you say this? Yeah. I said it. So he admits it! Yeah, I admit that you lost. And no one was surprised. Your Honor, the prosecution clearly has no case. I hate to agree with the defense, and also, I hate the defense and his smug face, and his misshapen penis. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Well, it pleased the court. The court was faking it. I don't think so. - You shut up. - No, you shut up. - Shut your mouth. - Shut your mouth. I will jump over there, - and shut it for you. - Edit that out. Do you have any other evidence, Mr. Belcher? You bet he does! You got something, right? - Come on, give it to 'em. - Actually, I I don't. I I thought, uh that when I said that one thing he would just confess. Bobby, that's all you got? Quick! Let's call a surprise witness! Who? I call Henry Kissinger to the stand! Order! I think I have my ruling. Will Bob's beef be settled? Lettuce find out after the break. Bob, we're gonna lose this case. Jimmy cheated, Lin. I know it. Hey, we're on TV. We know, Tina. We're on Pam's Court. Pretty neat, huh? It's a TV show. No, we're on that TV. Hi. Wait a sec. That's it! What? And we're back in three, two I went to my chambers and reviewed this case. Objection! You did not! You were here. You were putting on makeup the whole time. You don't even need makeup, on. - Oh, thank you. - You're beautiful. - And that robe - You're wonderful. I'd love to see you without makeup though to be honest. Moving on! In the case of Great Balls of Ire, I rule that Wait, Your Honor! I I have new evidence. I can prove my case. - Go on. - These cameras, they're always rolling. Right? - Correct. - A and the same with the cameras - on Family Fracas, right? - Uh-oh. One of those cameras may have caught Chuck helping Jimmy cheat. The Foam Cam! Dad, the Foam Cam is on the ceiling! I never forget a camera that feeds me. Objection! Objection! Hearsay! Inadmissible hears-say Overruled! Bring me the Foam Cam tape. Does this mean we're gonna win? - I sure hope so, Tina. - Good. Your ass is grass. And I'm gonna mow it. Leave me alone! Hey, so we can't show that tape. Oh, you did help Jimmy cheat. Yes. Yes! And I had to get rid of the Belchers. You gave me no choice. I put the ball in Jimmy's mouth. You put it in your mouth - and then you kissed it into his mouth. - What? No. I put it into his mouth with my hand. Huh. That's one way to do it. I'll take that. Ha! There's the evidence, idiot. Ha, you're the idiot. What do we do? I'm not gonna let the host of one of my shows lose a trial on another one of my shows. - Hey! What are you doing? - Whoops. Ah, Judge Pam, did you see that? Huh? See what? I saw it! The evidence must be on that tape. - Which means Dad was right. - Yes! What is going on with my lighter right now? It's burning this tape. What the hell? He's burning the tape! Pam? You know what to do. Right. Without any actual evidence, I have to rule in favor of the defense. - Yes! - Oh, yeah! Justice! What's going on? Why are we getting foamed? This is a court show. - The losers get foamed on Pam's Court. - That's insane. They have foam on all their shows on this channel. Oh, no friggin' way! I want my minivan! All right, you're gonna have to sit down. Down you go. I will kick you in the jaw. - I will - Just put my hand on your throat, and down you go. What're we gonna do now? Nothing. We lost. - But Jimmy and Chuck cheated. - Doesn't matter. We were never gonna win this case. This whole thing was fixed. Let's just go home and and never watch any shows on Channel 13 again! - Oh come on, you don't mean that. - Yes I do! I might watch a little bit of Pam's Court. Just a little bit. When are we getting the car back, Dad? I don't know. The mechanic called yesterday but I never called him back. I thought we were gonna win the minivan. - That van is dead to me! - Look, there it is. Oh, I love it so much. Oh, problem with the van, Jimmy? What? It's nothing. Damn it! You don't know how to change a tire. Ha! You don't know how to change a tire. Hey. Who am I? ""I can't change a tire and my whole family is watching me not be able to do something simple."" You are mean. - Yeah, Bob. - Geez, Dad. What? He's the one who said it to us when our car wouldn't start. - Yeah, but he was funny. - He was funnier? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - No. - Yeah. - No. Mm-hmm. No, he wasn't. He kind of was. Are you zll right, let me help. Move over. - ""Let me help. Move over."" - He just did it again! - ""He just did it again."" - He's doing it right now! ""He's doing it right now."" Oh, yeah, it's funny. Order. I'll allow it. Guilty. Not guilty. I think I have my ruling. Moving on. Right."

Why do I have to be on the toilet? - Fine, you can both be on the toilet. - And Dad went out for a pack of smokes and never came back. No, no, no. We're closing the restaurant and we're going to the hospital, all right? Kids, upstairs. Tina, you're babysitting. Countdown to babysitting. Excitement begins now. Four, three, two, one. Who's ready for some fun? I can't hear you. I'd be open to fun. Let's see here. We can play Torpedo, Surgery Sam, or if we need to blow off some steam, we can make a get-well card for Dad. ""Happy stitches, Dad. You deserve it."" Or how about, ""Stitch, please!"" Ugh, I don't want to make cards. I want to make money! I say we go down there, and we open up for business. Yeah.

Why did we ever think a restaurant was a good idea? We've watched Mom and Dad fail at it for years. They make failing look so easy. How do they do it?! But what if there was a restaurant that didn't serve any food and just served up gambling? I thought gambling was illegal. Not if no one sees you do it. No, I think it still is. But not if no one knows about it. I still think maybe we should We're doing it, Tina! - Okay. - Sorry. Hey, do you think this is broken? - Please, no. - Look what I can do with it.

I also noticed your friend over there giving you hand signals. Well, I'd like to introduce you to my friend. Zeke. You know what a purple nurple is? Yes. You can keep the money, friend. Or you can keep your nurple. But you can't keep both. Not my nurples! Now get out of here! Scram! Nothing to see here, folks! Tina! Drinks over here. On the house, whatever they want. What do you want? Why are you crying? I lost my allowance. No tears at the Meatgrinder just fun! Well, well, well. I came in to use the bathroom, and what do I find? An underground casino. That's actually underground. Who owns this building? Oh, yes, that's right. I do. Who's in charge here? - Uh - Uh We are a group of entrepreneurs, but it was my idea. You are in very big trouble, young lady. Because I am a gambling man. One hundred dollars on Surgery Sam. Let's play. Yes! The Meatgrinder is about to grind up a whale. Hold up, I got to metal-detect you. Beepity-beep, beep, beep, beep-beep-beep. All right, you're good. Go on in. Look. I love Misty Gish, but she's not ready to sing lead. Dottie Minerva is a star, and it's time for that star to shine.  Girls being girls being girls being girls  Oh, my God, oh, my God you're even worse than Misty Gish. Gene, I could give it a try. Girl Number Three, you're a backup singer. You don't even have a name. But I guess you'll have to do for now you're up. Cue the music.  Girls being girls being  Girls being girls Wow, she's amazing. I'm gonna make that girl a star. And my wife. Girl Number Three Belcher. Oh, damn it. Sam, why would you eat a car? Well, another hundred dollars to the house. Oh, nice try, Mr. Fischoeder. You'll get 'em next time. You think? Yeah, oh, yeah. - Eh, okay. - Your luck's got to change sometime, buddy. Ooh Rock, Paper, Scissors. Or as it was known in ancient China Huo-zhi tou. Oh, yeah, you like Rock, Paper, Scissors? You want to play that? Hundred dollar bet. Uh Go ahead. American rules. - Throw on the four count ready? - Mm.

Okay, okay, I'm jumping in here. New dealer, new hand get out of here. What'd I do? - Well, that should do it. - Oh, my God. I think I passed out. What happened? Oh, I just, uh, fixed up the old finger crotch cut. Why is my whole arm bandaged? I thought I'd just kill the roll, you know? Did you shave my arm? Uh, yeah. Why did he shave my arm? He shaved your arm. Why did he shave my arm, Lin? Because he's a doctor. What happened when I passed out? Bob, nothing. It's all on video. Wait, what's on video? We filmed it it's his first patient. All right, I'm getting out of here. His mom wanted to see it. She-she really appreciates it. My other arm is shaved! Mm-hmm. Why'd you shave my body?! He's looking for other cuts. Lin, we're going. All right bye. - One, two, three - You're about to throw - shoot! Aah! - rock! How did you know that? Get out of my head! Come on, give me some more. What do you got? Give it to me. We're out of money? - I take IOUs. - Great! - Play again? - Yes. All right, we're on in five. You know the drill. Girl Number Three, you're our new number one! Um, we were talking, Gene, and we've decided that the Cutie Patooties are breaking up. Breaking up? But this was just the beginning. I was gonna get you an MP3 deal and your own perfume. Patoot smells like girl farts. Yeah, well, I'm leaving the business to focus on my glitter stickers. And I want to spend more time at home with my pets. And I'm learning how to French braid. When I met you, you were eating lunch at school. So? So, see you tomorrow at lunch at school. I don't need them. I can be a girl group all by myself. I certainly have the passion. Two, three, shoot. Two, three, shoot! Aah! Another win. I should gamble against children more often. Louise, I think we're losing a lot of money. Oh, really? I know we're losing a lot of money! I feel it! Hopefully we can still make it home for the dinner rush. Seems like blood shouldn't be able to get through all this. Stop messing with it, Bobby. This isn't I know he didn't do it right. Leave it alone. I'm just gonna take a quick peek. Bobby, I said aah! Ooh! Oh, my God! Aah, aah! Oh, my God! Oh, God, look at it! It went in my mouth! Oh, I swallowed your blood. I've swallowed your blood. Oh, I'm gonna faint. I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up. What? Oh, we need to go back to the hospital. No. Hey, it's you guys. Are there any other doctors here? I can't tell you that. It's doctor-doctor confidentiality. There's no such thing. I can't talk about it but there is. No, there's not. I'll-I'll take a nurse. You want that for here or to go? I don't get it. Sorry, that that usually kills. Okay, I'll go get the nurse. Just don't tell her I said that.  Girls being girls being girls being girls   Girl group, shut your mouth. Thank you, Meatgrinder. Tip your waitress I'm friends with her dad. Hmm. One, two, three One, two, three - shoot! - shoot! - Yes! - No! Kids, we're home! Look at your father's arms. They shaved me. He looks like a turkey. Lin, wash your face, please. I'm gonna faint again. Oh, come on. Look at me blah! - Oh, my God. - Kids! Come look at my bloody face. Tina? Gene? Louise? Anybody here? Underground casino? Coat off. Game on. Well I think it's time to cash out. Where should I, uh, to whom do I, uh? Just one more game. No - Come on! - If there's one thing I learned from that week I was married, it's when to walk away. What the hell is going on here? Yeah, what is going on here? - Uh-oh. - Louise, these two snuck in somehow. Like some kind of ninjas. Hi, Mom and Dad, whoa, you're back. - Bob. - Mr. Fischoeder? Perfect timing. I was just about to, uh, collect my winnings. Your winnings? Yes, the house owes me some money. And I believe you are the house. Oh, my God. Uh, how much does ""the house"" owe you? $5,000. What?! Congratulations, sir. Sorry, Dad, it's my job. Oh, hey, Marshmallow. What is this? Wha-What's going on here? Well, it's an underground casino. You kids are supposed to be upstairs. Well, there's no room for a casino upstairs. What are you doing with Mommy's crackers? Got to keep the players happy. Flirt a little, wink a little. Sorry to interrupt, Belcher family, but, um, there seems to be a certain unresolved matter of my $5,000. Mr. Fischoeder, you can't expect me to pay you. I mean, they're just kids playing pretend casino. Why can't you play like normal kids? Why can't you bleed like a normal dad? A bet is a bet, Bob. I once lost $30,000 on a horse. She just ran off with it. Listen, I-I can't afford this, Mr. Fischoeder. Well, I'll just raise your rent by a thousand dollars a month for five months. Dad, a word in private? No. Family meeting, huh? Mom, family meeting? No. Ooh, family meeting. Excuse us a second, Mr. Fischoeder. Certainly. We could play him double or nothing. What? No. We're already in the hole. I'm not gonna owe him $10,000. Dad, I can't beat him, but you can. With that. This why would I play him with this? My hand's stitched. Plus, I'm not even left-handed. Exactly if you use that hand, he'll think you can't throw scissors. And that's why you're gonna throw scissors. But I really can't. My fingers won't separate. Yeah, keep saying that. We need him to think you think that. No, Louise, I can't actually do it. Great, so you know what you have to do. Oh, my God. That's my girl. That's my little mind-gamer. My little ""Amarosa."" But what if Mr. Fischoeder knows that we think that he thinks that Dad can't throw scissors? Or what if he thinks that we know that he thinks that? Or what if he thinks? Any outcome is possible, Tina, life is chaos! Gene, why are you wearing that? I'm just a girl with a dream who got tired of hearing the word no! Uh, hello, Belchers time is money, - and I believe it's pay me o'clock. - I'm gonna play him. Bobby, are you sure? That's a lot of money. We don't have any other choice, Lin. He's gonna raise the rent I have to. Bobby, your finger crotch looks like a '70s porno. Mr. Fischoeder, we have a proposition. Wonderful. - You and me - Hmm. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Double or nothing. Oh, I like this. One match for all the beans. If I lose, you owe me nothing. If I win, you pay me $10,000. Double or nothing, that's also my approach to underpants. Shall we dance? ALL Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors. - One - Rock, Paper, Scissors. - two - Rock, Paper, Scissors. - three - Rock, Paper, Scissors. shoot! No! Oh, you did it, Bobby! I misread you, Bob. Didn't think could throw scissors with that hand. I thought you were a little bit of a - a wussy. - Told you, Dad. I got you out of this. No, you got me into this. And out of it. - In, in, in, in, - Out, out, out, out, - in, in, in. - out, out, out. - Stop. - Out. Well, I guess we're even. Or we run it back double the double. - 20 grand, one throw let's do this. - I'm game. You've got a hot hand, Dad, use it. Yeah, keep the luck going, Meryl Streak. No, no, this is over. No more gambling. So we're not in trouble anymore? Of course you're in trouble. Could you point that in another direction? Sorry. Eh, it's all right. That's crazy stream of blood. That's a lot of blood Pass out if we're not in trouble. You're not in trouble mmm. Yay! All right, kids, help me get him in the car. We're going back to the hospital. Yay! Hit it. Oh, he did.  When Bob sees blood  And screams and passes out  Then Mr. Fisch checks in and cashes out   What more do you want  When kids run the restaurant?  Hey, sailor. Ooh, nice pants.  Marshmallow played a game of Surgery Sam   And all this 'cause Bob cut his hand   What more do you want  When kids run the restaurant?"
"I'm mining the cave for love  Don't care about the world above   Down here it's dark and cold  I'm just looking for a nugget of gold   My hat is hard but my heart is soft   It's dusty down here and so I cough   It's a dirty job but I ain't stoppin'   I know I'm breathin' toxins but you're lookin' foxin'   Will you be mine?  Coal mine  Will you be mine?  Diamond Hey, I was watching that. Bad enough I'm being forced to go to their concert. It's like I'm going to the electric chair and you're making me watch videos of the electric chair. Louise, you be nice. Your Aunt Gayle got you those tickets and she's excited to take you. I'm super excited. I've been practicing my concert scream all week. Ah Ah Still ne might need some work. Why would you waste a scream on a stupid boy band? Screams are for roller coasters or axe murderers or Dad's morning breath. Hey, it's not that bad. Oh, whew! Brush your teeth. I did. Well, then, help me look for my keys. I've told you to stop putting stuff in there if you ever want to see it again. You put my baby brother in there and that was the last we saw of him! Javier Belcher, I love you! I'm serious. We're gonna be late for Gene's table-setting competition. Ugh. Do I really have to? I- I'd rather go to the boy band concert. Bob, one of our kids is actually participating in something. We're going, even if it's table-setting. It's table-scaping. And it's the most exciting competition on four legs. It combines accurate table-setting placement with creative themes and costumes. I'm sure it's much more exciting than it sounds. It has to be. Right? Gene, how did you even end up going to the regionals in table-setting, anyway? It was the only non-athletic after-school activity, and I creamed the competition. As you can see, my tablecloth is a trash bag. Mm-hmm. Please enjoy this gar-beverage. Amusing. And when the meal is over, you can deposit your dirty silverware in the truck to head to the dump. Beep! Beep! Our theme is twin dinner. Twinner! Two knives. Two forks. Two napkins. Two plates Congratulations, Gene. You're going to regionals. All right! Mmm. Gene, if you like setting tables so much, why don't you set tables at the restaurant? Or here? No, Dad. I don't set where I eat. Where's Aunt Gayle? It's my first concert. I want to hurry up and start remembering this moment for the rest of my life. Maybe Aunt Gayle realized that she's a 42-yeldaroman and she shouldn't be into boy bands? Hello? Hi, Aunt Gayle. Are you outside? An emergency? Emergency? Okay, yeah I- I understand. Bye. Give me the bad news. Give me the bad news! Aunt Gayle pepper-sprayed one of her cats because she thought he was an intruder trying to sexually assault her. She has to take him to the vet and we have to miss the concert. Yeah! This is the best thing Aunt Gayle's done since she pooped her pants at the cell phone store last year. Ugh, my heart just pooped its pants. Wow. Lots of people. I didn't realize that table-setting was such a big deal. 'Scaping! Check out those trophies. Ooh, and judges with buttons that say ""judge."" Well, got to get cracking if I'm gonna win first place. You know, honey, it's okay if you don't win. Yeah, Gene, I mean, win or lose, we're just proud that you're setting a table at the competitive level. Ooh, mini croissants! No matter what I say, stop me when I've had 16. So, now that we're not going to the concert, what should we do first? All right, I'll give it a shot. Is this it? Yeah, that's good. Okay! I hate this. Come on, Tina, cheer up. It's four lame boys who dance. There's so much more out there in the world. No, there isn't! Ugh, it's no fun having you down if I'm not the one who got you there. I'm sorry. Fine. I'm not a monster. I'll help you. What do you mean? I mean I'll get you to the concert. - I'll get you there. - How? Are you sure we can bike all the way there by the time the concert starts? Not if we keep chitchatting like this. Oh, here's the freeway. Once we merge, get in the fast lane, okay? And we'll get there in no time. What? Zeke? What are you doing here? Me and my cousin Leslie are going to sell some bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs at the Boyz 4 Now concert. Boom. Whatcha letcha. Ha! Check it out. One size fits all. Damn, this one says my card's declined, too. Zeke, you have any money? Nah, my white ass is broke. Hey, I've got gas money. You got room for two more in that buggy? You slip me a fiver, I'll be your driver. Leslie loves rhymes. And pasta that comes in cans. If it ain't from a can, it don't go in this man. I've never ridden with this many hot dogs before. A day of firsts. Watch out. You squish 'em, you bought 'em. Boyz 4 Now, here we come. Don't squish it! So who's your favorite Boy 4 Now? Griffin's the hot one. And he's super extreme. His dog is a wolf. Stop. And then there's Allen. He's cute but shy. His fans are called Allen-coholics. Ugh. My stepmom's an Allen-coholic. And a shopaholic. Double trouble! This is Matt. He's moody and a little older. I think, like, 17. Maybe his mustache is 17, but he's 90. And then there's Boo Boo. He's young but crazy good at dancing. I used to be a real Boo Boo Booster, but now I'm kind of into Griffin. Ugh, stop talking! Stop. Stop. - Okay, I'm gonna put my fist in your mouth. - Okay. Oh, Marilyn. Tragic beauty. I love your son's table. Hi. Aw. Thank you. Magic. Hmm. Uh, what's ""hmm""? Your table's cute. But only one person can take home the Golden Plate. And we sure didn't come to take home the Silver Spoon. Yeah, well, we ne neither did we. - Right. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah! Oh, please. Come on, Oscar. You've still got a crying Joe DiMaggio to carve out of butter. - Bye, guys. Good luck. - Don't talk to them! Gene, get back to work on your table. You've got to win. I thought you said it was okay if I didn't win. Well, that was before we met that idiot. Now, chop-chop. Ooh, Dad, you got the fever! 'Scaping fever! Whoo! Can't escape the 'scape! Let's do this! Yeah! Ugh, no wonder no one likes women. All right, see you after the show. Be careful. There's a lot of puberty in there. I can't believe I'm here. It's really happening. I feel light-headed. Whoa! No fainting! I don't think I'm strong enough to go in there alone. I need you to come with me. Fine. I'll get you to your seat so you don't get trampled, but then I am out of there. What is wrong with all of you? They're just boys! Boys? Where? Oh, come on. Hello, young man. What can you tell me about your table? Oh, well Wait, what's that behind your ear? Is this your place card? Oh! Oh, my! Now, please, take your seat. Allow me to put your napkin on your lap. Ah? Very clever. Oh, I seem to have forgotten my centerpiece. Or did I? Eh? And what menu would you serve with this setting? For the entrÃ©e, you'll pull a roasted rabbit out of your top hat plate. Served with abracadab-braised potatoes and ice cream shazamwiches for dessert! Oh! She's smiling. I think it's going well. He looks good. He looks loose. I'm pleased to announce our four finalists: Melissa Brown, Oscar Anthony I did it! I did it! Heather Smith and Gene Belcher. - Yay! - Yay! Wait, why are there four winners? Finalists, please report to your table and begin assembling your second original display. Second display? If you thought our first table was good, which you did No, we didn't. just wait until you see our second one. I don't want to give anything away, but we're about to take a rocket ship out of this world. So it's space-themed? I can't say. Well, it is. You just basically said it. - I'll never tell. - Plus, I didn't think your first table was good. I graciously disrespect your answer. Well, wait till you see what we got, okay? I'm busy then. Well, you're gonna have to look at it if you're here. I'm double-parked. Okay, finalists. On your mark, get set, set. All right, Gene, what have you got? It better be bigger and more impressive than outer space. Or Marilyn in space. Marilyn in space. I didn't know there was supposed to be a second display. - What?! - Uh Did you read the rules, Gene? No! There were 16 pages. I only got up to the part that said no open-toed shoes. What are we gonna do? We can't lose. We've come too far. Come too far? Come too far?! We haven't come too far, Lin! We're just getting started! - Okay, so what are we gonna do?! - Why am I talking like this?! - I don't know! Why am I tal - I think I'm excited! - Oh, God! - This is weird! We got to win it! - Let's win it! - What? I'm wearing open-toed shoes. Ah, shoot. Boyz 4 Now! Boyz 4 Now! Boyz 4 Now! Okay, Teen, I think you're all set. Um, I'm gonna get out of here.

Uh-oh. Sky Grandpa! And Boo Boo! This is terrible. Who let all these pretty girls in here?  I want to hear your secrets   I'm so interested in you  Boo Boo! Oh, my God, who the frig am I?!  Will you be mine? Coal mine You're gonna miss Allen's poetry solo. You do not like a boy. You do not like a boy! Especially a boy named Boo Boo. Aw. Aah! Stop it! Oh, God! Get a hold of yourself! Aah! No! Ah, Boo Boo's so cute. Cute? He's the reason faces were invented, you idiot!  I need to show you a secret  It's gonna be a surprise  Come a little bit closer  Let me whisper in your eyes  When I whisper in your eyes  Don't think, don't blink Hey, girl, shh. Shush. Close your lips and open your eyes. I want your eyes to hear my lips and also my eyes Oh, my God! Tina. Tina! I thought you were leaving. Change of plans. I need to talk to you. I have questions. Tell me about the band again. - But in the car, you didn't want to - Tell me! Well, Allen Next! - Um, Griffin's - Yeah, sure, Griffin, Griffin. Uh-huh-huh. Next! Okay, Matt Next! Well, that leaves Boo Boo. Oh, really? That's interesting. Tell me more. What about Boo Boo? Boo Boo's the youngest. And he's got a really great voice, but he hasn't hit puberty yet, so that could change. What's he into? Sports? I could get into sports. What the hell else does he like? I want to give him things. Whoa, Louise. You like Boo Boo? What?! No, Tina, that's Okay, right, like, I like a boy. That's Ugh! Do you think he might like me? Oh, my God, what's happened to me?! Cut me open! I'm infected! Pull it out! It's okay, Louise. You're just having a crush. Never! Boo Boo! Oh, my God, you are sick, Louise Belcher. You are sick! I'm going to get you through this. Tell me what you like about Boo Boo. Nothing. Everything. I don't know. Do you like his hair? You mean those soft blond bangs you want to hide under like an umbrella on a rainy day? No, not really. And his face? Ew, gross, it's so gorgeous! I just want to slap it. I want to slap it. I just want to slap his hideous, beautiful face. Um, you mean kiss? No, I mean slap. Whoa. You got it bad, girl. Okay, I read the rules. It says here you can use anything you brought with you. So brainstorm. Go. Hmm hmm-hmm-hmm. Oh, I got it! We could shave Dad, glue his hair to the table, and the theme could be ""That's Nasty."" Let's steal another kid's display. What?! Bob, no. Okay, not that. We don't have to cheat. But we have to win, by probably not cheating. Oh, ew, Bob, your breath. Take a mint. You can smell it all the way over there? I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe I'm dying. That's it! Mom's purse. Dump it out! Yeah, Lin, there's got to be all sorts of stuff in there. - Let's take a look. - All right, dump it. That's where all my wadded tissues went. Start making piles of stuff that could go together. Eh okay, I got one. Lipstick, pepper spray, tiny bag of carrots. What's the theme? Uh, ""Woman of the Night."" She gets dressed up, she kills a john, she has a snack. Uh, let's keep making piles.  Tell me  About every single time you've cried   The first time  Oh, when your goldfish died. This is amazing. Eight encores. They usually only do seven. Shut up! Why would you talk during a song? Please be quiet, Tina. What? They can't be done. I'm not done! Where are they going? Backstage. They probably have backstage passes. Uh, let's go do that. But we don't have passes. Tina, did you learn nothing from the Boyz 4 Now song, ""Girl, You Don't Need a Backstage Pass""? Wish kid, fatal strep throat, coming through. Nope. I'm detective Brenda Lee Johnson. There's been a murder backstage. No one gets through the door. Look, I get it. I'd love to let you back there. I can see the pain in your face. That pain doesn't go away; It only gets worse. Don't get older. Hot dogs. No, no, wait. Oh, yep, yep, this one's hot. We're ready to go, Zeke. Where's Leslie? He's using his shirt money to buy an endangered box turtle from the tour bus driver. Tour bus? But whatever you do, don't feed him after midnight. Just kidding. He doesn't know what time it is. What is he, wearing a watch? Hey, cuz. Look who just joined the family. He lives in a shell and he's cute as hell. Cool. Hey, bus driver, what other endangered animals you got in there? Well, I got an African egg frog. I got a horseshoe bat. Got a skink and a skunk. Got a bush baby - How much you want for that bush baby? - Not for sale. - Come on. - But buy the skink, I'll throw in the skunk. I want Griffin to sign the inside of my eyelids, so he's the last thing I see before I go to bed. What are you going to ask Boo Boo to sign? Oh, no, Tina. I don't want Boo Boo's signature. I told you, I want to slap him. I don't know if he'll like that. That's why it has to be a surprise attack. We need to find some place to burst out of. In there? Uh, great idea, but just in case we aren't six inches tall, how about in there? - Ah, smells horrible in here. - Yeah. It would be terrible if these smells got stuck to the inside of my nostrils and I would have to smell this sweaty sweatband forever. I think they're coming. I'll slap Boo Boo in the face, and we'll be on our way. Crush crushed. Whew. Great show, guys. Yeah. We caused a lot of smiles tonight. Totally. Settle in guys. We've got an overnighter. I think we're moving. Oh, my God. We're going on tour. Slapabama, here we come. Should we jump out now? What's the protocol in this situation? Maybe you shouldn't rush into this, Louise. We could just live in here forever. All right, Boo Boo. We got to strap you into your booster seat. No! I don't wanna! When you hit 80 pounds, you can sit in a big boy seat. No! Guys, why don't you sing the song?  Gettin' into your booster seat   From your big boy head to your big boy feet   Gettin' into your booster seat  What the hell is going on? I don't know. Is ""booster seat"" code for drugs?  From my big boy head to my big boy feet  Boo Boo! Ah! It's a girl! A girl saw me in my booster seat! Don't look at me! - Stop the bus, Jody. - No, Jody, don't stop the bus. Who said that? No one. You were just thinking it. - We got another one in the hamper. - Stopping the bus. Hi. I'm Tina, your new roadie. Do I have something on my face? Just kidding. I know it's five sweatbands. We'll let you off at this rest stop up ahead. Hey, use the phone. Call your parents. They're probably worried about you. I know I'd be worried about my daughter. If I had one. But I'm 17, so I don't. Wait. Before we go, Boo Boo, my sister wants to ask you something. What? What? It sounded like What? What? What are you saying? What? What? Get me out of this thing! I'm trying to talk to a fan. Give me just a little dignity. Thank you. Now, what was that, little girl? - Bold. - Worth it. I think we nailed it. Yeah. It's daring, it's different. Nobody else is doing this. I'll just put a little more of this strawberry jam from Mom's purse and - done. - Ugh. Look at their table. Nerd alert. - Am I right? - Yeah. You lose. You guys, we didn't give up like we usually do, and I think it really paid off. I'm proud of us. All right, here comes the judge. Good luck, Gene. Go get 'em, Gene Bean. Yeah! Eh? Oh, good Lord. Welcome to my ""Menstru-rant."" I thought we decided on ""Period Piece."" Hope you brought your appetite, and your hot flashes. Okay, I think I've seen enough. As you'll see, beside the plate is a sanitary napkin. May I place it on your lap in case there's a big spill? No. I Please, let me. Get away. It's got wings. - Show her the tampon straw. - No. I don't want to see the tampon straw. Someone's on the rag. Well, at least those two got creamed, too. Oh, God Dad, do I have to do this again? Yes. Them losing is like us winning. Yeah, and we got fourth place. I mean, I don't think any of our kids have gotten fourth place in anything. I'm number four! I'm number four! Ooh, I got an idea for next year. - Baby Jessica stuck in a well. - Yes! You have to look for your dinner for two days as the nation watches. Thanks for coming to get us, Aunt Gayle. It was the least I could do. The good news is my cat is going to be fine. He just has to wear goggles from now on in case it happens again. Tina, if that's what your life is like, God, how are you even alive? What do you mean? You have a crush on almost every boy you know. How do you do it? Feeling that way for three hours was way too much for me. I'm no hero. I put my bra on one boob at a time like everyone else. Well, the good news is that now that I got it out of my system, I'm done having crushes forever. I hope for your sake you're right. But if not, you know where I live. You're a strong woman, Tina. I know. Good night, Tina. Night, Mom. Night, Louise. Did you guys have fun today? Pretty dull. Aw. Ugh. Disgusting. I hate you so freaking much, you idiot. Slap.  I want to hear your secrets  I'm so interested in you  What did you have for lunch today?   Tell me breakfast, too  Which friend are you mad at, girl?   What size are your shoes?  You just went to the bathroom, number one or number two?   I want to know everything, everything about you   I want to hear your secrets  I'm so interested in you  Even if it's not a secret  Tell me that stuff, too  Details, I want to know details   What's your dad's name?  Details, details   And your mom's  Any allergies?  Details   How was prom?  Interesting, so interesting."
"You look adorable. Ah, all ready for your big field trip to the museum. You happy now? Very thank you for volunteering to volunteer. Yeah, so we're even. Well, I've been a parent volunteer for eight years, and this is the first time you're doing it, but, yeah, fine, we're even. Great so, how did you survive eight years of being stuck with Mr. Frond? - Wine Thermos. - Hmm. Get a cyanide Thermos since you're gonna want to kill yourself because field trips are dumb! I agree field trips are dumb. I remember being a kid, going to the zoo, and sneaking off with Warren Fitzgerald. We smoked cigarettes in front of the zebras. Half-smoked. I didn't really smoke. Start your story over I just got here. Aw, you didn't care about seeing the animals? It was a pretty crappy zoo. Yeah, it's a pretty crappy museum, too. And we go there every year. I like it. Me, too. The Sands from Exotic Lands exhibit is my favorite. Last year when I got home, there was sand in my crack. It was hands-on learning for my butt. I bet we all have a good Sands from Exotic Lands story. I'm already bored. Hey, sometimes good things come from boredom. Like Gene. Thank you. And Tina. Pow. Okay, people, take a look at my buddy board and find your randomly assigned buddy. Okay, oh, uh, wait, wait. Hey, hey. Oh, look, Andy and Ollie got assigned to each other. What are the odds? - Yay! - Yay! And I got Me. I got a Genie in a bottle. Hey, if I rub you, will you give me a wish? - No. - Hey, I heard you can see boobies from all around the world in this museum if you know where to look. We're going on a booby bender. Boobity-boobity-a-la-la-la. This I could get used to. Deedlup. Rudolph Steiblitz? Wait, is that Regular-Sized Rudy or Pocket-Sized Rudy? Regular-Sized Rudy. Oh, thank God. Hey, what's the big idea? Geez, Rudy, quit sneaking up on people. Wear a bell. God, I have Henry Haber the school weirdo. Great, I have Tina Belcher. The dorkiest girl in the school. You know what? Maybe I'll show him how to be cooler. People used to think I was a weirdo, too. You know what? Maybe she just needs someone to show her how to be cool. People used to say I was a dork, too. This'll be fun. So, where's Bob today? On a field trip with the kids. At the museum. I guilted him into going. You miss him, huh? The thing is, he's still here. Don't you see? He's me. He's you, he's that spatula. - Aw. - Sure, it's a crappy restaurant and people walk right by it, never take notice. - Wait, what? - The floor's always sticky. Sticky? But it's home for a lot of folks. I'm getting choked up here. Okay the thing is, now that I made Bob go, I feel like those kids don't need me anymore. Now he gets to play mama bird. Singing the songs on the bus - Linda. - Holding hands - Linda, what are you doing here? - What? What? Go to them! Oh, oh! Go to the museum. Be with your babies, go to them! I got to go, I got to go! We'll be fine. I'm waiting on on fries. Lock the door, Linda! Get out! Why are we going? - Lock the door. - Go! Never look back, never look back! What you drawing there, Henry? I'm designing robot characters for my next graphic novel. It's part of a series. It's important to have interests, but maybe you can find one a little less dorky? Uh, it's actually pretty cool. Maybe you just don't understand it? Oh, I understand it. There's 17 installments, and you really need to read them in order, which you haven't, so I doubt it. This is going to be harder than I thought. Robots? But that does give me an idea for my next erotic Ro-butts. Hey, what's that noise? My cymbals you never know when somebody's gonna want to jam. Hmm, back me up with those, would you? Well, okay, but I haven't Hey, Mr. Frond. Why did the chicken cross the road? I don't know, Louise, why? So he would be in a different school district where there's a different guidance counselor. - Hiya! - Yeah! - Louise. - What? Don't say that here. That's fine I'm out of material. Ooh, is there a rat exhibit? I think those are picketers. Picketers? Even the people who get paid to go in there don't want to be in there! That's how terrible it is! It's a good thing your mom isn't here. Why, Mom likes protesting? What? No, she loves chanting. Oh, who doesn't? Yah, tah, yah-tah-tah! Hi, Madeline Greenberg, museum director. Phillip Frond, counselor of children, friend of the museum. I'm Bob, I, uh He's merely a volunteer. Oh. Well, you may have noticed, we're having a little trouble with the UFMWD? I've had problems with that. Drink some cranberry juice. Hmm, no, it's the United Federation of Museum Workers and Docents. They're on strike. Oh, like how my stepmom's on a sex strike till my dad fixes the VCR. Exactly, it hasn't affected much. We still have all the exhibits, all the fun, just one-eighth of the staff. An Amazon exhibit? Maybe this day won't suck so bad after all. Oh, that's not open. What?! No! The strike slowed us down there a little. Whoa. Nice plesiosaur. Nice horses. What'd you say? Plesiosaur. The coolest dinosaur. Hmm Henry, it's great that you have a favorite animal, but what about picking a cooler animal? Like a horse or miniature horse? Uh It's your first time as a parent volunteer, Bob. Linda's set the bar pretty high. I hope you're up to it. With great vest comes great responsibility. Ugh. Okay, kids, stick with your buddy and stay with the group! You don't want to be a Missing Marvin or a Walk-Away Wendy! Ugh huh? Okay, Regular-Sized Rudy, change of plans. I'm going in there, and you're coming with me. Yeah, I don't think we're allowed to do that - Oh, we're not. - Oh. We're going where no Wagstaff student The Amazon! Rudy, just keep your voice down. Oh Amazon? Yes, ma'am-azon! - Ha! - Shush! Shush! Sorry. Yes, ma'am-azon. I'm glad you're up for this, Rudy. I thought I was gonna - have to get a buddy-ectomy. - Are you kidding? This is great. I've never done anything like this. My mom barely let me go on this field trip. Ugh! Okay, I know you're new here, but this isn't how sneaking works. - You have to ditch the backpack. - Yeah, sure. No! I didn't mean throw it. That was loud. Okay, I'll show you the ropes, and then we're gonna go under the ropes - and touch all the stuff. - Yeah. I need to blow my nose. Uh, okay. - I can only blow it if you hold it. - Ugh. Now me. Oh, my God. Bob? Time for a head count. Uh oh. Four, eight, ten, I'm gonna push you now, Ollie. I'm gonna push you away now. I understand. Uh, uh, okay, who's missing? Oh, man. Louise. Figures. A- Are we good? Uh, uh-huh. Yeah. Definitely. I just got to go over here for a second. Be right back! Of course she's in there. Louise. Louise. Louise, come out of the plants. Who's Louise? I'm just a talking plant. My name is Leafy Greenbrier. And I am Kate Bush. Listen, both of you. I know you're not excited about this museum, but I can't have you kids being Missing Marvins or whatever that stupid thing Frond said. Walk-Away Wendys. - Thank you. - Uh-huh. Um, what's your name? Regular-Sized Rudy. Regular-Sized Rudy? Why do they call you that? - Just look at me. - Um, okay. Listen, you two are supposed to stay with the group. Ugh. Dad, when I hear ""stay with the group,"" I leave the group. Yeah, Louise, that can be annoying. All right, which way did we come in? Uh, come on, this way. No, you come on. Dad, look around. We're in the jungle. Ah! Can we just for a second walk around a little? Hmm. It is kind of impressive. Yeah. But we both know I have to take you guys back. You remind me of my mom. She hates fun, too. Hide. Get down. Hey! Who's over there? Shh-shh-shush. Somebody over there? Everybody shut up. Hello? Come on, Jeff, you know I hate plants. Oh, they're gonna drop their juice boxes when they see me. Museum management is unfair and anti-union. Yeah, I hear that, buddy. No, no, we're protesting. What do we want? Fairness. When do we want it? Now. - Oof. - What? The chant? Well, uh It's the chant, isn't it? Yeah. You got to wow 'em. Something like, uh Give us more money, damn it! Or we'll shave the woolly mammoth! Give us longer breaks for snacks or we'll burn the artifacts! You're really good at this. Thank you. - All right, good luck, got to go. - No, wait. We need you. Hmm? Remember, kids, smiling is the new touching. Nice. Also, if you ignore history, you're doomed to repeat it, and if you touch history, you will be suspended for six days. Yes and when you get to the pioneer exhibit, learn but don't churn. Who are you? Is there a, uh Mr. Museum? No, there is not. Okay, booby checklist. Let's see what we got. Did you get that at the gift shop? Nope, it's my cousin's. He wrote down where to find all the boobs in the museum. Viking boobies, yeah! Eskimo boobies, coming real soon. It's an embarrassment of boobies. Good one, Zeke. That's Jimmy Jr. You may not know him because he's one of the cooler kids in school. Hi, Jimmy Jr. Hi, Tina. I know Jimmy Jr. Hey, Jimmy J. Hey, Harvey. Hen-Henry. He's always joking like uh, not even my name, uh Okay, I think the coast is clear. Let's get back to the group. But we just hid from the guard. We're having fun here, ah? Come on, let's go into the stilt hut just so we can say we did it, and then we can go back to the boring group and that no-fun Frond and have a crappy day just like you want. Please. It's literally a hut on stilts. Fine. Stilt hut and then that's it. Stilt hut! - Stilt hut! - Shh. Stilt hut! Shh-shh-shush. Rudy rookie. I know. Now we're all whispering. So nothing for you to check off here, Zeke. They all have hair covering their boobs. Like a stupid fashion magazine, right? But not so fast. And three two ta-ta time. No nip, though. Wow. Your cousin's really into this. I never heard of anyone having a boob fetish. Well, this isn't even remotely realistic. - I mean, the stegosaurus - Henry. What did I say about dinosaurs? Why are you talking that way? I'm just trying to help you, Henry, okay, buddy? And I'm just trying to help you, buddy. All I'm saying is, the stegosaurus it's obviously - Uh-uh, honey. - Huh? No. - What a dork. - I know. Whoa, whoa. You think I'm the dork? Of course. Everyone does. No, no, no, no, you're the dork. Huh. Well, there's only one way to solve this. Well, there's probably, like, a lot of different ways. But why don't we try your dorky way? - Yeah, well, 'cause it's not the dorky way. - Can you just, it drop the dork and just talk to me? You look so dorky right now. Make our paycheck more colossal! Or we'll poop on all the fossils! - Yes. - Rude. Well, great stilt hut. - Yeah. - The best. Now, let's go back. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. The stilt hut was my fun jungle idea. Now what's, what-what's one from you? What do you got? Um, go back. Don't say ""go back."" Warren Fitzgerald wouldn't say go back. Warren Fitzgerald would say you've gone soft. Warren Fitzgerald? From my zebra story? Yeah. From your fun past. I've got ideas, but I don't believe you have ideas unless you say them out loud. Yes, of course I have ideas. If I look around, I could come up with something. Okay, well, then look around and come up with something. Okay, there. We're gonna go right there. Look who's stepping up. But, uh, how are we gonna get up there? We could fly. I know we can't fly. We could just do this. Huh? Who's soft now, Louise? Your stomach, your butt, and your thighs. But nice work. Let's go! Mr. Softie just pushed over a tree. I like it. Hey, shake a leg, Reg Size. I'll be right there. And Mom said I'd never climb a tree. All right, race you to the top. Let's do it! First one up gets to spit down on the other. Don't worry, Rudy, we're not gonna spit on you. As long as I'm included. Ooh, ooh. Look! Camel boobies. Those are humps. One man's hump Okay, students, buddy up. In a few moments we'll proceed to the hands-on room of the museum. Oh, finally! Yay! Sands from Exotic Lands! Sand? Really? That's what floats your scrote? And then some. Mmm, the hands-on room. It's the one place you're allowed to touch. Your skin should be its own exhibit. Well, your hair should be sent to an Asian wig factory. Oh. - Who's a bigger dork, Henry Haber or me? - You. - Henry. - Not helpful. Bigger dork, me or Henry? - Tina. - Henry. Well, looks like we're dork-locked. We need fresh eyes. Hello, I'm Tina and this is Henry. - I'm Henry. - Yeah. Who do you think is the bigger dork? Um, I don't think you kids should play this game. Labels lead to hurt feelings. Sheesh. Never ask a dork to judge a dork contest. Yeah. Come on. Pick up the pace, softie. Softie? That's funny coming from the girl who called me Daddy until she was eight. What? That's crazy. You better have a good lawyer, 'cause that is slander, sir. That's me laughing. Time to kick it up a notch, okay? Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom! Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom! Weeda, weeda, weina, weina, weina, wang. Weeda, weeda, weina, weina, weina, wang. Shake your hips! Wiggle your butt! Drop your pants and pick 'em back up! - No. I don't want to drop my pants. - Why? Ha! We did it! You know what? I am gonna spit. Hey, I'm glad we ditched. That was fun. Me, too. Let's do it again sometime. Like, maybe when you're old and senile, I'll close the restaurant and come spring you from the nursing home. What? Sorry, I didn't want to do it, but Gene and Tina put you in a nursing home. And not one of the nice ones either. No, you said you'd be running the restaurant. Oh, no, I was just saying You're taking over the family business? - Yeah, right. - Ha! - Admit it, you look up to me. - No! S You are ruining our perfect day right now! Oh, my God, am I your hero? Sick! Fun hurts my lungs. Wow. I thought I was out of shape. - What the - Oh! Shh, shh, shh. This doesn't go here. Disgusting tree. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew! Whoa. That's gonna make getting down a lot harder. Oh, crap, crap, crap. We're stuck up here. This was a stupid idea. Um, Rudy, are you okay? Haven't gone this long without my inhaler. - Inhaler? - I'm supposed to use it every two hours or I could die. - What? But I'm sick of that thing. O- Okay. Where's your inhaler? In my backpack. - Where's your backpack? - Um, I made him ditch it. What? But don't worry about me. I'm loving every minute of this. Oh, my God. Wait! Security guy! Come back! Help! Help! Why didn't you tell me you need your inhaler? I'm your buddy. We're supposed to talk. - We talk. - This is why you can't just do whatever you want, Louise, there are consequences. You shouldn't have left the group. And I shouldn't have let you talk me into doing this! So it's your fault? No! Right now we just have to get Rudy his inhaler! How are we gonna get down? That tree was our ladder. I know that tree was our ladder! I put it there! I think I'm coming around. I think I'm getting better. Nope! Getting worse. Getting worse. Oh. Oh, boy. Uh, CPR. I know how to give CPR. No, thank you. Uh, wh-why don't I just try it? And if you hate it, I'll stop. - No! - Yeah, okay, you're right. Just hold on. - I have an idea. - What? - Wish me luck. - Wh-What are you doing? Maybe the bravest and dumbest thing I've ever done. This is for you, Warren Fitzgerald! And you, too, Rudy. - Cool. - Whoa! Dad! Whoa! That was amazing! Hello, sand. You remember these hands? We're finally done with boobs! Oh, Gene, you're never done with boobs. They're everywhere you look! Mountains, speed bumps Hell, you just made a nice pair yourself, Cool Breeze. You've ruined sand! Darn it. We still haven't settled this. I don't get it. Why would anyone think I'm a dork? - Well, what makes me a dork? - Well, um, you're a dork for plesiosaurs. And your comic book. Graphic novel. But, yes, I also dabble in comic books, - action figures, and stickers. - Yeah. See? Well, you're a dork for horses. Huh, I am. Among other things. Hmm. I guess we're both dorks in our own way. Everyone! I have an announcement. You're probably all wondering how the voting came out in the Tina/Henry dork controversy. No. Well, the verdict is in. I'm a dork. For boys and horses and zombies. And I'm a dork for dinosaurs and my series of graphic novels. I guess I'm a dork for dancing. Okay, then I'm a dork for sand. Guess that makes me a dork for boobs. I'm a dork for Ollie. I'm a dork for Andy! And I'm a dork for bargain Chardonnays And being asked out by handsome guidance counselors. What about you, Mr. Frond? I'm a dork for getting on the bus on time. Get your buddies and let's go! - Call me. - Oh! - If my mother answers, hang up. - Oh. We might be dorks for different things, but at our cores, we're all the same. I made a very good point. Let's all go now. Boys are from Mars, girls are from Venus. I've got a yum-yum, you've got a penis. Uh, Linda? What? Ow. What? Uh, we've been talking, and we want you to leave. Wha Really! You want me to leave? Yeah. Well, chant for it. Oh, wait. I'm sorry. That's right. You can't chant! Ha! How many pumps? L-Let me read the instructions. Oh, what, you're worried he's gonna breathe too well? - Come on! - Fine! Thank you. Buddy. Oh, I hate you. But I love air. So I guess we're stuck together. - Let me get a puff of that. - Hey! You're not allowed to be in here. What's going on?! Uh, we're, uh Run! - What do we want? - Linda gone! - When do we want it? - Now! Linda Belcher's here to stay! I don't work here anyway! Boo! Oh, my face! Scabs! Scabs are coming! Let's get 'em! They'll do anything for a dollar! Did you come to surprise us, but then you got caught up - in the chanting? - Yep. Did Louise get you in trouble with security? - Yep. See you at home? - Yep. Uh-oh. I'm missing two. Here they are. Two here. Oh. Regular-Sized Rudy, I detect a bit of wheeze. He needs an inhaler every two hours or he'll die. Yeah. I-I heard about that. Oh, uh, here's your vest. What did you do to it?! It was like this when I got it. Gene! Tina! How was your day? - Dorky. - Booby. Great, great, glad you had fun. - I think we're in the clear. - Yeah, we got away with it. That's not what you should be taking away from this. Did we get away with it, Rude? Perfect crime. Mmm. I've tasted life, and I'm hungry for more. You do realize you almost made Rudy die. Almost dying is the best part of living. It's called almost-live-dying. So, when you run the restaurant, will you call it Louise's Burgers? I don't know. Maybe. Daddy.

"Well, they go great with this top. It's also called a jersey, Gene. No. Ease up, everybody, back off. It's his first game. Oh! This is so exciting! I'll show you exciting. Hi-ya! I've got armor for my ding-dong! Come on. That's not how you hit a crotch with a baseball bat. This is how you hit a crotch with a baseball bat. Ha-ha-ha! What doesn't break my testicles only makes them stronger! Wow, Gene is really athletic. I love baseball: The pizza parties, the spiky shoes, the parade at the end of the season where we ride on a float. How's my wave? - Hi - Hi Hey, Teddy, do you want an espresso before we close up? A what? An espresso. Huh? Whoa, look at that. Yeah, it was a little pricey, but it's an investment, right? Someone comes in for a burger, they'll say, ""Oh, Bob, finally you're selling espresso."" Oh, Bobby, it's like that hot plate you bought. You had big dreams for that. Where is it now? It's right there. Oh. Ow, it's hot. Teddy, why don't you try one? It's on the house. Nah. Well, just to see if you like it. I don't wanna, Bob. I'm declining politely. Just take one shot, Teddy! I don't like those tiny cups! Just drink one! They make it look like I have giant hands! Come on! Leave me alone! Oh, fine. Really? You're gonna give up that easy? Well, if no one's gonna drink this, maybe I'll just Ugh, that's terrible. That's that's Ooh Ah Ooh Ooh, ah Oh ooh Hey, Tina. - Hi, Teddy. - Hi. Uh Huh. Gross, right? Yeah, it's an acquired taste that I just acquired. Hey, batter, batter, batter, hey, batter, batter, batter, hey, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter, hey, hey, hey, hey! Strike three! You're out. Ha-ha! I made that kid strike out. I did that! I'm part of this! Which one's yours? Oh, he's down there in the dugout entertaining the troops. Normal Gene. Evil Gene. Normal Gene. Evil Gene. I think I can hear my hair growing, especially the bangs. Hey, maybe that's why they call them bangs. Hey, keep it down. How many espressos have you had? Just one. I'm being really interesting right now, I can tell. Usually my personality is a little flat. Did you ever pick up on that? That you have a personality? No. How we doing, Coach? Have you played all your kids? Uh, yeah, I think I got 'em all. Pretty much. Yeah, I got 'em all. Yeah, I think, I think so, yeah. What about Belly Bongo? Come on. I played my girl. I'm a boy. You got to play Belly Bongo, Coach. All right, Gene, you're in. What about urine? Grab a bat. Done. Now what? Sometimes with Jimmy Jr., I don't know what to say. But now I don't know what not to say. I have all these thoughts, and it's like, ""Okay, guys, who can get to my mouth first?"" I think I love Espresso Tina. Thanks. I think Jimmy Jr. will, too. Oh, Gene's going up to bat! Yay! Go, Gene, go! Whoo! Why does he have to play now? The game's tied. Gene doesn't even thrive under no pressure. Okay, just roll it at me as slowly as you feel like. Oh, God. Aah! Strike one, strike two, strike three! I surrender! He's a, a little tentative out there. He kind of got a piece of it, right? Not really. No, no, he didn't. Ow! It's not your fault you lost, sweetie. It's his fault. Hey! Button it, you seventh inning bi Oh, Gene, oh, you played! Wasn't it fun? I hate baseball! I hate it! Gene, wait! Oh, nice slide, honey! It's not that bad, Gene. You made some errors, you struck out, one or two people booed. Louise. To be fair, I also laughed. That's it! I'll never set foot on a baseball field again except as a streaker! I quit! If you quit, you'd be a quitter. That's worse than being a loser. Well, let's not dismiss the quitting idea. - Bob! - What? It has a quiet dignity to it. Quiet dignity? Have you met us?! Uh, Bob, what's the Burger of the Day? I'm looking at an empty chalkboard here. Well, it's something with gouda cheese. I'm still trying to come up with a name for it. Woulda Coulda Gouda. You Gouda Be Kidding Me. As Gouda As It Gets. Gouda Gouda Gumdrops. A Few Gouda Men. Gouda Gouda Two Shoes comes with shoes. Gouda Day, Sir. Uh, Tina, no more espresso for you. There goes Jimmy Jr. Hey, Jimmy Jr., I see you're riding a bicycle. Do you know they call it a bicycle because ""bi"" means two? Speaking of two, there's two of us. Do you want to go on a date, by the way? Uh, okay. What's good for you? How about tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? I know I'll be up. Uh Great. So it's a date. I'll see you then. We'll get coffee. Oops, wrong way. Eh We're gonna turn this sinking ship around. You just need a little extra coaching. Right, Bob? Bob? Huh? Coaching. A little extra coaching. - In? - Baseball! - From? - You! Oh! Right. For Gene. Sure. Yes, you. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Ah I probably should have been playing catch with you for years. Then you'd be good at it. It's so beautiful here. Dad, is this Heaven? It's not Heaven, but the, but the lighting is nice, right? It's a nice time of day. You know, when I saw you playing the game, it looked to me like you were a little afraid of the ball. The stitches remind me of Frankenstein! All right, I'm gonna toss it to you easy, Gene, okay? It's getting hard to see, so let me know when you throw it. Uh-oh. Oh! You hit me in the nose! I'm sorry! I said I was gonna throw it. Here, you can have a free throw at me. Ow! I thought you couldn't throw! I was aiming at your feet! Ow! Stop it, Gene! That time I aimed at your face! All right, how about this? Aah! Don't throw that! Do not throw that! Hey, look at this. I Yahoogled ""boy needs baseball help, father-son fail unathletic hopeless turquoise jewelry."" Why turquoise jewelry? 'Cause I've been looking for some. It's coming back. Anyway, look what came up. ""The Deuce of Diamonds' Diamonds in the Rough in the Diamond Baseball Camp."" It's rated four diamonds! Hello there, ballers. I'm the Deuce of Diamonds! Hey, I know him. He used to be the Prince of Persuasia. The Prince of whosia? A teacher of the ancient art of seduction. Dr. Yap had his video. I learned so much. But now I have something better, a magic black bean. - A what? - Nothing. What's holding you back from maximum baseball excellence? Guess what was standing in my way. I was. Wow, that's deep. - Deeply dumb. - Shh! I was striking myself out. Then I unlocked the baseball awesomeness inside my body. Now look at me. He didn't do that. Check out these incredible results from my one-day Diamonds in the Rough in the Diamond Baseball Camp. Now he's Deucing it. Now they're all Deucing it. Ooh, look at this. The Deuce is holding his camp in town tomorrow! And it's only $495. $495 for that? That's crazy. For that kind of money, he should throw in $495. Don't be a cheapskate, Bob. Do you love Gene or not? Of course I love Gene. Ew! Then we're spending $495. We don't have it! Oh, go fart in a fortune cookie. No fair! I can't have $495, but Tina can have all the glasses she wants?! Ugh! Let's discuss this over a frothy espresso. I'll go make it. No more espresso, Tina. I'm gonna lock her in her room. No. Ah, maybe I could sell something valuable. I got a Spanish edition of Fifty Shades of Grey I found on a bus. Cincuenta Sombras de Grey. Don't tell your father. You could sell your soul. I did, and look at me, I'm fine. I have something more precious than my soul. And this one and this one. Good-bye. Ooh, and this one. Okay. Bye-bye. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, okay. And this one. Oh, no-no-no, not that one. Not that. I don't know how that got in there. Okay. Wait, wait. A couple more. Bye. Go. Okay. Look, I need $495. Plus that derringer. Look, the kitsch craze is kind of played out. No one likes babies. What? Who doesn't? What? I got a shelf of 'em. Oh! Look at that one! Let me see that one! Uh, Mom. What? Oh. Going in the wrong direction. I'm sorry. Maybe if you had some fine art or antique coins or firearms. - Or high-end restaurant equipment? - Talk to me. What about the? Ah Stealing and pawning. I feel so dirty! I told you you'd like crime, Mom. Eh yeah, I do. Wounder why dad changes his mind about me going to the Deuce of Diamonds' Baseball Camp? Well, because he loves you. But you don't let him know that you know, all right? He doesn't like to talk about his feelings. He's all stunted inside like a big dumb man, all right? It's our little secret, okay? Just like our Sunday mani-pedis. Oh, look, there he is! Hi, The Deuce. This is Gene. I've got the heart of a baseball player but the body of a manager. Office manager. No problem, that's what we're here for. Baseball is all I do. The Closer of Close-Up Magic. Don't worry about that. The Iceman of Inkjet Printer Repair? Those are just in my trunk. Now, about the tuition Ah! It wasn't easy, but I got it all. Great, cash! I mean, checks are so formal. It's a lot of money. But you guarantee results, right, Deuce? You better write your name on this little guy because you're not gonna recognize him when you pick him up. Ha-ha! I'm gonna have a killer fastball and a magnificent perm. Whoo! I'm gonna have a hot dog. Hey-hey-hey, Jimmy Pesto! Hi, Linda. Thanks for the heads up about the baseball camp. Isn't it great? Last chance to earn my love, guys. I love that joke. Okay, guys, let's get started. I'm gonna count these checks, and you guys are gonna inject yourself with some performance-enhancing enthusiasm! Yay! I am going to be athletic. How you doing, Tina? You seem a little logy. Well, you seem a little shut your face. - Whoa. - Tina! It's her first day since I cut her off espresso, so Yeah, when you dance with the bear, you can't stop until the bear wants to stop. Espresso's the bear. Come on, Dad. Just let me bite down on a bean! No! No espresso! You can't have any and your father can't sell any. And, uh, I mean, he's allowed to, he just never, ever will. So end of subject. Uh, ooh, look at the sky. You know what? I've been thinking about it. Maybe I should try it. Broaden my horizons. No, don't! I- I saw a report. It'll shrink your penis. Yeah, it'll shrink it. One study says it'll shrink, the other says it'll grow. You got to just live your life. Set me up, Bob. My first sale. We never thought he'd actually sell one. I just got to take off the dust cover. Take off that dust cover. Where is it?! Oh, my God, it's gone. Oh, how odd. Okay, guys, listen up. Your glove is your best friend. But you are not its best friend. You're its boss and you are pissed off. Now punish your glove. Pound it. Make it afraid to miss a ball ever. You've got to start meeting your performance goals! When you change your attitude, you change your batitude. So swing away. Uh, Mr. The Deuce, you don't have a baseball. If we played with a real ball, we'd spend half the day running after it. It's all in your mind. - Whoa. - Wow. That's a double in the gap. - Home run. - Ooh! Broken bat, single. I'll need a pinch runner. I said I'm gonna need a pinch runner. Speak up, please. Long fly ball. This could go. Oh, no, caught at the wall. No! By you. You hit it, you caught it. Amazing over-the-shoulder catch. I was robbed. By me. An espresso machine doesn't just walk away. Where are you, you big, beautiful silver bastard? Who would do this? Hi, Tina. What, what, what?! I just I was saying hi. 'Cause I just walked in, so what do you mean, what? Oh, my God, I never noticed how annoying you are. I can't even understand what you're saying. Oh, I have a speech impediment, Tina. Well, fix it. Hey, where's Gene? Ah, Gene, Gene, Gene. That's all you ever talk about. What about me? Look at me. Gene's at that baseball thing. My brothers are there, too. What?! Oh, that's right. Uh, Gene's at, uh Deuce of Diamonds' Baseball Camp. Playing baseball. Okay, cross home. Tip your cap. Chest bump the guy on deck, and that's a home run ot. Okay, any questions so far? About anything at all. Girls, boys, life, money, inkjet printer repair. Um, can I be a good baseball player with asthma? Rudy, I'm gonna tell you a story. A famous baseball player whose name I can't remember right now had Lou Gehrig's Disease and he didn't let it slow him down. That was inspiring. Um, can Ollie and I be umpires? Yes, you can. You're out of there! You're out of there! You're out of there! You're out of there! The Deuce, will I ever get over being scared of the ball? Gene, listen to me. You are so much bigger and rounder than that ball, it should be scared of you. Oh, no, it's Gene. I won't hurt you, baseball. That's okay. It's your job to hit me over the fence. I love you so much, Gene. Aw. Hold on, getting a call. Ugh, Mr. You Owe Me $1,100 Manoogian. That is a long first name and a long last name. Hey, Mr. Manoogian. Well, I've been trying to reach you, too. Uh-huh, I see. Yes, sir. Okay. Well, I could pay the bill now, so you can go ahead and not put my stuff out on the street. I'm sorry, it's how much? Minibar? That's where they get you. All right, well, you know what? Then I'm coming down there. And I'm bringing some of my people. Okay, guys, listen up. Um, sometimes in baseball you go on a road trip. So let's practice piling into the team bus over there. Now, everybody grab a bat. Linda, look at me. How did you pay for baseball camp? Uh I, uh, I sold my porcelain babies. Wait, I saw those when I was tearing the place apart. So you didn't sell them! Those are my backup babies. Yeah, that's the B-team. Look how ugly they are. You can do this the easy way or the hard way. Tina! Do you think I'm playing here? I need that espresso machine back oh, my head. Hi, Tina, I think you're more into espresso than you are into me. It's true. I love espresso, coffee, caffeinated teas, and then Jimmy Jr. In that order. All right, I did it. I sold the espresso machine. That machine was the crown jewel of this restaurant, Linda. It was made in Turin, Italy. That's where they make Fiats! Big whoop. It was a waste of money. I'd rather waste money on Gene. You don't even know if this Deuce is legit. He has a Web site. Yeah, they don't just give those out. We're going down there and we're coming back with our money. Or a really good baseball player. I hope neither of you are getting your hopes up. Tina, break another one. That one. Oh, no. Okay, we're here. Everybody out. Hey, this is where our dad goes for his naps. Hi, Mr. Manoogian! - Oh, crap. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, too late! Listen. Come on! You're too late! Come on, man. Not cool! You're not cool! Now, listen. I don't have the whole $1,100 in cash. Oh But I can sign over some checks. Now, this one has a flag on it, and patriotic checks never bounce. No, no, no, I don't need your stupid flag checks, okay?! Pay me now, or I'm keeping your DVD player. It's not a DVD player, it's a Blu-ray player that also plays DVDs! Well, then, that makes it a DVD player! No, it doesn't! Hey, how much for this hot pot? This is not a yard sale. Three dollars. Okay, it is a yard sale. Well, they were here. Oh, that's great, so this guy The Deuce just takes off somewhere with all the kids? Look, he left that gym bag. See, we've got bath towels from the Sand Flea motel and some crumbled deodorant in a baggy. See, that's valuable. He's got to come back for that. Oh, my God, Lin, I don't want to sit around waiting for him. Let's go to the Sand Flea. Yeah, we shouldn't even stop for coffee. But let's stop for coffee. Okay, this isn't enough. You're still way short. Sorry I couldn't move the tube socks. Okay, fine! If that's how you want to play it, we're just gonna take some swings at your soda machine. Go to it, guys. But isn't that vandalism? Babe Ruth used to beat the crap out of a root beer machine. Now look at him. Okay. Yeah, there you go. Four-bagger. Grand salami. That's a good looking foul ball right there. Soda, you made me fat, but you also made me strong! Maid cart, get it. I'll come back later. These boys are very weak. I see no damage. They're damaging your pride. Not very much. Oh, my God, there's Gene. Gene, what are you doing? Playing baseball, and I'm great. Look at his swing, Bobby. Poetry in motion. Yeah, slow motion. Some soda's leaking out. It might have caffeine in it. Tina, don't lick that. Do you folks mind? These practices are closed to parents. Just give us our money back and we'll go. Refund, no. That's not gonna happen. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Guys, I did everything The Deuce told me to and now I'm excellent at baseball. Gene, this is a scam. Excuse me, The Deuce has ears and feelings. Well, I'm sorry. Well, I forgive you. But now we want our money. Whoa, bro, easy. The next game Gene plays, you'll notice a real diff. Too bad, by then, I'll be setting up my winter camp in Arizona. Deucing in the desert. Aw, you're gonna miss Gene hitting all those home runs. And you're gonna miss the leaves changing. He's not better, Lin. It's not a real baseball camp. He is so better. I wish there was a game right now. He'd show you, buddy. You know, what? A game right now. Let's do that. Yeah, let's do that. Well, let's not rush into anything. Some of my training takes a little time to sink in. Oh, don't be modest, The Deuce. You know what you're doing. He's gifted; He said so. He's gonna do a TED Talk. Okay, look, I got to go. No, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere. We've got enough people here for a game in that vacant lot right there. Now, if Gene gets a hit which he won't, because you're a fraud you keep the money. If not, we get a full refund. - That sounds really complicated. - I didn't get it either. Play ball! Play ball.  For the land of the free  And the home of the brave. Okay, first base is The Deuce's baggy of deodorant, second and third are his Rollerblades, and home is his hemorrhoid pillow. Play ball! You can do it, Gene. Get a hit and disappoint your father. Okay. No hit, no hit, no hit, no hit! Come on, Gene. Wait for a big fat one right over the ass pad. Here it comes, Gene. Nothing to be afraid of. Oh, my God, you hit it I mean, of course you hit it, I'm a great coach. Gene hit it. That's a hit. It's n a hit if somebody catches it. Call it, someone. I got it! I got it! Wait, do you want it? No, not if you want it. You can have it. But it sounded like you wanted it. Make up your minds! Let's share it! No, no, don't share it! No! Now it's a hit. Hey, he's still running. Throw to first. Throw to first base! Ah, you're such a dick, Bob. Ow. That had some mustard on it. For real. - No! - It's a hit! It's an error, not a hit. Gene got a hit, you jerk. You're blind. Put some lenses in those things! I'm blind to marry you! Why don't you steal home, you thief? You've stolen everything else. You love a coffee machine more than you love your son. Get your finger out of my face. You're out of here, pal! Get your finger out of my face! Stuff it up your crackerjacks! Your fat finger! - Hey, there goes The Deuce. - Oh, crap. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm really gonna miss that guy. He gave us his magic and then he disappeared. Just like Toad the Wet Sprocket. Are we going to the pizza party now? - No. - Oh. Hey, Mr. Belcher, just wait till next year. Don't. Don't do that. What are you doing? Don't do that. See, Bob, it was all worth it. Gene learned confidence. From a confidence man. I got conned good. And that ain't bad. I guess I'm happy that Gene's happy. But that espresso machine just really made me proud, - that's all. - That dirty hunk of junk? I'm glad it's gone. It wasn't good for Tina. Where is Tina? That pot is a week old. I put my cigarettes out in that. Do you want cream or sugar?  You can't see it  It's electric!   You gotta feel it  It's electric!   Ooh, it's shakin'  It's electric!   She's a-movin' like electric  She sure got the boogie  You gotta know it  It's electric!"
"Ah! Air! Come on, kids. Get some of that woodsy air in your lungs. Oh, that's pretty woodsy, right? - Woodsiest I've ever smelled. - Yeah. My musk will blend right in. I'm pretty sure camping isn't good for my I don't know, knees? I've got a note around here somewhere. I'll write you a note after I write myself one. Come on, guys. It's not Tina's fault she was sick when her Thundergirl troop went camping. This way, you all get to go on my make-up camping trip. Yay. What do we know about camping? We come from a family of city dwellers. We're all gonna die! Hey, I know plenty about camping. I used to go camping, once, when I was a kid. It's great, from what I remember. Plus, what would you say if I told you I'm carrying a saw in my pocket right now? Is that what you said when you met Mom? Are those nail clippers? It's my Nature Master. It's a multi-tool. It does everything nature requires. Could it kill an eagle? Why would we want to kill an eagle? I don't know. They're so condescending. Yes! We're killing eagles. Actually, my Thundergirl handbook says to leave only footprints, so we probably shouldn't kill anything. We could go on a 13-smilehike. There's taking pictures with your mind. Consensual bird watching. We don't have to do any of that, do we, Bob? No. Hiya, folks. You picked a great weekend to camp. You'll all be fine. Um great. Wait, why'd you say we'll all be fine? Because you will. You'll all be fine. Just mind the river, that's all. It's, uh, high this year. But you'll be fine. And your family will be fine. Okay. ThunderMint? God, no. Keep those in a sealed container. We've had some aggressive wildlife out here lately. Bears? No. Squirrels. Seriously? We've lost some good people recently. To the squirrels? Bears. What? Kidding. Budget cuts. They've made a lot of budget cuts and now it's just me. People don't value the parks and then they get what they get. - Bob, this guy's freakin' me out. - Shh. It's fun. It's ranger humor. Uh, so, we're gonna drive now, so, thanks for everything. Camp at your own risk. State park motto. Sir, I need you to lift the gate. Yeah, right, the gate. Sure. Yeah, you just sort of left. Open. Open sesame. There you go. Thank you. Nature boner! Mm, boing! That's not what it is, Gene. Come on. It's a rock. It's a wang. Mount Wang. William Archibald Wang, a Chinese diplomat, was the first to summit that mountain. William Wang, what can't you do? Where's he now? Back in the city, staying at a hotel like a normal person. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! What are those? Bees? Oh, I hate 'em. Great identification, Mom. Thank you, Tina. Wait, Bob, this is all you packed? Well, I mean, I packed this, my Nature Master, and I got two tents and this cool camping stove I borrowed from Teddy. What about food? And water? And what about toiletries? Well, there's a river right there. That's all the water you could ever drink, you know? - So we'll be fine for one day. - Oh. And the river's also nature's grocery store. That's where we get all our food, like fish and vegetables. Vegetables?! Yes. From upriver. - Mac and cheese? - And we'll make our own cheese. We can do that in the woods. But how? I-I-I Because you ferment the milk from I Look, people, everything we need is right here. Or over there. There's no line for that food truck. You know what? Fine. I'm going to go catch me a meal. In that river. With this. We're gonna catch all the fish. God, I love you. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. We're camping over there, and my husband blew it on packing. Can I borrow some crackers or, you know, peanut butter? You guys, you look so prepared. You've got to be prepared when civilization breaks down. - Oh. - Wait, why will civilization break down? - Have you been to the post office lately? - She knows. That's right I know. What does she know? You know. I know you know I know. What happens at the post office? They seem organized. He doesn't know. He doesn't know anything. What? Perhaps you might be interested in reading more about it in our literature. Oh! Okay. Huh. Please borrow whatever you need. Ooh. That plus that plus that. Oh, uh Wow. I-I need my juice. Okay. Well, enjoy our provisions while you digest our truths. Thank you so much. Um, can I borrow some wine, too? Wine helps me drink. Come on, kids, let's go. Mmm, mmm! Those kooks make some good chili. Bobby, you sure you don't want any chili? No. I will be enjoying the fish I caught. That's a fish? Yeah, Gene. It's a trout. It's king of the river. I can cut it up if anyone wants to share. You know, I'm not gonna be able to eat all this. Dad, are you sure you cooked it enough? Tina, the worst thing you can do is overcook a trout. I wish I could cook it less. Enjoy your goldfish, wild man. That's a lot of bones. But with trout, when you're as experienced as I am you learn to use your mouth to take the bones out. Use the back of your  throat. Wow. They're asleep. Must be the woodsy air. Yeah. Crazy how kids can fall asleep sober like that. Mm. Hey, I read that there's a warm spring around here. Some people skinny-dip there. You want to, uh, go find it? A warm spring? Don't you mean a hot spring? Well, it said warm spring. What about the kids? They're fine. We'll be close. Okay, but if a deer sees me naked, you can't get jealous. What about the vest? Oh, no, this guy stays on. Oh, that's nice. Ah. Come on in. Whoo! Uh 'Scuse me. Oh, that's really trouty. This is lukewarm at best. They should call it a tepid spring. Really? 'Cause I'm, uh Wow. I'm boiling in here. Oh, boy. I'm gonna, uh I'm just gonna use the restroom. I mean, a tree. I mean, - I got to get out of here. - Hey, where you going? Come back to Mommy. - No, not right now. Don't Let go, Lin. - Let's make this crappy little warm spring hot. - Let go. Let go. I got to go to the bathroom. - Come to Mommy. Come on. Give me your hand. - Let go. Please, Lin. Definitely an emergency. - Come to Mommy. Let go! Oh! Oh! Whoa, whoa. Oh! Oh! What was that? The loud sound? Yeah. Probably an owl? Should one of us go check it out? Not me? Guys, come on, listen, it's nature. We're not all gonna make it tonight. Safe, safe, goner. Good night. - Linda?! - Bob! Grab that branch! Aah! Aah! This river is really fast! Fastest I've ever seen! You see lots of fast rivers, Bob? No! I'm just saying that this is really fast, okay? - Oh, what do you know? - You're gonna argue with me now?! Yes, now! When we're flying 30 miles an hour down a river?! We made it. What the hell was that river's problem? You stupid river! I'm gonna sit down. Nope! I'm gonna go over there for a sec. - Bob? - Oh, boy. Lin, look over there. It's a pelican. And Patrick Duffy. Patrick Duffy?! Where? I love Dallas. Oh, he ran away. Where'd you go? I, uh, got a-a walking stick. That's why I went behind that bush. I didn't have diarrhea at all. I love it out here. Oh, God. There's got to be a better stick back there. I'll go find it. Oh! Where are you, Bob? Bob? There's the better stick right there. - I found it. Hey, Lin. - Oh. How do you l-like my new walking stick? That old one was so stupid compared to this one. This is the one I wanted. Why does this vest smell like puke and fish? That's the smell of a man. A healthy camping man. Camping's gross. And we're friggin' lost. You might be lost, but I'm not lost. I know the woods. All we have to do is just follow the river back to camp. You sure about that, Mr. Outdoors? Yeah. We'll be in our tent before the kids even wake up. Good. We got to get to the kids before wolves raise 'em. It's my worst fear. Little Wolf Gene. I'd have to cut holes in all the seats of his pants. - Why? - For the tail. Why would we even dress him? - He's a wolf. - Because he'd still need to go to school - and be loved by the other kids. - But he'd be a he wouldn't want - to wear clothes. It doesn't - Just because he's different, Bob. Do you know how much money we would save, Lin? I'm gonna put a breakfast order in at the RV. You guysant anything? Where are Mom and Dad? They're not in there? Maybe they went for a morning hike. No. Look. It's their clothes. Oh, no! Mom and Dad melted! Things got a little physical. Signs of a struggle. Clothes went off. When these rocks gave way and then whoosh. Oh, my God. Mom and Dad could be nude dangling over the edge of a cliff. According to the Thundergirl handbook, we should wait here for a person of authority to arrive. Can I see that page? Sure. Thank you. We should tube down the river and find Mom and Dad. We should really tube. Let's tube! Yes, let's tube! Why are we talking when we should be tubing? Isn't this stealing? Nuh-uh, it's borrowing. 'Cause Thundergirls don't steal. Well, uh, we're borrowing. Borrow everything that isn't nailed down! You're staying with me until I put you on Dad myself! Wait, let's tie our tubes together so we don't get separated. Yeah, let's get our tubes tied! Okay, let's whoosh. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Yeah! Hey, look, it's Mount Wang! Why does it look so small? Oh, crap. We followed the wrong river! How did we do that? This feeds into that, and we followed this all night. - Oh - Oh, my God. I feel sick. Okay, okay. This is just like when we forgot where we parked at the baseball game. We'll do what we did then. We walked back to the entrance of the stadium and then we retraced our steps. We got to go down to this river again and we come up the right river to the campsite. That's a dumb plan. It will take too long. Well, what do we do?! The kids must be worried sick about us. We need to go straight across. Are you sure, Bobby? Yes, I'm sure. The right way is that way? That might not have sounded like I'm sure but I'm sure. All right; You're the Nature Master. We're coming for you, kids! We're coming for you Mom and Dad! Oh, I'm so hungry, Bobby. Oh, my God, I ate an ant. Oh, I just ate another one. - Mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm. - Lin, what are you doing? - Oh, they're not bad. Oh, look, a worm! - Oh, don't eat Don't eat that  No Oh! Huh! Right there. Come here, you little sucker. - Come on! - Don't eat a worm in front of me. - Please, I don't want to see you eat a worm. - Oh. Mmm. Come on. - Try one, Bob. -  Get that way from me. - Just a taste. Just a taste. - Get it away. Oh, why did we go camping?! Huh. There's nothing in here about finding lost parents. Did you know there are eight different ways to hold hands? Tina! Stop reading that stupid Thundergirl book! I have something from the RV I can read from. ""Apocatips for the Apocalypse."" - ""Don't wait for nightfall to build shelter."" - That makes sense. ""Leave no trace. Shave off your fingerprints."" Been saying that for years. My feet don't work anymore. Carry me. Oh, come on. We got to get to the kids before it gets dark. Right, the kids. Second wind! Didn't work. Okay, I guess we're stopping. I'm just gonna lay down for a sec, recharge my battery, all right? Oh, my God. We're gonna spend another night in the woods? Okay. We need a fire. We got to make a fire. Just, um put some wood on your face. Bob, you're not making sense. Don't say fish! Oh, Bobby! Help! Can anyone hear me?! Patrick Duffy! ""Now that your shelter is built, you must seal the perimeter. Remember the 30 sticks you've sharpened to a deadly point?"" Yeah. ""They will now be utilized."" Oh, I thought they were for some kind of skit. Thundergirls do skits around the campfire. What skit would that possibly be for? I don't know. You should see some of the skits that get produced. Look at this part. They say insects can and should be weaponized. ""Beware of any organization that rewards members ""with empty titles or trinkets. These are the wool of the sheep."" Hey, Tina, you're looking a little sheepish yourself right now. My Thundergirl patches aren't trinkets. Though I did get this patch for making trinkets. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for your stupid make-up trip. And we've learned more useful stuff in two hours from this baby than you've ever learned from those brainwashing Thundergirls. I'm not brainwashed. - Do you chant or repeat mantras? - No. I'm a Thundergirl. I'm a Thundergirl. I'm a Thundergirl. Oh. Yes. Shut up. Shut up! Look over there. We're not alone, guys. It could be aggressive squirrels worshipping fire. It could be Mom and Dad. Either way, grab a spear. We're going in. Rain, rain! Flash, flash! Thundergirls wear a thunder  sash! Oh, my God. That sounds like Thundergirl troop number 39. They won the regional chant-off. Hello, who's over there? - We are! - Yeah, we are! Hey, you're a Thundergirl. Yeah, she was. Until shlearned that organizations like this are soul stealers! I-I, I don't understand. Did-did you get sep ""Oh, I-I don't understand."" -  Can I Just Did you get separated from your troop? No. My troop got separated from reality. Thundergirls are a sham! Yeah! Lay it on 'em, Teen! I used to be like you. This morning. I only cared about sashes and patches. Sashes and patches! Then I woke up. She woke the hell up! Okay. Maybe you kids should camp with us tonight. We have plenty of food I'd rather die! We don't need your food! Or your lies. Unless you have some cookies! And not the oatmeal ones! Never the oatmeal ones! Yeah! Even if they have chocolate chips in them, they're still oatmeal! The truth is, y-you're all just cogs in a cookie-sellining machine! Right. You're a cog, you're a cog, you're definitely a cog. You're more of a pawn. What? Honey, I think you're tired. And you're kind of dirty. I've never been more awake and dirty in my life. I hereby renounce my Tenderheart-level membership to the Thundergirls! Yeah! We're out of here! Yeah, and we're taking these. And this one. Good luck with your skit. Thanks. Oh, you're hogging all the blankets. - Come on. Get up. Come on. - Hmm? I'm leading us. Let's go. What are you talking about? Ow. Ow. You're sick! I'm not sick. Then what the hell is that? Wh-What? I'll tell you what that is: It's diarrhea and throw-up. You're firing from both ends. I studied the ballistics. It checks out. That was probably a bobcat. Oh, okay. You didn't eat a raw trout that didn't make you poop and barf your way through the forest like some kind of disgusting Hansel and Gretel. I'm taking charge here! We're gonna go! - Come on! This way now! - No. Not that way. It's this way. You don't even know what you're doing out here, Lin. I don't know what I'm doing? I fed myself ants and grubs and I made a wilderness hairbrush. Doesn't work, but still. Plus, you're sick, so let's go. I'm Nature Master now. You're never Nature Master! I'm Nature Master! I'll go back to camp this way and then we'll send help for you! Oh, come on. Just stick with me. You've got horrible diarrhea, Bob. You've got horrible diarrhea, Bob! Day one without the sash. Whew. Got to figure out who I am and what I'm going to wear diagonally - across my chest. - Seatbelt? - Bandolier? - Oh, yeah. And tonight, we take off your fingerprints. All right, people, let's move out! Got to find the kids. Got to beat Linda. Need strength. Got to find food. Kids! Kids! Mommy's coming! Whew! I'm headed for the Wang! I can see the tip! Oh, Bobby, why do you gotta be such a wang! Is that is that a nut? What are you, an acorn? If you're poisonous, tell me now. Hey! Get back here with my nut, you jerk. Well, well, well. It looks like the squirrel has become the idiot. Thanks for doing the heavy lifting, squirrels. Oh, boy. Get away from me! Get away from me! Aah! Aah! Don't eat me! I don't have the strength to fight. This is how I'm gonna die. This is taking forever. Hurry up and eat me. Linda?! That's my man! You get your paws off those nuts! Hi-ya! Ah-wa! Ya! Ah-whoo! You saved me! Yeah, I missed your stinky face. Hoyou fein', my little salmonella fella? Uh better. All empty. Sorry I-I left you back there. That was stupid. Oh, Bobby. Come on, let's go. Hey, Linda there are two Nature Masters: The one I left at camp I miss that one so bad but the other Nature Master is you. Aw. This is a fishing pole, this is a toothpick what the hell is this? You got to get that removed. What? That's, like, a huge wart. Don't look at that. Stop it. Come on, we got to get back to camp. Holy crap. We're here. Kids! Bobby, the kids are gone! - What? What? - They're in here! Yeah, hurry. We got fudge in here, too. Fudge. - Kids? - Gene. Tina. Louise. Where are you, babies? Where-where are you? Your kids aren't here. And neither is the fudge. - What?! - Your kids stole the fudge. Along with our inner tubes and our travel backgammon set. And a copy of our survivalist guide. Um, okay. I'm sorry about that, but where are they? We need to find them. We've been in the woods for, like, 40 hours. Well, we've been in the woods for 40 months. And we think you've got what it takes to join us. What do you say, Linda? Did our literature speak to you? What?! Who cares about any of that crud? We need to find our kids! Forget your kids. They're floating in very high quality inner tubes down a river eating fudge and playing backgammon. Um, all right, well, we're gonna go to them now, okay? Hold-hold on; Hold up. Ooh, is this bear mace? Why are you holding bear mace in my face? We need to know that you are ready to accept our invitation. Okay Let's put on our ""Ritual of Trust"" music. I'll get the trust lotion. They're not here. Now what? Let's get a tiny bit more fudge. Or a lot bit more fudge.  Everybody dance now What the hell is going on? What do we do? Shh. I've got an idea how to get us out of here. Just follow my lead. Okay! Here we go! Let's lotion up. Yeah! Great! You're the first ever to agree to the Ritual of Trust. This is gonna be so icy hot. Oh, it sure is, hon. Very sexual. - Whew! Yes. - I am looking forward to it. Can I just use your tiny restroom to freshen up? Trust me, you don't want any of this like this. Nah. Ew. Yeah, we smell like ass. Come on, Bobby.  Ooh, yeah, you tell me - It's too small. - Mom? - Oh, my babies. - Is that the kids? What are you guys doing? Uh, trying to escape. But not successfully. Go get help. Your father and I are being held hostage by the horny hermits. Hmm, I think I've got a plan. A plan bee. All right, Tina. This is all you. Just like unscrewing a lightbulb. Maybe this will help you. My sash! You knew I was always a Thundergirl deep down and would want it back. No! This is satin, woman. You don't just throw away satin! Maybe Thundergirls aren't completely useless in the wild. Maybe a bit of Thundergirl resourcefulness and a little bit of survivalist weaponized insects make for a perfect s'more of ideas. Turns out I'm a Thunder-vivalist. Tina, shush! Just do it! Oh, yeah, sorry. Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Thundergirl in the hole! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Bees! Ooh! - Whoa! -  They've weaponized insects! They took a page out of our own book. Page 17. Ow! I'm getting stung! That was your plan?! You're welcome. I'll Mace them! Oops. Camping is fun! Go, go. In the car! Bobby, your stuff. Forget the stuff! Gene, grab my Nature Master. Mm-hmm! Mm, mm, mm! You can't Mace a guy! Oh, well, you know what else you can't do? You can't take your wife camping for 40 months! You're right, honey. Come here. Come over here. Yeah. Here, Tina. It's a patch for keeping Mom and Dad alive. I don't think this'll count as an official patch but thank you. You did the Thundergirls proud, honey. And I never left them ever. - And no one can say I did. - Dad, your underpants. Thank you. Perfect underwear, perfect weekend. Uh, this isn't my underwear. More underwear for me then.  Rain! Rain! Flash! Flash!  Thundergirls wear a Thunder  girl sash!   Honor, friendship, trust, integrity   Ant Raid, sunscreen, skits and jelly beans   Thundergirls are bound to sing this   Song of nature, friends and things   I'll be a Thundergirl till I'm six feet under, girl, uh!   That's right, I'll be, I'll be a Th"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Why aren't you guys in costume? No one's gonna give you candy without a costume. Oh, is that how trick or treating works, Darryl? Yes. How do we get the candy? You put on a costume. Okay. And you go door to door. Oh, no we put on a costume! Relax! We've got the costume of costumes. No need for the attitude, Louise. I just don't want you to not have candy. I know, Darryl. Concern's coming from a good place. We're going as a Chinese Dragon. They'll be five of us inside. But we'll say there's ten of us. It's a trick to get more treats. We'll be swimming in nougat. I remember when I thought group costumes were a good idea. Too much work! And not enough friends. I'll admit, it's ambitious, but we have our best people on it. Why do we even have to do this? Come on, is it so hard to glue things? And run a restaurant? Yeah, it is. Well, this is what parents do. They glue crap on stuff for their kids so glue! I'm gluing. We got a lot of stuff. Glue, glue, glue! I said Glue! Please don't chant glue. And glue and glue and glue! I think I'm too old to trick-or-treat. Next year I'm going cold turkey. When you go from tween to teen, you say good-bye to Halloween. You're never too old for trick-or-treating. Or holding hands with dad. When I say ""Lou,"" you say ""Eez."" Lou! Oh, God. - When I say Lou, you say Eez! - Where is she? Lou Who's that? It's Millie Frock. She wants to be my friend or be me or be a rap duo with me. That's nice. No, it's not nice, Tina! It's not nice at all. Lou  Eez! Aah! No! Oh, hi, Louise. Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle. Stop it! What are you dressed as? Remember? Remember our plan? You don't remember our plan? You be dust, I'll be bunny. Dust bunny! That is not our plan, Millie. We didn't have a plan. And even if we did, even if we did get together and sit down, get some blueprints out, have a cup of coffee, why would I want to be dust? Dust! So you could be bunny? Why? That's exactly what dust would say. Good-bye. Can't help but notice you're not playing the Halloween Scream CD I gave you. Uh, you know, I didn't want to wear it out before the kids started coming around. Where is it? You have to Oh! - It's right there! Behind you! - Oh, great. Well, it can't play itself, Bob. You got to put it on and hit ""play."" Bobby, come on. Play the sounds of the holiday. Well, we don't need to right now, Teddy. - Why not? - We'll wait till the kids come. Why? Fine. I'll just put it in. Ooh. I'm spooked. Now you're all set for trick or treaters in a couple of hours. Wait, what time is it? Oh, my God, Bobby, the kids'll be home any minute! And the costume's not even close to finished. What are we gonna do? I don't know. How about let them finish it? Mort, Teddy, wh-what are you doing right now? Adjusting myself without anyone noticing. Watching Mort adjust himself. Grab some glue. Gonna be our Halloween elves! Come on, you don't have to be good, you just have to be fast. Why can't all women want that? All right, we'll go home, finish the costume and hit the streets. Oh, I need to grab the dragon eyes from the fort. Why are they in the fort? I spray-painted them in there. Fine, we'll swing by the fort. Yay! Fort, fort, fort! Fort? Hmm. I didn't peg you guys as the forting type. Oh, we fort. We fort big-time. After you. Uh I don't know. I got this thing about being in small spaces. Oh, you're gonna be fine, Darryl. Trust me. When you come out of here, you're gonna be afraid of this small space that is the world. Hey Lou Lou, where are you you? Oh no, no, no, no, no! She's right here. I'm looking at her. Shut up! Quick, inside! Hey, are we gonna play in the fort before we go trick-or-treating? 'Cause, uh Louise, you, you shut the door before I could even get in. Oh, sorry, Millie, we're at capacity, so You always say that. Now, come on, let me in! Yeah, ah, god, I sure wish I could but it's kind of a one-in, one-out situation. The fire marshal's on our ass. You understand, Millie. Well, I'll wait. Or-or you could come back later, too. We'll be here a while. It'll thin out in a bit. I'll get some more dust for our costumes! Dust bunny, think about it. Seriously, think about it. Okay, yeah. I'm knocking it around in my head right now. I think it's gonna be awesome! All right, Millie. It's gonna be great! Bye, babe. Ã¢â¢Âª La, la, la, la. Whew, that was close. Hurry up and get the dragon eyes before crazy comes back. This fort is amazing. I only feel a little claustrophobic. This would be a great place to go when my mom tells me to go play outside. All right, come on. We'll give you the quickie tour. This is Gene's room. There's some odor. Yes. Found them! And now the upstairs. There's an upstairs? Oh, yeah. This is Tina's room. - You can really feel the insecurity. - Hmm. Mm. I think it's nice. You don't think it's nice? No, no, it's nice. It's nice. VoilÃ. Parlor de la Louise. Lovely view. The light's bad for the upholstery. - True, fading it is an issue. - Yeah. So, what house will be the first stop on Tina's farewell trick-or-treating tour? Leave that to me. This town might suck at Halloween, but not if you have this. I give you the Treasure Trail. Whoa! Wow! It took phone-polling, mailing-lists, and a blog I follow called Candy Randy. So houses with stars are? Those are must-visits. And houses with an X? Must-avoids. I'm talking raisins, pencils, hand sanitizer, baby apples. Sayonara, raisins. Old grapes aren't candy! Do you guys hear that? What the? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Kids, kids inside! Precious kids! Yeah, Dino, I'm coming. I'm coming. I just parked. Yeah. I can leave it in the alley all night, no one ever comes back here. Yeah, I'm in costume. They were all out of Draculas so I'm a fruit head or something. Did he just say he's parking here all night? That's what he said! Oh, my God. We're trapped. Help! Weak spots find the weak spots! We can't be totally boxed in here. Concrete. Metal. - Concrete! - And truck. We're screwed. Until that truck moves. Which it's not until tomorrow! Oh, man, I'm starting to freak out here. Hello? It's later! Oh, Millie. Millie, Millie, Millie, Millie, Millie. Louise, you in there? I am! Millie, you have to get us out of here. Go for help! The truck pinned us in. Someone needs to move it! What?  Oh, yeah. Get the fire department! And the police! Just get everybody! Oh, sure! Hey, Louise. Hey, I was thinking, let's get bunk beds and live in the forest. wow. Or matching Murphy beds that fold up into trees! Millie, this is Gene! Hey, could you go for help? Oh yeah, I'm going to. Hey, when I say Lou, you say Eez. Lou! Eez. Okay. That was fun. You can go now. Lou! Eez. Okay, that is enough of that. Lou. Eez. That's plenty. Lou Eez, Eez, Eez! Go get some help, you frickin' nutcase! You creepy stalker psycho kook! Can you not understand a hint? Go get help! Oh, wow. I see. I see you don't like me, huh? Of course I don't! Who would? Who would?! What are you doing? Don't listen to her. This is Gene again. We think you're terrific. Did you do something with your hair? You look great. You seem real strong. You been working out? Louise, can you tell me this? If dust hits the ground and no one's around to hear it, does it make a sound? I don't know, Millie. No, it doesn't. So, I guess what I'm saying is have fun spending Halloween in a box. Good one, Millie. Silly Millie. That was good. How's it coming, Teddy? Great, Lin! All done. Teddy, is that it? Yeah, it's a dragon spike. For the back. Yeah, I know, Teddy. - You're supposed to have 20 done by now! - Oh. Bobby, how's that foot coming? Foot? I'm working on the tail. I'm doing the tail! You're supposed to do the foot! No, you said, ""Bob, do the tail."" I know because I remember thinking, ""You can't tail me what to do."" Teddy? That's funny. No, it's not! And I'm doing the tail! My tail's better than yours! Ah Yours is really good. Yeah, I know it is. All right, fine! I'll do the foot. Pass me the sequins. I would, but we're all out because someone that's my wife has no concept of how many sequins she's using! Are you talking about me? God, yes. Just go get some more! Fine! Great! This might not be a great time, but I also made a tail. We can not miss Halloween! This is all your fault, Louise! You were mean to Millie and now we're stranded! Yeah! She seems really cool. Okay, I'm hearing a lot of blame being thrown around loosey goosey right now. Ã¢â¢Âª Somebody's in friend jail Ã¢â¢Âª Somebody's in friend jail Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª And friend jail lasts forever. Ã¢â¢Âª Hey, Millie. Oh, don't mind me. I'm just collecting spiders for an experiment. Cool, I collect porcelain horses. I experiment with where I put them on my dresser. Well, this experiment is called ""see how much you freak out ""when I release spiders into the fort you're trapped in."" Seal it up, Gene! Seal it! I have a thing about spiders! You have a thing about everything! But especially spiders. They're scary. Andy's still in there! Let him out! We can't! Then we'd all get spidered! I'll never forget you, Andy. I'll be with you every time you look in the mirror. What? 'Cause we look alike. Never mind! Oh! No, I get it now! I didn't want those to be my last words! Why?! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What the? Hold on. Andy, get up. They're fake spiders. I thought I was a goner. I felt you die. Oh, my God. We're closed. What? No, no, no. I'm-I'm making a dragon. For my kids. We're-we're halfway through, We just need another bag to finish. When you wait until the last minute to buy art supplies, you pay the price! Harold! You heard her, Bob Fosse. We're closed. Bob Fosse? Look, I just need one bag. That's it. Oh! Bob Fosse doesn't need more than one bag. Oh! I'm not Bob Fosse! - I'm making a costume for my - Ooh. - Ooh. - I'm just taking these. Here's money. No, no! Ooh, Mr. Bob Fosse  just running away! Oh, no! Stop! Yes, I hear you honking! I'm just trying to make a costume for my kids! It's a dragon! Trick or treat! Oh, and what are you dressed as? We switched shirts. I'm Ollie. I'm Andy. Here's a rusted nine volt battery for you. - Ooh. - And a used coffee filter for you. Thanks. Happy Halloween. Want to trade? Yeah. This is a mockery! But I will take a coffee filter. Thanks. This isn't how I wanted to spend my last Halloween, Louise. I'm handing out batteries in a box full of Gene's farts. It's not fulyet! Uh-oh. Ow! Why is my butt wet? Butts get wet, Tina. It's what they do. Or maybe it's from that. Hmm. Must be garbage juice from the Dumpster next door. I'm getting pinto beans, some sandpaper Guys, we just found our way out. Gene, is she out there? What do you hear? Nothing. Except for Tina's breathing. You picking that up? Loud and loud. All right, Andy, Ollie. You two and me are the only ones small enough to fit through that hole in the Dumpster. I would go, but I'm master-minding this. So one of you two should go. Which one of you was born first? I was. I came in second. All right then, Ollie, squeeze into the dumpster, burrow through the trash, jump out and run for help. Just like when you came out of your mom. Got it? What did she mean by ""Came out of our mom?"" Okay, Ollie, get in there. Go, go, go, go. We just got to get out of here, man. Whatever it takes. Getting so cramped in here. Okay, you really don't need to take your pants off. I wish you were right. Oh, hi. Hi. Ow! How could Millie have possibly known about our plan? We whispered the whole time! Well, there's only one explanation, isn't there? One of you, in this room in this sacred fort is a rat! Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. One of you is. - Can you just tell me who it is? - No. Millie! So, which one of you is the rat? Tina, this is your last Halloween ever. You ratted us out to Millie so we'd never have to leave, didn't you? What? I-I want to get out more than anyone. My childhood is slipping through my candy-less fingers. Maybe Gene's the rat. Oh, please, let's just calm down and take a spray paint nap. Darryl, why are you wearing your backpack? Um Why are you wearing your backpack, Darryl? Answer the question. I just want to make sure I don't lose it. Oh, really? You don't want to lose it? Because you think you're getting out of here? I am! Millie, let me out of here! I did my part, you do yours! She's not letting you out, Darryl. You fool! Why would you do this? I'm weak, Louise. I'm weak. ""Dear Millie, I need candy. ""Also I will need to poo soon. Please let me out."" ""Dear Darryl, ""Help me help you poo. ""Be my man on the inside. Love, Millie."" I couldn't let the Treasure Trail go to waste! If you hadn't told her about our escape plan, we could have used our plan to escape! Oh, that's so obvious now, isn't it? I'm sorry it's hard for me to think when my pants are off. I just want candy! All right, all right. It's okay, Darryl. You didn't know what you were doing. Huh, buddy? No. My pants are off. Yeah. So, what do we do with a snitch? You did the crime, now you do the time. Andy and Ollie Burp 'n Blow. Poor bastard. That smells nice. You guys eat sherbet? Cucumber soap. I ate a flower. This is the one day you don't eat peanut butter and tuna for lunch? You ruined Burp n' Blow torture! It's pretty bad. It's not. It's fun. It's festive. - No. - It looks like it's from China. No, China would be furious about this dragon. They love dragons there. Hey, where are the kids? They should've been home by now. Oh, my God, they're lost! Not on Halloween! Lin, easy. They're dead. - No, they're not dead. - They're dead. No, I know it, they're dead. No, I bet they're in that fort they built. Ugh, that fort. Well, it is pretty cool once you get inside. What do you mean inside? They let you in? - I thought we weren't allowed. - I wasn't supposed to say anything. But it's great. Why can't I go in? I-I don't know, I And there's a ton of rules they have, so I guess that was one of them. Right, right, right, whatever. We're gonna go to that fort and we're getting those little should-be trick-or-treaters and we're shoving them inside this thing. Hey, you guys, I was just trick-or-treating! Mmm, this candy's so good. Oops, I dropped some. Good thing there's more where that came from. You monster! You can't do this to us! - Uh, it's just down here. - Yeah, I know where it is, Mr. I've Been In The Fort Before And You Haven't. That's right, I have. They were inside my fort for a long time. That's the original fort. Bob and Linda. Uh? Huh. Millie Frock. Louise's friend? Hey, you know, I just ran into Louise and Gene and Tina trick-or-treating. - What? - They're trick-or-treating without their costume? We've been slaving away all day! Where? Where are they? I don't know the name of the street, 'cause I'm a little kid. But if you follow me, I can show you. Skip like this. I don't want to skip. I said skip! Who is this kid? I like her. She's fun. So last year was my last Halloween and I didn't even know it. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to enjoy it more. And also, not to go into this fort. I wish I could go back ten seconds ago before I ate cardboard. Uh-oh, I'm doing it again. Hmm. Wait. Guys, take a look at this. What is it, rat? You see those buttons on the truck? Yeah. We just have to find a way to hit the ""up"" button and boom, the roof is lifted. And how exactly are we going to hit the button, huh? You gonna snitch on it? No, we use this. Darryl,, you're my favorite kind of rat. A rat with a hanger. Where'd she go? Whew, she's a fast skipper. So where are the kids? I don't see them anywhere. I'll tell you where they are. Not wearing their costume on Ungrateful Avenue. - Jerks. - We worked so hard on this thing. I fought the people at the art supply store. All that glue in my hair. - I hate to see it go to waste. - Yeah. Trick or treat! Oh, uh what are you supposed to be? It's a dragon, duh. It doesn't look like any dragon I've ever seen before. Yeah, well, your doo's spid. Yeah. Yeah. Aren't you a little bit old to be trick or treating? You're old. You're probably 60. I am 60 Hey! We gonna get any candy or not? No! You have to give it. Bob? No. Is that you? No. What? Who's? Bob. From the burger place. No. No way. I'm not I'd recognize you anywhere. I'm nine. That is hilarious. It's still not me. It's not me. That is hilarious. - Honey, come. It's Bob. From the burger place. - I can't We can't stay. Just stay-stay there Stay there. Stay there. - I can't. We actually have to go. - It's great. - It's great. It's Bob and Linda. - Bob, could you? - That's not From the burger place. - Nah. Honey, they're pulling some sort of I don't know - it's a prank or - Dave, I can't stay, I'm sorry. Ah, hi But good to see you. Steady - steady - I can't watch. Mostly because I can't see. You hear that? It's working! Uh You hit the wrong button! Turn it off! - Turn it off! - I can't! The hanger's stuck! Aah! We're all gonna die! Every meal I've ever eaten is flashing before my eyes! Oh, my god, my last meal was cardboard. This is not good for my claustrophobia! Wait, there's garbage. We could use it, we could stack it. Yes! Stack the strong stuff. Maybe we can stop this thing from crushing us. Ollie, Andy, get in there! It's working! Isn't it? Yes! The door! It's open! - Crawl to freedom! - Crawl to Halloween! Crawl to candy! My shoe! Now our shoes will be together! Whoa! We did it! We're alive! Whew, we've still got a few minutes left on the candy clock. What about our costume? Screw the costume. There's no time! We only got a few minutes left on the candy clock! Did you not hear me? But nobody will give us candy if we're not wearing one. Congratulations. You're a robot. Hold on, candy! I'm coming for you! Yeah! Treasure Trail lead us to treasure. Oh, come on! No! No! Turn them on! Turn them on! We're still here! Don't you go off on me! Aha! There you are. You think you're too good for your costume? For us? Costume? What am I even looking at? Godzilla's ding-dong? It's a dragon, Gene. It's not a dragon. Yes, it is. You asked to us to make you a dragon, we did. Wh-what are you? Bean can head? Yeah. No. Robot bean can head to you. Oh. Well, I bet we got more candy than you did, so neh. Wait, where is your candy? - Long story. - Actually, I could tell it pretty fast. Well, at least we can have some of yours. Nah-uh, bean heads. We get the candy. Yum, yum, yum, yum. No, we get the candy! It's ours! We're eating it all right now. - Never! - I want your candy! No! Get them! Get out of our dragon! I thought I was done with Halloween. But it turns out, Halloween's not done with me. Aah! Get out of our dragon! Okay, Halloween's over. I'm gonna eat more candy in front of you guys. But you can eat the mini boxes of raisins I didn't want. You'll need your strength to make it through the ni Oh, my God, I killed them! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! People are gonna be so mad at me. I'm gonna have to find a therapist. Oh, geez, I hope I like my therapist. You definitely won't. Who said that? The ghosts of us! This is Gene's ghost! Aah! We don't appreciate being killed! Boo. This is Tina's ghost. Oh, no. Oh, I didn't mean to kill you. I was just gonna keep you in there until you got old. Give us your candy, you nutcase. All of it? Or-or do you just want some of it? Or do you want to trade? All of it! Here, take it! Happy Halloween. Thanks for killing us. Heaven's nice."

Breadsticks! Well, I'm going to sleep. I'm exhausted from painting the town beige. What's that supposed to mean? I-I thought you liked Rudy's. Yeah, the first 15 times. Bobby, we almost never get to go out. Next time we should try something new. Look, we work hard, so on the rare occasion we take a little break, it's nice to know what we're getting. Whoa, Dad. Turn the romance down a notch, eh? Bob, I'm tired of us plopping down at Rudy's and eating soup, salad, breadsticks and fish. It's always soup and salad, breadsticks and fish. The type of soup changes. What was it tonight? Cream of something. Thank you, Tina. We need adventure or we're gonna shrivel up and die right in front of the kids. I call dibs on Mom and Dad's room! I call their clothes and jewelry! I call, uh, um, wait, what left? Dad's DVDs. Dibs! All the cards we've ever given Mom. Mine! This is all happening so fast. Put your seat-backs and tray tables up 'cause we're about to take off! Okay. Seaplane flying lessons? What's a seaplane? I want to say it's a plane you can see, but that can't be right. I was at the market and I took this flyer out of a woman's shopping cart, and I signed you and me up for flying lessons. First lesson's free! Aren't you excited? Uh, no. I hate flying on big planes. Why would I want to go on a smaller, even less comfortable plane? Are you doing that thing where you're mean to seaplanes because you really like seaplanes? Pullin' on their hair. Let's just stick to good ol' Rudy's. No! No, no, no! No more boring dates! We need adventure, excitement! We're flying. Look at me No, Lin. Come on, give me your hand. Come on! No, I don't No. Lin, stop. I'm not going on a seaplane. Look out. Look out for the bird. Uh-oh, there's a balloon. How'd that get up here? I'm not in the air. Oh, look at the town from up here. I don't see anything. I'm on the ground. I see it. The people look like ants. No, wait, those are ants. And that's where Ma lives and Pa. I told you, I didn't go in the plane. I'm not with you. Fine! Then I'll go on our adventure by myself! You go to Rudy's and have a cannelloni all alone-y! Oh, my! She just rhyme-burned you. Put some lotion on that. Yoo-hoo. I'm here for the seaplane lesson. Are one of you fellas the flight teacher? Oh, not me, I'm old. But if you're looking for a father figure, look no further, young lady. Aw. No. Fair enough. Hi there. I'm Kurt. Nice to meet you. I'm Linda. This was supposed to be a couple's lesson but my husband's being a jerk. I-I mean, he didn't want to come. I-I mean, h-he couldn't come. Too bad. His loss. I'll go. Gus? Just kidding. I know I'm not allowed to go. Well, let me introduce you. - Linda, this is Shoshana. - Oh. She's a 1968 Sweetnam Eagle that I rebuilt by hand. She's 45 years old, but she looks 30 and she handles like she's 18. Oh, if I die today, I want that on my headstone. I love it. Go ahead and grab ahold of that yoke. Now, once that little needle reaches 60 knots We're flying! No, you're flying. Oh! I'm flying! I am flying! You're a great teacher, Kurt. You're great for noticing. I am flying. Better than breadsticks! I haven't heard that one but okay Uh, hi, Mr. Fischoeder. Shh, shh, shh. Quiet, Bob. All right, see you in hell, Roger! What? This is the only spot I get good reception. Ooh, is someone taking flying lessons? Yeah, our mom. Poor Bob. I had no clue you and Linda were on the rocks. We're not. You're not not on the rocks. Ah, denial. A woman doesn't take flying lessons from Upskirt Kurt because she's satisfied in her marriage. Wait, what are you talking about? Who's Upskirt Kurt? Oh, yeah, I've heard of that guy. The macho seaplane pilot who beds bored housewives. What do you mean ""beds""? He makes their beds? No, Gene. Kurt is seducing your mommy. Hmm I hope he's a good listener because that bird likes to chirp. All right, knock it off. I-It's just a flying lesson. With Upskirt Kurt. Look, you know what's happening right now? She's cramped in a way too small space, nauseous from diesel fumes and this guy's B.O. You just described her life with you. Trust me, she is hating it. Whoa! I wouldn't be too sure, Bob. See, uh, Kurt has a certain aphrodisiac he utilizes. Aphrodisiac? Yes, yes. First, he pretends there's a problem with the plane What's th Wh-what's that sound? What-what's that sound? Are we okay? Huh, that's odd. We're losing altitude. - Radio's dead. - Wha-what? What's going on? What's happening?! We're okay, but we're going down. Then a fake emergency landing on an uninhabited island. Quippiquisset Island, to be precise. But the locals call it ""Quicky Kiss-it."" Why do they call it that? It's a make-out island. Where people go to make-out. That's why I want to get a kayak. - Quicky Kiss-it? - Mm. Emergency landing? That cannot work. It could, Bob. Look at Castaway. Tom Hanks falls in love with a volleyball. It works. Kurt's a hero, and the bored wife is putty in his big, strong hands. Oh, I didn't know he had big, strong hands. Or putty. We're gonna die! I've never died before and I'm not about to start now. The bored wife cheats death, then cheats on her husband. That's the power of adrenaline, kids. Oh, you should teach at my school. And you should work in my coal mine. Got to go. Sorry about your marriage! So, so sorry, Bob. Look, I really don't think a professional flight instructor is going around faking emergency landings, Teddy. Bah. You're probably right. Linda, look at me. Huh. We're gonna be okay. Huh. I'm gonna set her down nice and easy. Okay. Oh, God, the engine! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Just got to point the nose down - into a controlled dive. - Oh! - We're gonna crash! - No, we're gonna flare. Wait for the plane to settle onto the water. Just like a duck on a pond. O-kay. D-Duck, duck, duck, duck. Oh, duck, duck, duck, duck. Duck! Duck! Duck! Quackity, quackity! Quackity, quackity! Duckity duck! You did it! We're alive! Oh, Kurt, you saved us! I did. I really did. I guess between my training and my instincts, uh Okay. Oh, God. I've got mouthwash around here somewhere. Upskirt Kurt what a nickname. I mean, it rhymes, for one. Is Mom wearing a skirt? I can't remember. What did she wear today? - Maybe he supplies the skirts on the plane. - All right, knock it off. Your mom isn't being seduced right now. And I shouldn't have to say that to my kids. Well, you did get into a big fight with her earlier. And shouldn't she be back by now? She should Oh, God. All right, you know what? Let's go down and meet her at the docks. Not like I'm worried but just because I We should see the docks. Ah, nothing like seeing a good dock, right, Dad? Mm-hmm. Uh, excuse me, sir. I'm looking for my wife. She's taking a flying lesson. She may or may not be wearing a skirt. Oh, my goodness, this is awkward. Uh, what? Wh-why? Nothing. So, flying lesson, huh? Uh, yes, she's, uh she's supposed to be back by now. Gosh. I-I just don't normally see the husband. Or the kids. Jeesh. Real life comes up and hits you in the face. Uh, okay, uh, all right. Uh, maybe we should go check out the island. You know, just to be safe. Uh, sir, how do we get to, um, uh Quicky Kiss-it Island. It's called Quippiquisset. And I have no idea. I guess the best way to get there is to crash a seaplane. What are you doing here, Bob? Shouldn't you be rescuing your bride? Uh, um, I'm trying to get out there. Someone's got to have a boat for hire around here. What do you think this is, Key West? Everybody's just got a boat? This guy thinks everywhere is Key West. Take the ferry to King's Head Island. Maybe there you'll find this colorful, fictional boat-for-hire that you're looking for. Yeah, it's got to be colorful, right, Dad? Okay, yeah, the ferry. L-Let's do it. Ticktock, Bob. Upskirt Kurt moves faster than this. He's not called ""Kurt the Long Slow Courtship Guy."" She's not cheating on me! Okay Well, what do we do now? The radio's dead. No one knows we're here. Can you fix the plane? Maybe. The engine's still too hot though. We'll have to wait it out. Man, I'm parched. Prosecco? Ooh, I love champagne. It's, uh, Prosecco. What? Oh, God. These bubbles make me burp. You always fly with champagne? Prosecco. I was gonna take my mother on a picnic after our lesson. She lives upstate. I love her dearly, and she loves picnics. Aw. But since we're stranded, we'll need the energy. Do you like cheese? I love cheese. Almost dying really makes you hungry. It does. But I promise you, I'll find us a way off of this rock. - Got any mozz? - Hey, let's get out of the sun so we don't dehydrate. There might be a shady meadow over that hill. And maybe go a little easy on the cheese. Mmm. Oh, it's good. Wow, you were right about the meadow. Hey, look, a lute! I always wanted to play one of these. The hell's a lute? If anything, I was sharp because you were flat. Or I was perfect. So long, mainland! My island name will be Daiquiri Zachary. When you're not pouring drinks, you're solving mysteries. Quicky Kiss-it? Can there really be a whole island for kissing? Ah  Quicky Kiss-it  Quicky Kiss-it  Quicky Kiss-it  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah  Quicky Kiss-it  Ooh, Quicky Kiss-it  La, la, la, la, la, la, la. Whoa. Dad, what's gonna happen when you see Upskirt Kurt? Are you gonna punch him? I'm not punching anyone, Louise. Dad's not a fighter, he's a yeller. - An old yeller. - Normally I'd agree, but we're talking about Dad's woman. I think it gets physical. I'm sure nothing is happening on that island. - Mr. Fischoeder! - No! Why didn't you say you had a boat?! I have a boat! There. Are you happy? No! Bye! Uh, excuse me, can you, uh, take us to Quippiquisset Island? AKA Quicky Kiss-it Island. Where the currency is kisses and everyone is rich. That's my daughter. Well, I can take you as far as here. That's my mail route. Uh, great. That'd be great. No one lives on Quippiquisset, so no one sends mail there. Just neckers and canoodlers on Quippiquisset. Hmm. Um, okay. And gropers. Huh. Got it. We'll, uh we'll take the ride right away. Something about Quippiquisset just makes people horny as hell. Hmm. Okay, thank you. Here, have a grape. They're juicy. Nah, I got the stuff grapes grow up to be right here. Well, I've got the stuff boys grow up to be right here. Okay You think the engine's cool enough to check on now? Hard to say. There's a lot of heat on this island. The heat of the engine, the heat between you and me, us What are you doing? Giving in. Join me. Giving in? What? We just had a brush with death. Our adrenaline and our endorphins are running wild let's go with it! No! No, no, no! My endorphins want to go home. Really? Well, my endorphins think we should take turns kissing each other's faces. You go first. Okay, I'll go first. Whoa. Kurt, wrong idea. Cool your engines right now, buddy. Isn't this what you want? Adventure? Linda, you asked the universe for help, and it gave you me. Namaste. Captain, you are not cleared for landing, capisce? Kiss me, Linda, and we can fly lying down. Ow! What the hell? Wow, that really works. Why would you head-butt me? I was gonna punch you, but I'm holding wine. I can't believe you're rejecting me. Yeah, I'm married, you idiot. So are all my other clients. Ugh! Everything was going perfectly. What do you mean? We crash-landed. Kinda. You didn't! Ow! Stop it! That's for faking an emergency. And since there's nothing wrong with the plane, let's go! Now! Fine. Let me just put the lute back. That there is Quippiquisset. Good day for neckin'. Don't kiss anybody, Linda! Not that I think you would. Don't get pregnant! I want to be the baby! No! Do get pregnant! I want a brother! Or maybe get a dog first, to practice? You guys want to read some mail, take your mind off of things? All right, where'd you hide your dumb flying boat? Oh, no! No! No, no, no, no. Seriously, where's the plane? I don't know! It must have floated away! What?! How the hell does that happen? The tide came in! So now we're stuck here?! My plane! Oh, my God, oh, my God, my plane! Ow! You-you turd! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on! Help! Someone get me off this stinkin' island! We're gonna starve out here, all because you thought I was so bored of my marriage that I would have sex with some slimy seaplane pilot. - Unbelievable. - No. We're gonna starve 'cause you ate all the cheese. I bet that picnic wasn't even for your mother. Doy, Linda. Look, I'm not gonna apologize for giving women what they want. Women do not want to be tricked into having sex. Well, when you say it like that, it sounds gross. Listen, buster, you stay on your side of the island, I'll stay on mine. Wait, switch sides; that side's better. Well, this is as far as I can take you. Time to reseal some of these envelopes. Definitely a federal offense. Nope, think you're wrong there. - Not if you seal 'em back up. - Right, yep. - You're not gonna go tellin' - on me, are ya? Nope. We got to find a way to get to Quippiquisset. Dinghy for four? Whoa, whoa, but that's not ours. Come on, Dad, suck it up. We got to get to Quicky-Kiss-it before he quicky-kisses Mom. Sheesh, this island's seen a lot of emergency landings. Hey, Linda? What, Kurt?! You got every right to hate me. Now that I've had a little time to think, I hate me, too. Yeah, 'cause you're a jerk. I'm pathetic. I chase bored housewives. Why? Because I don't have any love in my life. No, you don't. I know, I don't. I know. I like to think there's someone out there for everyone, but, uh but Okay, all-all right. O Uh, I know. O I know. Shh Okay, shh, stop it. Stop it. All right, come on. All right, don't be such a baby. There's probably somebody out there for you. Some freak. Hey! What's wrong with you? Your hands are soft. Rub my breasts. No! Why is rowing so hard? Are we even moving? Tidal wave! Here comes another one. What is with these waves? They just keep coming! There she is! Linda! Bob? Kids? You found us! Kids, stay in the boat. It's a dinghy. Get your hands off her, Upskirt Kurt! Huh? My-my hands are nowhere near her. I don't understand. Easy, friend. We're not friends! You think we're friends? Yes, I do. Are you seeing how tan this guy is? That's all I'm seeing. Careful, Dad. Watch out for his big, strong tan hands. Hey, hey, guy. Let me tell you something guy! In a second. I just got to catch my breath. Rowing is really hard. But you make it look so easy, Dad. No, you don't. You look horrible. Oh, God, Mom's gonna leave you for Kurt. Ah-ah-ah-ah, stay on your side. Ah Ow! You punched my butt! What is it with you people? What were you even aiming for? I don't know. The rowing really killed me. I can't raise my hands very high. Lin, did he try anything? Oh, yeah, couple times. But I smooshed his face like this. Eh! Call her off, call her off! Hey, look, it's Mr. Fischoeder. Wha? Mr. Fischoeder! Bob? Is that you? You look macarooned. We are! Help us! Look what I found! Shoshana. Eh, Sho-shove it! Ha! Ow! Well, climb aboard if you want a ride. Can we ride in the plane? Sure. Okay, just wipe your feet off. Aah! Sorry to leave you, Quicky Kiss-it. We both know you haven't seen the last of Tina Belcher. So how was the lesson? Great. Yeah. This is way better than Rudy's. Huh? Bottomless salad bowl looking a little better now, huh, Lin? Aw, go suck on a crouton! So, how many horses you got under the hood? Uh I think about a thousand. Is that a lot? Oh, that's a lot. Let's see. Yee-hah! Whoa, that boat can really zoom. Aah! Buckle your seat belts, kids! ; It's getting a little bumpy. And a little fly-y! Holy crap! We're lifting off! And we are airborne, people! Yay! I got in the Mile High Club! Early admission! Hey! We got to tell them to slow down! Hey! Where's the horn on this thing? There's no horn. You should really lower the plane, guys. We know, Tina! I mean, because of that. Bridge! Oh, it's also got a stereo. Oh! All right! The plane's not lowering. We're going too fast. Then we got to go up. We got to go over the bridge. - How? - We have to cut the towrope somehow. Gene, hand me that toolbox. Oh, come on, there's nothing in here but massage oil and a wine opener. - Wine opener! - Ding! Thank you, Louise! This is no time for wine, Dad! Oh, man. You're going out there? Yes, Louise, I'm going out on the wing of an airplane. It's called a pontoon! Pontoon! And that's called a bridge. Oh, Bobby, this is crazy; don't go out there. I have to! Okay, I can do this. Aah! Bobby, be careful. I'm trying! But also hurry, please. Yes, thank you for that! Oh, Bob, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said you were boring. - I should never have signed up for this. - No, Lin, I'm sorry. I know we should go on better date nights. I Maybe you should just have this conversation later! Yeah. She's right, she's right. I agree! That would be best!  Figaro, Gigolo, Figaro, Gigolo   Gigolo, Figaro, Figaro, Gigolo  Did you save us yet, Dad? Not yet, Tina. How about now, Dad? No! I'm trying to do it! How much progress have you made? It's not a real knife, - And I'm on the wing of a plane! - Pontoon! Just a percent, a percent. It's looking pretty grim, Dad! Just sayin'. The constant questions aren't helping! Wait, wait, almost got it. Oh, boy. Bridge, bridge, bridge, bridge, bridge! Linda, hit it! Go up! Aah Are you still there, Bob? Yes! I want to be inside now, though. Dad! Dad! Dad! Oh, Bobby! You rescued us! That was close. Oh, you're my hero. Oh, it's okay, I puked, too. Linda, you're flying. I know, right? Wait. Can you land? I mean, did you learn that? No. Oh. Oh. Well that might be an issue. Oh. That's odd. What? Never mind. Okay. Oh, I think I know what to do. Kurt was faking it, but I watched him take this thing down. Then do that. Yeah. Now. Do it now! I am. Just got to act like we're going to crash Crash?! Why are we gonna act like we're doing that? Here we go. Uh, this should work. It's not working! I can do this. I feel like Amelia Earhart. Oh, God, she died. I feel like a regular captain on a regular plane. What the? And flair mama! Shoshana, Shoshana, oh, oh, oh, oh, God, God, God, oh! Looks like Kurt's trying to land with his penis again. Yes! How are we alive?! 'Cause your mom is incredible! Flying's the best! Why do we drive anywhere? Best date ever. Whoo! I have so much adrenaline pumping through my veins. Me, too. Oh, it really puts me in the mood, Bobby. Oh. Yeah, me, too. Yeah. Crash-landing really is an aphrodisiac. Kids, uh, swim to shore. Your father and I are gonna have a ""Proshecco"" picnic. Prosecco. Oh, yeah, that. Okay. Bye, Tina. Tina, uh, come back. We were joking. Remember, do your ice cream scoops. Ooh, now I'm hungry for ice cream.  Quicky Kiss-it  Quicky Kiss-it  Quicky Kiss-it  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah  Quicky Kiss-it  Whoo! Quicky Kiss-it  She's kissin', she's kissin'  She's kissin' so quick  Quicky Kiss-it  Ooh! Quicky Kiss-it  Uh-huh, Quicky Kiss-it  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah"
"All right! My Bobby's going off to college. I'm not going off to college, Lin. You don't have the grades! I'm-I'm just going to the college to fill in for Pepe, cooking at the fraternity house for a week. Aw, you're gonna have so much fun. Yeah, I don't really see what's fun about being ordered around by a bunch of frat boys. I can explain it. That's okay, Tina. All I know is we need the cash. So I'm doing it. Well, you're gonna miss me hosting one of Gretchen's LadyGood parties. What are ""lady goods""? I don't know. Makeup? Tampons and pony saddles? Breast organizers? Okay, well, guess I'd better go feed Chad and Trip and Chip and Skip and all the other rich kids. You say that like we're not rich. Wait, Dad. Are we not rich? Hi. I'm the cook. I'm filling in for Pepe? Uh, looks like you guys got TP'd. Yeah, the Alpha House likes to prank us. Joke's on them, though. Free toilet paper for us! Oh, yeah. Tough to roll it back up, though. I'm the Beta president. They call me Pud. Oh, okay, Pud. I'm Bob. That's Hefty Jeff he's the fraternity historian. Oh, uh, that's a thing? Ask me anything about the history of this frat. Uh, okay. When was it founded? Crap. Ask me something else. I'm Turd. Put her there. Hey, Turd. So Turd, Pud, um, Hefty Jeff. This is, uh a nice place you got here. Thank you. I mean, the sofa is upside down, but That's for hiding. And forts! Yeah. Okay. So, I'm guessing this isn't the top fraternity on campus. Oh, no. Our motto is ""If you rushed us, you'd be pledged by now."" Hey, worked on me. We haze with hugs. Some good huggers in this group. Girls never come here. How we doing, ladies? Let's give it up for Linda for hosting tonight's LadyGoods party! Stop it. Now that everyone's hammered, let's look at the product line. Do you think it's appropriate to have the children here? Why wouldn't it be appropriate? Our money's as green as yours, toots! Our first LadyGood is called the Joie de Vibe, which we all know is French for ""fun."" Ha, ho! I don't know what that thing is, but the look on Mom's face is hilarious! I'll buy it! Okay, kids. Come on. Go to your room now. Yeah, go to your room, guys. You, too, missy. What? Come on. Out now. Oh, man! Grown-up stuff is going on! Ah - Okay. I love it! - I want a magic vibrating club just like any other boy! - Yeah. All right. - Yeah! Bob, this burger is superb. What'd you put in there? Spices? Uh, a few. You deserve a beer. Follow me to the Fellowship Room.  Fellowship Room! Fellowship Room! So fellowship basically means drinking. And drinking games. Like Beer Beer Goose. What's the ""Slowhand Crooner Corner""? Oof, Slowhand. Yeah, seriously. Someone's got to tell him he graduated a million years ago. Now, now, Hefty Jeff, Turd. Slowhand is a very generous Beta alum. He buys us stuff like that karaoke machine. Uh, and what's that? Beta! Beta! Beta! That's Beta. Yeah, I got that. Beta was the house iguana from '67 to '86. Only a true brother may drink from him. You drink from him? I ate Indian food out of him once. You're not supposed to. We're out upstairs. Oh, hey, Bob. Did you drive here? Uh, yeah. Why? Maybe it's time to ""go to the library."" Tonight? We're supposed to wait. Bob can drive. And we're the perfect level of drunk. To go to the library? Yeah. Could you give us a ride to campus? I can't drive at night 'cause I don't have a car. Okay. Moving on, this one is called Here Comes the Sun. It's solar-powered so you leave it on your porch all day. Any takers? No? Okay. Linda. Linda. What, what, what? I'm dying here. This crowd is all married, boring people who suck. You got to help me. What? No. I can't sell anything. I can't s You'll be fine, you'll be fine. Linda swears by this thing, don't you, Linda? You know, because of your problems with your husband? Yeah! Uh, Bob's got a condition that makes him, uh, sex bad. My husband's got that. It's called being married for 20 years. Being married for 20 years! She says being married! Ah I'll take the one with the hand crank, for camping. Okay! Who wants more wine? So, where's the library? It's just up ahead. I'm really nervous. The library must be different than how I'm imagining it. Stop here. Okay, uh, this isn't the library. At all. Hey, would you mind waiting here? And keep the engine running. What are they doing with that fish and that air conditioner? Oh. They're putting the fish in the air conditioner. That's a good prank. Kind of. No, it's not. Yeah, we did it! Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

You're off to the frat house already? Yeah, the guys are playing Beer Beer Goose, so I'm gonna make lunch. You know, now I kind of regret not going to college. You regret not going to college? Come on. It's not like you ended up flipping burgers. Oh, wait Why don't you take the kids with you? A house full of boys? I can't go. I have plans. Just kidding. Let's go. Hey! There he is! Everybody, Bob's here! Uh, hey, guys. I brought my kids. This is great. I can't not step on cold pizza. Upside-down couch for hiding? And forts. This is the biggest man-cave ever. And Tina's going spelunking. Hey, Bob. Slowhand's here. Slowhand? Oh, oh, the alum? Yeah, he's in the bathroom. Shh, guys, I think he's coming. Comin' back from the bathroom entrance music! Dr. Yap? I thought I'd never see you again until my next dental appointment. You're Slowhand? Bob, what are you doing here? I'm filling in for the cook. Oh, great, great. Hi, kids. How are you doing? Are you flossing, Beana? Yap, yap, yap, yap. Hey, you signed up for the Slowhand Memories Tour? Actually, I should get into the kitchen. Leaving now! Keep up! and that's where I had my first French hug. That's where you feel a girl's armpits. We done, Yap? We've hit every room in the house. Not every room. Behind this very door are Betas' greatest treasures, our darkest mysteries and our washer-dryer. Pause for laughter. Only brothers may enter the Room of Secrets, Secrets, Secrets, Secrets. Shh. You kids want to see inside, huh? Sure. No! What did I tell you? Brothers only. Okay, Yap, we get it. Moving on. Last stop. That was the last stop. You said that was the last stop. Yap, yap, yap, yap. One more. There's one more thing. Yeah, the best way to keep your secrets hidden is to put 'em in a room labeled ""Room Of Secrets."" Damn it! And finally, the Beta House Wall of Honor. Hey, wait a second. What's this? Whoa, Hefty Jeff, you framed that already? I'm the house historian. His dad owns a frame shop. Are you freaking kidding me?! Slowhand, calm down. No, you calm down, Pud! You let a non-brother drink out of Beta?! And he crooned in my Crooner Corner? ""B"" to the ""S""! It's okay. Bob helped us prank the crap out of the Alphas. You'll prank with these guys but you won't prank with us? We put the dead fish in their AC. What?! That was my prank! Why wasn't I in on my prank? You should have called me! I put my number in all of your cell phones. Bob had a car, the fish was starting to smell I bought that fish! That's why when I have a fish I write my name on it in permanent marker. Sorry, Yap. I didn't know it was your fish. You're right, Slowhand, we screwed up. If you want to take time off from hanging out here, we would understand. No, that won't be necessary. The important thing is you guys finally sacked up and pranked those Alphas. Yeah, Operation Bob-Fish was a huge success. Yap-Fish! It was a Yap-Fish! History will say it was a Bob-Fish. I'm so proud of my dad. That stuff about Bob's problems in the bedroom was great. You are a natural saleswoman. Thanks! Selling's easy. You just tell lies about your husband and you're all set. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Throw it all out. What? Different crowd. See that woman crying over there? Yeah. The one with too much eye shadow. Oh, it's awful. No, I know. Anyway, she just got dumped. You tell me why. Aw. Her friends threw her this party. Right. Think you got an angle for her? Maybe. Yes. I don't know. Good. Save it. Okay. Let's go sell some sex toys! Ow. Ow. What? And Linda? Here. Your own Pleasureologist coat. Aw! Welcome to the Pleasureologist family. Hey. Listen, sweetie. I just broke up, too. Huh? Yeah. I broke up with my husb my boyfriend. Oh, yeah? Bob. Jerk. But guess what. I found somebody better. The Sneaky Pete! Oh, hi, it's nice to meet you. What's your name? I'm Susan. Susan, hi. Hi, Pete. I like you, Susan. I got a crush on you. I never felt this way before. I want to go home with you with your bedside drawer and live there forever. Oh, now she's smilin'. We got another one! Tell her about the holster. Dad, what do you think the frat boys keep in their Room of Secrets? I don't know, Tina, but whatever it is, it attracts ants. Well, don't you worry. Today we're getting in or Gene dies trying. You got it! Guys, you heard Dr. Yap. That room is off-limits to non-brothers. You're not a brother. I'm basically a brother. I'm more of a brother than you are, Gene. You've never even touched the iguana! I drank from its ass! Are you okay, Dad? I just I like those guys. And-and they like me. And it's not just because we're always drunk. Oh, my God. Dr. Yap! What happened here? The Alphas hit us, man! They got us, man! Pretty hard, bro! This could be payback for Operation Bob-Fish. Yap-Fish. And the worst thing is they took they took A long, hard look at your lifestyle? No! They took Beta! Beta! No! I want everyone to see what the Alphas did to me. What happened, Slowhand? I just came by the house with a new karaoke CD Steady Rocking Booty Jams. Volume Two. Suddenly, the Alpha president barged in with his foot soldiers. First they held me down and shaved me, then they flung me over here, and shoved me over there, and beat up my face! And then they took Beta! Oh, and they left this. No, no, no, no, no! Friggin' Alphas! They have no respect for anything! I'm gonna go pee out the window. You pee out the window? I'm going to college! Poor Beta. You drank out of his butt. What are the standards here? In my day, if the Alphas hit us, we hit 'em back twice as hard! Brothers, this is war. And if that means I need to move back into the house for the foreseeable future, so be it. And it does mean that. Oh okay. Get my room ready, Turd! I'm in. Not I mean, not to move in. But to help. We won't probably won't need you at all, Bob. I'll do I'll do whatever. I'm in it for the long haul, brothers! Yeah, we need Bob now more than ever! Yeah! Bob's one of us! All right, it's All right, it's fine. Thanks, Bob. You're in. Let's get 'em! Yeah! Let's get 'em! Yeah! Yeah, go get 'em! Take your time, don't come back for a while! Betas! Room of Secrets, time to spill your guts!

""Due to reports of property damage, ""Beta Upsilon Pi fraternityis. Signed, Dean Dixon."" Stupid Dean Dixon! I hate that guy! Is it a guy? He's the dean. He's nice. Well, probation or not, this isn't over until we show the Alphas they can't get away with disrespecting our lizard. What about Dean Dixon's letter? Shouldn't we lay low? Turd's got a point. Thank you. I'm one semester away from graduating. Oh, Pud, there are no jobs out there. You know that, right? Listen to Bob. Even though he's technically not even a brother. Well, if Bob's on board You know I'm on board, T-bird. Yeah, B-bow. The B-T express! Choo choo! We're coming to awesome town! Okay, yeah Just two passengers today, Turd and Bob! Brother Brothers, and not-really brothers, I give you Operation Spit Take. Wow. Wow. If I can't get the secrets out, I'm gonna put my secrets in. I have a cat under my bed. I've had it for eight months. I know about Gene's secret cat. I can't believe we'll never know what secrets are in the Room of Secrets! Or what laundry is in the Room of Secrets. Wait a minute. If the building's old and crappy, there might be a laundry chute. Oh, that's weird. I was correct. Ladies. Whoo-whoo-hoo! Let's check out some secrets. I'm good. Tina! Yeah? Those aren't yours. Oh, how-how'd these get on? Tonight, none other than Dean Dixon is hosting a banquet recognizing campus community service. And their guest of honor? Guess who. It's the president of those iguana-thieving Alphas! Getting a special award for their so-called ""dedication to raising thousands of dollars for cancer research."" Boo! But what this douchebot doesn't know is that an award for fighting cancer isn't all he's going to get tonight! Yeah, not if the Betas have anything to do with it. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! To the Beta-mobile! We've got Alphas to crush! Oh, crap, the kids. Uh, you guys g-go ahead. I'll meet you there. Uh, Betas! Check out the past brothers. Mmm, if those sideburns could talk. Here's a magazine about jugs. Their secret is they love pottery? Did I mishear them? Is this actually called the Room of Suck-rets? No, I think we heard them correctly. It's the Room of Secrets. Well, these secrets suck! Oh, here's Dr. Yap's class. It's Beta! And a bunch of tiny clothes. Oh, Beta's starting his own fashion line. No, dummy. This means the Alphas never stole the iguana! Hey, you guys aren't supposed to be in Beta? We found him in the wall behind Dr. Yap's class photo. Why would Beta be here in the house? Unless Yap made up that whole story. He wouldn't. He would. He would. He would. Who would? Dr. Yap. Oh, yeah, he would. Oh, my God. We have to stop him before he gets those kids kicked out of school. It's all right, they can move in with us. Dibs on Turd. I can't believe it. Yap made up the whole thing? He's been pranking his own frat! It's the ones you least suspect. Sometimes. Not this time. Oh, good, Bob. I thought you might have wussed out. You're just in time to see the Alphas pay for taking Beta. I know what you did, Yap. It's over. Recognize this iguana? Recognize this iguana tail? Or these briefs? Just curious. They're mine now. Okay, Bob, you got me. I took Beta. I thought a prank war would bring the brothers together and show them how much I mean to them. So it wasn't the Alphas at all. Those damn Alphas don't even know we exist. Yeah, they seem pretty focused on their charity work. I've been TPing our house for years just to get this thing going. Okay, this fake prank war ends now. The brothers are already on probation, Yap. Prank the Alphas here and you'll get the house shut down. So what? They'll be legends! Oh, no. What's the prank, Yap? Well, since you're too late to stop it, I'll tell you. First, I dressed as a waiter and snuck into the banquet while they were setting up. Oh, my God, how long is this story? Then I drilled a hole in the stage, and underneath I planted the splatter-master saliva keg! The what? Are you insane? I don't know. Is it insane to collect the spit of every patient who's passed through my office for the past six months and put it in a pony keg? Absolutely. Not necessarily. Hmm No. Right now, all the Betas are under the stage with the keg, waiting for that Dean Dixon to introduce his Alpha lapdog. And when the Alpha president steps up to the podium? Sploosh. This is a great plan. We're doing this! No, we're not, Louise. Come on, Yap. No! It's all so easy for you, isn't it, Bob? You just moseyed into the Beta house and stole their hearts with your hamburgers and your perfect body. Yap, I'm sorry, okay? And I get it. The fraternity's great. It's like being in a family of guys with beer and karaoke. Sucker punch! We're definitely switching dentists! No! You'll never get a better family dentist who's in your provider network! Hello, I'm Dean Dixon, and you're all expelled. Just kidding. Except for you, you're expelled. Just kidding. Oh, God. He started his intro. I've got to do something. You're too late, Dad. You'll never stop it now. I've got to try. Uh, now I'd like to introduce a truly outstanding young man Me! Hello! I am the honoree's, uh, twin brother. Hmm? But I'm 20 years old. Excuse me. Uh That's okay, Dean. Thanks. Have a seat. You know what I like about my brother? He's nice. He-he wouldn't hurt a fly, much less I don't know, I'm just naming animals here an iguana. Boo! Please have her removed. I want everyone in the room to know, even people who might be under the stage right now, that the Alpha president would not hurt or kidnap an iguana. Right? Maybe he would! No, he wouldn't! Those are the kind of things our crazy oldest brother would do, though. You know, our crazy, Asian dentist older brother? I'd point him out, but I have a slow hand. A slow hand. Dad should leave the jokes to Dean Dixon. Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Come on, help Dad out. Are you talking to us? Don't set off the spit keg. Um, let's go out and ask him what he means. Hi. How are you? Excuse me, who are these young men? I probably should have come to rehearsal. No, Yap, no! Dad, um, you've got a little On your Bit right here. I did it! Betas! Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap! What-what are we working with here? What's goin' on? Are these cougars? Cougar, Oof. Cougar. Kind of a cougar-poodle mix. Uh-huh. Cougar-doodle. Aw. Ah! Oh, ho, ho, ho. Wow. Cougar-doodle opened the sample case. Yeah, they're very smart. Bobby! Why are you all wet? Wow, hi, guys. I brought the guys for burgers. I've kind of been forgetting to feed them. Sorry Dean Dixon banned you and Slowhand from campus. But thank you. 'Cause, you know, you de-Yapified us. With that guy banned from the frat, my GPA might go up. Yeah, sorry Yap called you a nerd for doing homework. And that I said I agreed with him. What is what is happening right now? What is this? Go for it, man. I don't know what to do from here. Beta rules! Uh, uh, uh, uh. How do you like that? Why are none of these guys interested? Tonight everybody gets hazed! My sisters are my brothers! I'm gonna go pee out a window! Wait, why is everybody holding vibrators?  He is freaky, freaky, freaky  Sneaky Pete  He's unique-y, nique-y, nique-y   Sneaky Pete  Make you shrieky, shrieky, shrieky   Sneaky Pete  Ah-ah, Sneaky  Sneaky Pete  He is freaky, freaky, freaky   Sneaky Pete  He's unique-y, nique-y, nique-y   Sneaky Pete  Make you shrieky, shrieky, shrieky   Sneaky Pete. I want to go home with you with your bedside drawer and live there forever."
"Dad, why are you massaging the turkey now? Maybe it's tense. I'll make it some tea. I'm doing a three-day salt rub. I call it Father of the Brine. Huh? Ha! Thank you. It's special since we're having Teddy, Mort and your Aunt Gayle over. I don't see why Gayle and her cats have to stay with us all week. She had to vacate her place because of the fire, Bob. She put her dental dams in the dryer. What are dental dams? Nothing. Forget it. Don't say it at school. Didn't she used to only have one cat? Ah, she adopted one last week. And then she found one on her way over here. She's a cat magnet. Oh, it was so sad. He was just sitting on someone's porch, poor little guy. Just sittin' there. Just sitting there in the sun. Aah. Ugh. Ugh, cat hair. Take one of the allergy pills I got you! Well, Dad, I hope you're not allergic to melody and rhythm and sexy lyrics, 'cause our guests are gonna love my Thanksgiving song! Ugh. Every year, I try and tell you guys that no one really sings Thanksgiving songs. You bite your tongue! Think about it. Why aren't there any Thanksgiving carols? I'm gonna write a classic and make a million dollars! And then I'm gonna buy a car! I believe in you, Gene. I'll be in your  Song! Great, but you don't get any of the profits, and I'm going to be very critical. Ha! I love it! Welp, good luck with your song. And don't be offended if everyone's talking about how great my turkey is while you're trying to sing. Sounds like someone's afraid of being upstaged. You are. You are. Oh, God. Get out of here! Bob, stop hitting my cats! And God bless you. I'm not hitting them! I'm petting their rear legs. Mom? Whoa! I need your opinion on something. Ooh, I love it! Braveheart meets Coco Chanel! I need to decide which color I'm wearing when I sit at the adults' table on Thursday. No, no lipstick, Tina. You're-you're too young. And you're sitting at the kids table like you always do when we have guests. Yup, we sit on the floor at the coffee table and put our vegetables under the couch. You should look under there. It's fascinating now! But I bought pantyhose! And I've been working on Tina's talking points. How's this one? ""In this economy?"" Oh, provocative! That's it. I You know, I'm in charge of Thanksgiving. Gene, Linda, no song. What?! Tina, no adults table. Aw! Louise, whatever you're planning, do not do it. I need some peace and quiet. I want to focus on the turkey. Everyone, just go to bed. Bob, it's 6:30. I don't care! Just go to bed! You love that turkey more than you love us! That's right! I do! I love turkeys! Okay. Now go! What the? Oh, my God! No! Lin! Lin! What? What happened? What happened? Wha? The turkey it's in the toilet! What are you talkin' about? You had a bad dream. Go back to sleep. This is not a dream. This is happening. Tina! There was something in the toilet, and I sat on it. It was cold, and now I don't know if I'll ever be able to go to the bathroom again. Oh, my God, the turkey's in the toilet! Get off of there! What the cuss word?! Who pooped that, and may I apprentice with you? What is this, a pee-pee party? You people are fun, all going at once! - Oh, God. Oh. Aah! Aah! - Ugh! Ugh! Get it out of their litter box! Quick, Bob! They're vegetarians! Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf. I'm gonna b Oh, my God, what is happening?! Okay, so really? No one is going to confess? Louise? It wasn't me! Louise? It wasn't! Fine. So, no one, including Louise, wants to admit that they did this? I'm giving you guys one more chance to confess, and then I'm grounding everyone, including your mom and Gayle. Bobby! No, it's fine with me. I don't have any plans. Bobby, it wasn't us. It was Louise. Come on. Or, uh, maybe Gene. How dare you?! I put food in the toilet the way God intended. It had to be Louise. Unbelievable. Does everyone think I did it? Well, then, I must be guilty. That's how it works, right? Yup. Perfect system. Well, I have to go get another turkey. Which means I can only do a two-day brine, which is not as good as a three day-brine! But I'm not forgetting this. I will figure out who did it. Even though I'm pretty sure we all still think it was Louise. Make sure you save room at Thanksgiving for the words you'll be eating! Wait. Are you gonna throw that one out? Yes, Gene, it was soaking in toilet water. And rolled in cat feces. Oh, God, I'm gonna barf again. No, no, no. Lin, please! Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf! Ugh! Wait a second. You just got a turkey yesterday. Yup. Turkey number two, huh? Messed up the first one? No, it's a long story. Not so easy to just step into the kitchen, is it? No, actually, I'm a professional cook. Yeah. You and me both, right? Okay, don't mess this one up. I-I didn't Next! I-I didn't mess it up! Turkey in the toilet? That's crazy. It's not that crazy. I've seen crazier things in a toilet. You wouldn't believe what I've seen. I've seen a rat wearing a little hat. What? Twice. Same rat, different hat. I got a picture. Hold on. Wait. Is this the toilet turkey? No, I got a new one. What did you do with the old one? What do you mean, what did I do? I threw it out. You threw out a perfectly good turkey? It wasn't perfectly good, Teddy. It was in the toilet. Ugh. Why does everyone want to eat food from the toilet all of a sudden? Guys, I found the picture! Rat in a hat. Oh, my God. Hmm. Three days I waited on a stakeout for that rat to come back, and he looks at me and he looks at me like, ""What are you lookin' at?"" Come on, Mom, Gayle, focus! We've only got two days left to make a Thanksgiving song that will be passed down for generations. And a one, and a two. I don't know about these lyrics. What?! Gayle, you are a guest here. You will sing what you are given. No, Gene, Gayle's right. This song's kind of meh. It needs a little gravy. That's it! No one's done a song about gravy. Think about it. Hmm. Gravy. Rhymes with wavy, oopsie daisy, Patrick Swayze. All right, I'm in! Anyone mind if I turn on the news? Aah! I'm okay. You fell like a real lady. Thank you, young man. Hello, hi. Hi. Hi, Gayle. You look great. Louise, look at you. Did you do your hair? No. Love it. Gene. Hi. What a nice shirt you're wearing. Thank you. Excellent. I just want to say that I've calmed down from this morning, and in the spirit of the holidays, whoever did this, I am granting you a full pardon. Oh, I really thought that would work. Seriously, who put the turkey in the toilet?! Oh, Dad. If I may. I've taken the liberty of drawing up a little chart here. Let's review our suspects. Tina. She'd stop at nothing for some grownup stuffing. Did her table envy drive her over the edge? No. Gene. He thinks there's only room for one bird at this table. A song bird. Do-re-me?! Or was it Gayle? Dad went after her cats, she went after his turkey. Classic revenge tale. Classic. Or maybe, maybe Linda. Oh, sweet Linda. A long-suffering wife stuck in a bad marriage. Aw, poor thing! Lin! What? I got caught up in the story. She's good. And that leaves Louise, who had no motive at all. Thank you. The end. Thank you. What an imagination on this one, huh? Kids. Mmm. So, do you know who did it? Oh. No. Uh-uh. Then what's the point of all this? Hold on. I just had an idea. Was it you, Gayle?! Huh? Confess! Damn it, Gayle! Or you?! Confess! You're guilty as hell! Louise? What? Stop. Why? This isn't working. I guess I'll just never trust any of you again, forever, for as long as I live. Another great family meeting! Good night, everyone! Good night! Good night, Bob! Night, night! Good night, Dad! Do you want my charts to take into your room for review? No. Just go to bed then. No! Okay, fun's over! I want a name! Gene! Oh, come on! You know I don't go into the bathroom at night because of the shower ghost. Ah, that's him! It's got to be Tina! Tina wouldn't do something this immature. I accept your invitation to sit at the adults' table. No, Tina. Maybe it was me! Was it? No. I just started to feel left out. I don't know, Gayle. You are really weird. That's true. Come on, it wasn't Gayle. Is that a confession, Mom? What? That's crazy. Well, you aren't always the most trustworthy person, Linda. What!? Me!? Yes, you. That time you changed the channel when I was out of the room. What are you talking about? Oh, don't play innocent! It was Quantum Leap, and I'll never know where he leapt! You know where he leapt. Flush! Gene, stop! We need to get rid of the body! What if someone sees? Stop. Oh. Hi, uh, I need two turkeys, please. Oh. You again. Uh yeah. Look, I think I know what's going on here and, uh I'm flattered, but I'm in a relationship. What? Oh, no, no. I'm not trying to Hey, hey. Listen, Daddy, don't you let one rejection keep you from getting out there. You seem great. Okay, thanks. There's a whole group of guys out there who don't care about what guys look like. Uh could I just get my turkey, please? You know, I got a friend he's into Sloppy Bears. Wha-What's a Sloppy Bear? You know, you got the muffin top, you got food on your shirt. God, I I do. Let me set you up. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna write down their number on the receipt. You take it, and you do what you want. No, no, no, I think you have the wrong idea. I'm not interested in a gay yeah. Uh-huh, I know, you're not interested. In a relationship. That's cool. Here's the number. I'll talk to you later. Get out of here! Bob! Who is it? It's me. Open up. Uh-uh. Come on! No! Come on! No. I need to get into the bedroom. My armpits need a second coat of deodorant. I need to re-odorize. I stink! Ugh. I don't know. Bobby, you're being crazy. Uh fine, but close your eyes. Bobby, what are you doing? Hey, I said, eyes closed. You know my eyes don't completely close. I'm sorry, but I can't trust anyone. Oh, Bob, what's with the two turkeys? Nothing! Hey! You calm down! Now, come on, stop it. Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't tell anyone. Oh, I won't! Who would I tell? Come on, it's me! Okay, one's a decoy turkey for the upstairs fridge. The real turkey will be downstairs in the walk-in. Ha, ha! Bobby It's a good plan, right? Yeah. Yeah, I thought of it. You, my smart guy. Sometimes. Devious little turkey roaster in the bedroom. Well, well, maybe a little bit. You want to mess around? What? I don't know, all these turkeys it makes me horny. Well, not, not right now, Lin, no. You sure? Okay, maybe a little. That's my boy. Ooh, ooh, I really do need deodorant. Yeah, you really do. Whew, I stink. Wow. Put your face in it. No, I don't want Come on, put your face in it, put your face in it. I don't no, I don't want to go there. Put your face in it. It's coming at you. All right, get out. Oh, no, Dad. No, no, no, no, no, I fell asleep. Sorry for your loss. No, Tina, I'm sorry for whoever thought they could ruin Thanksgiving. Follow me to the walk-in. What?! No! A turkey in every toilet. Only in America, huh, guys? It was you, Lin, it's been you all along. Say it. No, Bobby, no, it wasn't me. You were the only one who knew about the second turkey. It had to be you. I knew about the second turkey. What? Lin! You know I tell Gayle everything, Bobby. She's my sister. It's true, I know everything, like that time you peed in the theater during Jerry Maguire. I didn't want to miss any of it! Mom told me, too. About peeing during Jerry Maguire or the turkey? Both. Mom and I shop together. We don't have any secrets. So all three of you knew? Louise and I knew, too. Mom's like a vault that's constantly open and constantly talking. Hey, I told you guys not to tell anyone I told you. Okay, Thanksgiving is officially canceled. For everyone or just for our family? Bob No, Lin, I've had it. Thanksgiving's ruined. There's no time to do the Father of the Brine on a new turkey, plus I'm way over the Thanksgiving budget. This is the worst Thanksgiving ever. Okay, calm down. No, I will not calm down! Hey, let's all forget about Thanksgiving and move on to Christmas. I'll go get the decorations. No, you know what? I take it back. I'm not canceling Thanksgiving. Yay. Whoever's doing this, I'm not going to let you win! Thanksgiving is back on! There will be a turkey, a stupid saltless turkey. You can put a turkey in a toilet, but you can't put me in a toilet! It kind of sounds like you want us to try to put you in a toilet. No, Louise, I don't want to be put in a toilet. Okay, but it sounded like that. It did sound like that, Bob. Let's try one, two, three. Hey, you again, huh? Oh, hey, you again and me, yep. I-I just, uh, I came for a, uh I suppose you want another ""turkey."" Yes, that's exactly what I want a turkey. I didn't come for anything el Okay, fine, you wore me down. Damn it. Uh Things are not going great with Tony. Haven't been great with Tony for a long time, you know? Tony's hot, but maybe it's time for me to just settle. Look uh, no, no, no. Look at me, I'm nothing. You, you love Tony, stay with Tony. I'm so sick of Tony and his dancing. Oh, no, I d I don't know Tony, but I-I assume it's great. It's not great with Tony. You should definitely stay with Tony. No, no, no. Yo, I'm taking my break! Oh, my God, we're doing this. No, we're not. Hey, what do you want to do? I don't nothing. You want to go to the beach, huh? No, maybe wait, I'm straight. I mean, I'm mostly straight. Let's grab a coffee. You should call Tony. No, let's just have sex! Ah, God, this feels so great! I should just sorry, I got to go cook this. Also I'm married, but if I wasn't Who am I kidding? You're out of my league. It would never work. What are you talking about? I really got to go. I'm gonna see you tomorrow. Probably not. I'll call you. It's almost too obvious. The table looks beautiful, Linda. Whoa, candles shaped like little pilgrims. Those can't be cheap. Yes, Linda, what a lovely spread. Oh, interesting, Teddy, looks like you're over here. Okay, where am I? Tina, Teddy isn't sitting at the kids' table, honey, no. It's okay, Lin, it'll be like I'm eating at a Japanese restaurant. I'll take my shoes off. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! Ha, I did it, I did it! What, Bob, what did you do? I cooked a turkey! Oh, wow. This guy's always fishing for compliments. Turkey's done. Okay, everyone sit Tina, not you. You thought you could stop me, but you can't. Oh, hello, everybody. One of you must be very unhappy to see this. Bob, you look terrible. Yeah, because I was up all night trying to stop a turkey murderer. Okay, before I serve the turkey Wait, Tina, what are you doing? I'm standing at the adults' table? Tina, go sit down at the kids' table. Fine, I'll go check in on the little ones. I'm great with them. So, as I was saying, to the terrorist who tried to stop me from serving this, I want it on the record that turkey was served on this day! But, but, before we do that, I need to serve some justice because I know who put the turkey in the toilet.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun! Oh, my God, she's got it, she's got it. Peas and carrots At first I wondered, who could be mad enough at Dad to do such a thing? I mean, sure, no one likes him. Louise. And he smells. But then I realized that I was looking at the wrong motive. The person who put the turkeys in the toilet was actually angry at me! Oh, my God. What are we doing? You see, this person knew that I would be blamed and potentially punished for this heinous crime. So, was it Mom? Don't think so. Correct, it was not. Was it Gayle? I don't know. No, it wasn't. Oh. Which brings us to Gene and Tina. At first I actually believed that Gene was too scared of the shower ghost to go into the bathroom at night, and I believed Dad's theory that Tina was too mature to do something like this. If she was acting alone. But what if they were working together?! I knew it. I can see it. That one's got crazy eyes. Gene taking the turkey out of the refrigerator each night and passing it to Tina, who dropped it in. Yes! They worked together to frame me because I have been slowly stealing their allowances over the last five years. Wait, you have? You have? Yes wait, you guys didn't know that? No. No. Oh, never mind 'cause I haven't been. Oh, good. Okay, uh, and now, before we eat wait, no one eat we Teddy, drop it! We would like to present our Thanksgiving song. No, Lin, it's time to cut the tur Yay, all right. Get over here, Gene, hit it, come on. A one, two, three, four.  A ding, a ding  A-what's that sound?  It's the gravy boat  A-comin' around  It's not a navy boat  It's the gravy boat   Filled with bravery  Savory sailor folk  Sailors in your mouth  Sailors in your mouth. Bobby? Hey, Bobby. Bobby? Huh? Bob, come back. What are you? Dad? He's taking the turkey. Huh, is this part of the show? Are we supposed to grab something? No, no, no. I'm getting the potatoes. Wait for me, Bobby. No, n-n-n-no. Wait for me, Bobby. Aah! What the? Dad's a sleepwalker? Not normally. Should we wake him? Never wake a sleepwalker; They could get violent. And whatever you do, don't give him an ax. What, an ax? Why would we give him an ax? Don't! Let's give him an ax! Okay, Tina, do you have to go pee-pee or poo-poo? Oh, my God, he thinks the turkey's Tina. Why does Dad think I'm a turkey? Your cocky strut. I don't know, unless He must be remembering toilet-training you. Potty. Yeah, there it is Tina's poo-poo potty. All right, who's a big girl? He potty-trained all you kids. I couldn't stomach it. The stinky babies. Just the thought of it. My dad toilet-trained me. It was the worst seven years of my life seven to 14. I like to think I trained the toilet. It didn't teach me anything. Oh, stinky. Oh, it's kind of sweet. Oh, my God, there goes the stuffing. Oh, God, oh, God. Wow, Tina, you really had to go. Aah, we're losing stuffing! Oh, it's nice. You have to stop him before he drops the turkey in. Okay. Aah! No, don't wake him. Aah! Ow, what-what's going on? No! Hold his arms and legs so he can't attack. Give me some help here! Ah, Dad, if you're still asleep, can I borrow a hundred bucks? Can I get a neck tattoo? Let go of me! It's for your own good! Aah! What's happening? Who's fighting me? It's your friend! No, no, no, no, no, bad kitties. It's the end of the world! Go on, get, get, go! It's for your own good, Bobby! Aah, let go! Finally something to be thankful for! It was the allergy pills. Says right here. ""Side effects include sleepwalking, sleep talking, ""night terrors, and dry mouth. ""Contact your doctor if you lose vision or if your heart stops beating."" Huh. That doesn't explain why Dad kept dreaming about toilet-training me. Yeah, the same dream over and over. It's got to mean something, like the time I dreamt about a dolphin and I woke up and my bed was on fire. What did that dream mean? Just that I didn't have balance in my life I was spending too much time at work. Also, I shouldn't leave matches right by my bed. I had just gone to the aquarium; It probably had something to do with that. Oh, my God, Bobby, don't you see? You were worried about Tina growing up 'cause she wanted to sit at the adults' table. You see how it works? Ooh, Dad loves Tina. I knew it. It's okay, Dad, even if I sit at the adults' table, I'll still be your little girl. Just because I've got the hang of pooping and peeing in the potty doesn't mean I don't need your help with other things, like homework or faxing. I don't know how to fax. Mom, can you help me fax something right now? It's okay, Tina, I know you've got to grow up sometime. Just maybe no lipstick yet. Okay. And no panty hose. I don't think anyone still wears those, right? Not in this economy. Tina. Aw, I love my little family. Come here, family hug, come here, aw. You, too, Gayle. That's nice. Come on, come on, yeah, here we go. Hey, Teddy, Mort, come on, what are you doing? Come over here. I can see from here. What the hell? Ow, Teddy, why are you hugging so hard? Because I'm full of love, Bob. Hug. Okay, Gene, time to go poo-poo.  A ding, a ding  A-what's that sound?  It's the gravy boat  A-comin' around  It's not a navy boat  It's the gravy boat  Filled with bravery  Savory sailor folk  Stuffing sailors disembark   Fill our plates and fill our hearts   Sailors in your mouth, sailors in your mouth   That's what Thanksgiving is all about."
"Yeah!  Yeah! We're Bad Hair Day! Thank you! Wow! Okay. I think we know the winner of this talent show. But we have one more band. Uh ""The Ta-Ta's""? Give it up. Um, hello. Hello?  We're the Ta-Ta's  And we're gonna rock ya  We like to cha-cha and eat frittatas  Bring back Bad Hair Day! Oh, my face! Yeah. Uh-huh. Wait. You want us to do what?! No, no, no. No way. Debbie, no! De I said no, Debbie! Good-bye! What is Debbie's problem?! And who is Debbie? She's organizing my 25-year high school reunion. Why does that make you so angry? Dish, girl. Because she wants my high school band to play there, and I don't want to be humiliated all over again! Right. Your reunion. So, are we going? Are we not going? I mean, I'll do whatever. Eh, I don't think I want to go now. Oh, thank God! I'm confused. Why wouldn't they get the other band? You know, the one that totally dominated you guys at the talent show? What were they called? Bad Hair Day? Aah! Don't you speak those words in this house! Bad hair day. Doo! Bad hair day. Gah! Bad hair day. Dat! If you must know, Louise, we were not Debbie's first choice or second or third. I think her exact words were, ""I am desperate and out of ideas."" Eh, I wouldn't read too much into that. Mom, time-out. This is your big chance. Don't hide your Ta-Ta's under a bush. You've got to get the band back together and play at the reunion. Tina, shush! Sorry, but reunions are horrible. High school is horrible. I mean, it'll be fine for you. Oh, good. Guess Dad doesn't want to go. Look, it was fun when we were just making up songs in Angie Moscatone's garage, but then it was horribly ruined forever. Like three out of five of my sexy parts after I had kids. Destroyed. Bad Hair Day. Whoa! Go wash the bathroom floor! What? No! I don't Go wash it! We never wash floors! You scrub it! Play at the reunion. Who wants to be in a band anyway? Like I need to be laughed off the stage again.  No, thank you  No, thank you! God, I sound good! Nobody sounds good in the shower!  I'm a Ta-Ta and I'm gonna rock ya   I'm singing from the heart  I still got two out of five, I still got two out of five   I still got two out of five sexy parts! Whoo!  Can you believe we laughed at her at the talent show? We must be idiots. They were all idiots! I'll show 'em! Bob, I changed my mind. - I want to go to the reunion now. - Yeah! Yeah! Crap! Way to go, Mom! Celebration flush! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Buckle up, kids. Time to get the band back together.  We got Angie on the drums  Yeah, yeah, yeah!   We got Patsy on the bass  Yeah, yeah, yeah!   Nancy on guitar  Yeah, yeah, yeah!   And the last one is your Aunt Gayle   And I know she's gonna say yes   'Cause she always loved this band, and she's my sister!  No. Oh, come on! Why not? Because you never let me sing any of my songs! That's because your songs were all so, uh Sexual. Pardon? And you had a serious speech impediment. I know. I wrote a song about it called ""Ge-Ge-Ge-Ge, Ge-Ge-Ge-Ge, Ge-Ge-Ge-Ge, Genitals."" Derek Dematopolis will be there. Oh. Derek Dematopolis. Oh, oh. Who's Derek Dematopolis? Gayle had a crush on him all through high school. He was a Greek god. At least he wasn't a Roman god. Those guys are jerks. Okay, I'll do it if I get to sing one of my songs. Ooh ooh ooh Okay, fine! Yay! The Ta-Ta's are back together! Wait. Why are you looking at me like that? What's wrong? Is this a bad idea? No. He likes it. I I don't know. He's smiling. - He looks worried. - He's on board. You, look at me now! We have come too far for you to ruin this. Oh, no. You know what? He just has to poop. I'll do it. Yay, Ta-Ta's! Oh, God. He's going. Everybody stay calm. And one, a two, a three, a four.  And I just want to know Uh, Linda? When are we going to practice my song? Gayle, I'm singing here! Hello! Yeah, okay, well, maybe I'll sing my song quietly underneath. Ugh. Wow, a real band rehearsal. You guys, we can be groupies! Gene, who's your favorite? Nancy, 'cause she brought guacamole. Mine is Mom, and not 'cause I'm biased. It's just I like her energy. How about you, Louise? Gosh, it's hard to choose. They're all so cool. Uh, Lin? What?! Sorry, it's just, people are complaining. Too bad! You know, they want to know if you guys can maybe try tuning up again. Or No! just play on the beat and just do it right? No! All right. Okay, we're losing customers. Good-bye. And a one, two, three, four, go! Do what? Let's rock! I need my sticks. Are we starting? Uh, Linda? Linda? What, Gayle? When are we doing my song? I found my drum sticks. Good. Listen, ladies, we got to blow the roof off of that reunion! So let's stop fooling around and turn this band into a lean, mean, mom-jeans revenge machine! Yeah! Mom jeans! Wait. Mom, now your energy is sounding a little negative. Tina, shush! And a one two, three, four! Yeah! That's it! Yeah! Oh, boy. Bob! Come on, we're gonna be late for sound check! Just a minute! What are you wearing? What? It's my rock-and-roll clothes. Are you a rock-and-roll hobo? Ugh, I can't believe we don't get to see this freak show with our own eyes! Yeah, sorry. This is a grown-ups thing. It's rated R for ""really boozy"" starring me. Good one, Mom. Hey, I've got something that'll turn those upside-down smiles back the right way. Me as your babysitter. Yay! Um Tina, about that Yeah? Hello. Mother, what is she doing here? Uh, Honey, you're a great babysitter for, like, uh, short bursts. You're like a cheetah. Okay, a cheetah. So far, so good. But, uh but we're gonna be gone a long time tonight, so we need a long-haul sitter. The-the boring, old, long-haul sitter. Sorry, Jen. What? Is this 'cause last time I let Gene eat all the Chunky Chocolate Shim Shams and he threw up in your bed? Yes. And I'd do it again! I know! What's going on in there? I can't go. Why? I have a problem. I told you, wipe front to back! No, it's this. Get it out. Get it out. Oh, my God. Dad's nose got a nipple! It's a pimple, and it's hideous. Look at it! It's staring right at me! Look, when I walk to the side of the room, it follows me! Are you guys done? No! Okay, you've had your fun, all of you. It's not fun. It's humiliating. I hate high school! Were you messing with it? No. Oh! Oh, God! Ow! Ow! Ow! Maybe a little. God, can a pimple have two heads? I can't go. I can't go outside like this! Try putting masking tape on it. Some silly putty. I did that. Quit stealing my thunder, Bobby. This night isn't about your disgusting zit. It's about me and my big comeback and this jacket. I just want that thing out of my house! Fine, I'll go, but we're stopping to buy more concealer on the way. You're all out. I used a lot. If they ask, Dad, you're an autumn. All right, I'm gonna hit the head. See you in a bit! Linda, you're here. Hello, Debbie. Well, I tried to be a good organizer, I did, but I-I yeah, I couldn't get Bad Hair Day. Da-da-da. You're not gonna regret this, Debbie! No. I mean, I think I will, but  'Cause we're here to rock!  I'm gonna be like Carrie up on the stage!  But hopefully less blood. Um, did you say ""Carrie""? Yep.  Bye, Debbie.  I'll see you inside!  ""Pat lightly with finger to blend."" Whoa! Hello, handsome. I spy with my little eye something brown. Is it a babysitter who stabbed a fellow babysitter in the back? Huh? Huh? Is it? Uh, no. It's the couch. Oh. Yeah, that is brown. Um, uh, I'm gonna go check the pantry, not look for Shim Shams. Bye. Come on! We should be at the reunion! Watching the train wreck of all train wrecks! Come on, Jen, buddy, you got a car, right? You got a license. You like adventure, huh? You want to please us, right, huh? What do you say we drop in? Just one quick drink, we're out of there. Oh, Jen, think how many things you could spy at that reunion. Green things, purple things, bright things, dark things! Come on, Jen! I spy reunions! Um, I'm really trying to honor your mom's instructions. ""I'm really trying to honor your mom's instructions."" I'm mocking you. Listen, whatever she's paying you, I'll double it, then divide it by ten. No, no, 20. No. Where are the Shim Shams, Jen?! I know you're hiding them! Tell me! Whoa. Sorry, I'm extremely ticklish. I'll say. Interesting. Hi. Derek Dematopolis. Oh. Hi. Uh, Bob Belcher, Linda's husband. Your, uh, nose is about to fall into your drink there. What? Is that makeup? No. Uh yeah, it is. Thanks. Sorry about that. It's, uh, makeup. Wow, you've got quite a pimple there. Yeah, it's pretty bad. Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? It's okay. I'm a dermatologist. Derek Dematopolis, the dermatologist? Yup. Wow. That is, uh What? That is really Well, it's throbbing. Yeah, it's been really bad for Yeah. Does it hurt when I do this? Ow! Yeah, it does. That hurts a lot. Did it hurt? Yeah. You know, Stacy works at a spa. Hey, Stacy! Oh, no, no, I don't want to make a big thing Stacy! Ugh! Hello. Oh, my God, look at that. Yeah. Huh? Yeah. That's my pimple. Phew! Bet you'd love to get a whack at that thing. Ho, ho! You know who should see this, though, is Tonya. No. She might have some samples. No, come on. She's-she's in pharmaceuticals. Yeah. She's got the good stuff. Tonya? Yeah. Oh, my God. Get over here. Get a load of this! Tonya. Tonya! Did-did all of you get jobs in skin care?! No, I do hair plugs. Here's my card. Thank you. Okay, guys. This is how we're gonna get to the reunion. I don't know. She seems really ticklish. It's weird. At least she didn't fart. When I get tickled, I fart, but that's me. Tina, the girl took your job! Make her armpits regret it for the rest of their lives! Hey, Jen. Hi. Hey, Louise. Do you want to do something? I have pencils in my purse. Oh, wow. That's fun. You know, we do want to do something. Okay. We want you to drive us to the reunion, Jen. And if you don't, you're gonna get the human feather duster. That's me. Uh And you're also gonna tell us where the cookies are! And you're gonna let me eat them all and throw up wherever I want! Aah! You probably shouldn't tickle me. Oh, playing hardball, huh? Tina, give her a little taste. Oh, really, guys. Aah! Aah! Aah! Uh-oh. Hello, alumni of Cardinal Gennaro High. I hope everyone's having a good time, and if you're not, I'd like to see you organize something on this budget, in this time frame. It's been really hard. All right, we're about to go on, so, set list. We'll start with ""We're the Ta-Ta's"" and then we'll go right into ""You Were All Wrong About Us"" and then ""Oh, Boy, You All Got So Fat."" And then my song? Yeah, yeah, yeah, if we have time. Everybody ready? Feel pumped? Do you feel pumped? I feel bloated. Good use it. So, yeah, divorce is hard. But you know what? You get up in the morning and you what? Oh, my goodness. Recent developments to announce. We thought they couldn't come, but they're here our very own Bad Hair Day! What? Gah! We're back where we started. It's like the talent show all over again, huh? First place took home the gold. And then our next gold was a gold record!  Have a PhD in rock and roll  So, they're gonna go on first 'cause they've got a packed stadium show to get to, and then you can follow them. That sound good? First the famous girl band, then you guys. Great. BHD! BHD! Linda, come on, get into it. BHD, BH Ow, ow, ow.  My family is my guitar So, just hold this pad here? Oh, wait, let me take a ""before"" picture. I want to show someone at work. Oh, no, no, no Got it. Ah, okay. Oh, my God, what's that? I should go check on that thing I just saw. Hey, hey, where you going, where you going, where you going? Hey, hey, to Bob's pimple. To Bob's pimple! Hey, what are we toasting over here? Oh, my God.  'Cause we won the talent show  Hey, Linda, about my song Not now, Gayle. Do you know how to juggle fire? What if, while I'm singing, I throw you a torch? Oh, will you shut up about your stupid song? Your song's out. We're not doing it. What? You said I could sing it. Yeah, well, that was before B-Bad Hair Day showed up. Your song would just make it worse. My cat was right about you. This reunion's made you nuts. I quit. Oh, fine, quit. I'm gonna go fill my purse with food and then write some graffiti about you in the bathroom and then wait in the car for you to give me a ride home. This is bad. Babysitters aren't supposed to give kids black eyes unless Yeah, no, they're No, no, no, they're not. I'm going to get fired. What'll I do? You'll probably have to leave town, work on a shrimp boat, call yourself JJ. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No one has to know about this if you take us to the reunion. But won't your parents see the black eye? Hmm, all right, there's only one solution. We all have to have black eyes. Jen has a black eye. Tina has a black eye. Gene has a black eye. I have a black eye. Who did it? Nobody knows. ""How'd you get your black eye?"" ""I don't know."" ""How-How'd you get your black eye?"" ""What, do I have one?"" ""Yeah."" Oh, my God, what happened? I guess a black eye fairy came and kissed us all on the eye. Wait, what? But if Jen gets in trouble, I get to be babysitter again. I'm back, baby. No, no, no, Tina, Tina, we need leverage here. Damn this big heart of mine. I guess Jen shouldn't get fired. Well, then it's time for some punch! Thank you, little people! We're not gonna stay and mingle! Good night! Whoo! Good luck, Tay-tas. Ta-Ta's! Right, right, right. Give it up for Bad Hair Day. How can you top that? You can't. And next up, the Ta-Ta's. Linda, come on. Gah, dah, gah. Yeah, Ta-Ta's, whoo! Oh drunk. Linda. You should go out there. Linda. Get out there. Come on, Lin, rock and roll! Uh Uh, be right back. Linda, are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. All right, uh, DJ? Get out here, pizza face. Uh, no, thanks. Ah, get out here. No, I can't, I-I should check on my wife. Come on, it's your night. Ha-ha, it's not really. Ha, nah, I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the pimple. Okay. ""Okay, I'm coming."" Go, pimple, go, pimple, go, pimple. That stupid nothing Uh, Jen, we're gonna need to hang a little U-ey. Hello, Mother, we'd like to give you a ride, but you look crazy. What? Where are you going and, and what happened to you? We all got punched, no one knows how, life's funny that way. The end. I still don't get our plan. Shush, Tina. Gah! Anyway, Mom, where are you going? Yeah, what happened with the band? Oh, it was a disaster. Bad Dah Dah came and played and blew everyone away. We would have been laughed off the stage just like back then. So you left? Yeah. You're a runaway Ta-Ta? Yeah You look like you could use some Shim Sham crumbs. Here you go. Oh, oh, that's good, it makes it's good. Linda. Linda, listen. Huh? Linda, listen. Wha? Huh, what? Linda. What, Jen? Your band is probably bad, but I don't let it bother me that I'm not a good babysitter. I have no chemistry with children, I don't know how to use a ""mick-rowave,"" I don't know what ""bath time"" means, but I do it 'cause I love it. Maybe you should think about that. Ah Whoo-hoo-hoo! Derek, I'm reeling you in, buddy! It's a fish! Linda! What? Why are the kids here? Do they all have black eyes? It's babysitter stuff, Dad, get over it. Yeah, it's above your pay grade. Uh, okay, I want to come back to that 'cause none of what you just said makes sense, but first I want to talk to your mother. Lin, I know you're nervous about going up there. I-I was nervous about my pimple, but I was brave and I came here anyway, and I'm having the time of my life, so Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I already got the inspirational speech from Jen. Okay? That's all right, I'm fine. Oh, all right, well, I'm gonna go back with my friends, then. Hello, hey, everybody, uh, sorry for the delay. So we're gonna play for you, and, uh, not all those songs I wrote about how fat your butts got because this shouldn't be about revenge. It should be about having fun. Sure, we might suck. We might be total crap, right, girls? Uh But that's okay. We're doing it 'cause we love it. Whoo. And, uh, hey, uh shush, shush listen, I got something else to say. Back when this was just for fun, when it was just us girls, there was someone who I loved to sing with more than anyone else, and that's my sister Gayle. Hmm? I'm sorry. I'm sorry to all you guys. This Ta-Ta has been a real boob. So, uh, our first song is by Gayle. Let's hear it for her Gayle! Really? Yes.

I know, best pimple ever. Okay, if you think that thing is coming home with us, you're crazy. I hope it never leaves! No, I have to pop it for my sanity. Sit back down. Don't get off me. Hold his face. I'm gonna give it a black eye! Gene, get your hands off me. I'm gonna go left and put pressure on the left side! Don't touch it! Tina, pressure on the right side. Get your hands off me! Hold his face, hold it tight! Ooh, it's so weird! One, two, three! Why am I all wet? - Oh, my God. - Why am I all wet? I'm sorry, Dad. Lin, pull over, pull over. Ah, quit being such a baby, Bob, and wipe the windshield it's gross. I wonder what happened to Gayle. I guess she got a ride. Ow, ow, ow, you're pulling on my neck hair. It's mine now.  This is down here but it should be up there   This is kinda loose and I think it might tear   This is lumpy  And it's dumpy   This is saggy  And it's flabby   When I bend down, I pee a little bit   But it's not bad  Not bad for havin' three kids  Or three cats. These are the ones from the song. The song's about them my kids.  Not bad for havin' three kids   Drum, pop, drum, pop  Not bad for havin' three kids."
"Ugh, even stripes don't help. His body's an enigma. Do they make an apron with a control top? I think you look pretty, Dad. Stop it. I just want a plain white one. You can't wear white. You're not a virgin. Gene. Hey, there's Mr. Frond. Oh, hello, Belcher family. Classy martini set. The name's Frond. James Frond. I've got a license to counsel. Double-oh-so-sad. Louise, be nice. Why? It's Mr. Frond. Ah, Tina, since I caught you, your Home Ec teacher Mrs. Woods is going on disability. O-M-G. Is she okay? Obviously, I can't share confidential details. All I can say is, she's a drug addict. So, until she comes back, we're folding Home Ec in with Metal Shop. Metal Shop? Say good-bye to your fingers. You can build metal fingers. Boy, it's a shame to cancel Home Ec. I mean, everybody needs to learn how to cook, right? A lot of kids aren't lucky enough to grow up in a restaurant. Oh! So that's what you tell yourself. Well, Bob, maybe you'd like to fill in as a substitute, huh? Me, teach? Wow, I mean, I can't. I-I've got the restaurant to run. But it is an honor to pass on what you know to the next generation, right? I mean, I might even change some lives. What's wrong with Dad? Frond is right! I can teach kids! Mmm I did it with you, Gene. What the hell, let's do it. Wow, this will be great. I've never been teacher's pet before. But now I have a huge head start because Dad already likes me. Like is a strong word. Teacher's pet, the gold star of gold stars. Mmm Ahh What are you doing, Tina? Nothing. You'll see. Well, here I am, all set for my first day. Oh, my God. You look so handsome! Just like Richard Dreyfuss in Mr. Holland's Old Penis. Um Why are you carrying Mom's old purse? Oh. I-I thought it kind of looked like a briefcase. Go ahead and use it. But let me take out my pepper spray. Unless you want to cook with it. If it's anything like butter spray, I'm in! Guys, remember, at school, I'm Mr. Belcher, so treat me like you would any other substitute teacher. That means you get a mean nickname and we assume you live a horribly depressing life. In this case, we know it's true. Bob, you're getting a nickname! Fun! Mr. Belt-Stretcher. Ha! Mr. Bowel-Chair. No, Dr. Fart! Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III. Those are kind of all not very good. Hmm, Bowel-Chair, pretty good. All right, let's go to school. Let me try a squirt of that pepper spray. Oh, actually, not so bad. Aw, what's the matter, Teddy? You're actually chewing your food instead of throwing your head back like a duck. I got to go to my cousin's wedding this weekend and I'm dreading it. Oh. Is this the cousin you got to second base with? No, that was my second cousin and it was third base. What is it then? There's always dancing at weddings, and I can't dance. You know, Teddy, I could teach you how to dance. I taught myself, and look at me. That is impressive. Right? I don't know. I mean, the wedding's in three days. That's plenty of time. It's maybe's too much time. Can they move it up? I don't think so. They already rented a bounce house. Bounce house? Yeah, pretty shi-shi. Hello, class. I'm, uh, Mr. Belcher, your substitute. I will be teaching you, but I also look forward to each one of you whoa teaching me. Nice purse, Mr. B.! It's a it's a briefcase. Man purse! No, it's not a man purse. Purse! Anyway, what have you guys covered so far? Pies? Omelets? Maybe you've tackled a casserole? One time we made popsicles out of juice. And then we made juice by melting popsicles. Oh, wait, that was in science. We don't cook in Home Ec. We watch educational movies. And I do funny commentary. Zeke's really funny. 'Prec. So put in a flick Mr. B. No, no, no. Today, why don't we actually do a little cooking? Cooking's stupid! The only cooking I do is an Indian burn! Ah! Zeke, it burns! Gotcha! I'm gonna go get your neck! Zeke! Zeke, let him go. Play the movie! Movie! Movie! Movie! Movie! Movie! Movie! Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III! Dr. Fart! Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III! I have pepper spray in my purse, and I will use it! Movies! Movies! Movies! Movies! You're animals! You're all animals! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on in here? Calm down, children. Here's your movie.  I'm here to teach you Home Ec   It'll only take a sec Nothing to make fun of yet. I'm really enjoying it so far. Kids are horrible. Why do we keep making them? Do you need a hug? No. Kind of. No. All ght, Bob, I should have explained. Home Ec isn't for honor students. It's where dumb-dumbs learn to make ice. You know my daughter's in that class, right? Yes, Bob, I do. Okay, but shouldn't we be challenging these kids? What? Like a fight? I don't want to fight those kids. Maybe the girls, but No, teaching them. Teaching them how to cook. Bob, the movies mellow them out. It's not like we can slip meds into their milk. Anymore. What? Hmm? I got to go. I g-got lots to do. Wait. Di But I'm not go - I don't want to go back in there. - Frond So, what's the easiest step? No steps. If I wanted to see steps, I'd go to a staircase. Right. Everyone's a dancer. You're probably dancing all day long, you don't even know it. There! You just tugged up your pants to cover up your butt crack. Now, that could be a move. Okay, tug and wiggle, tug and wiggle. Right? Tug and wiggle, tug and wiggle. Now let's make your boom-boom jiggle. Come on. There he is. Look at you. Bill Cosby's got nothing on me. Hey, guys. Hey, how was Home Ec? - Keep it goin', Teddy. - It was fun. Mr. Belcher totally lost control of the class. Dad did great. He broke down and cried quicker than any substitute teacher ever. I didn't cry. Well, the rumor that I started says otherwise. I started a rumor you wear diapers. But so far, no traction. No, I heard that. Yes! Nah, just quit, Bob. You always have a job at Bob's Burgers. Yeah, that'll cheer him up. No. You know what. I'm not gonna quit on those kids. I just have to find a way to reach them. Should I still be dancing? I'm having chest pains. Keep goin'! Sorry I was all up in your grill about cooking yesterday. Don't try to be our friend. Um, all right, well, let's fire up Chester the Home Ec-ster Meets Dustin the Dusting Cowboy. Those two are always gettin' into it. Oh, anybody want some microwave popcorn to go with the movie? Whoops, I ripped the bag. Now we can't have popcorn! Idiot. Hey, everybody, maybe there's another way to make popcorn. He's trying to microwave without a microwave. Mr. B.'s lost it. God, he's lost it! Let's see where he goes with this. Oh, my God! What's happening?! We're cooking, Jocelyn. That's what's happening. What's cooking? Aw, poop, he tricked us! Or, aw, poop, he taught us. It smells like real microwave popcorn. Hey, who wants to make some kettle corn? Me! Me! I do. You rock, Mr. Belcher. All right, Anthony. Down low, too slow. Oh. You got there in time. Come on. There's a line? That was a great class, Mr. Belcher. Calm down, kiddo. Sorry, Zeke, I just got carried away. Nah, we're cool and all but just shut up sometimes. Right. Got it. Shut it! Jimmy Jr., shut it! Your dad's really cool. He's married! To a friend of mine! What the heck happened here? I'm not sure. I think Dad might be a great teacher. Your dad rules! Hey, I don't appreciate your lack of sarcasm. There's a lot of competition for teacher's pet. It's a real petting zoo in there. And shake it and shake it and shake it and shake it and Aw, stop shakin' it. Whew. Teddy, I'm gonna be frank, okay? You got the moves but there's no fire. I got no fire! No, it's okay because weddings have firewater. Firewater? Yes. What is firewater? It's alcohol. Right. Okay. It's been helpin' men dance at weddings since the beginning of time. Come on. You chug-a-lug and cut a rug! Well, I got to fix a roof later but this is important. Attaboy! Will not be the first time I've fallen off a roof. Hi, I was wondering if I could borrow an egg? I'm Bob, the substitute Home Ec teacher. Well, well, well, Mr. Bob the substitute Home Ec teacher comes into my kitchen and wants to borrow a egg. If you don't have one, it's fine. No, let's get you that egg. Oh, thank you. Here it is. That's not an egg. That's your middle finger. If you don't want it sunny-side up, I can make it over easy. Finger upside down, got it. Want to see scrambled? Jeez, it's a little aggressive down here. I mean, aren't we on the same team? We both work for the school. I don't. I work for Caf-Co Food Services.

I was just run off the road by a truck shaped like a giant candy cane. Do you want to maybe write that down or call it in? Hello? Are you injured in any way? Um no. Was there any damage to your vehicle? No. So, what, was he mean to you? A truck driver was mean to you? Oh, snap! Louise, stop. Why do they call you ""the fuzz""? Is it because of your head? Gene.

Listen, there's a very dangerous man out there driving around in a huge candy cane. I'm gonna need you to slide back down into your booth. Officer, you just gotta listen to me! Sorry about that. Did you just hit that waitress? No. Yes, you did. I mean, yes, I did, but it was a mistake. Why would you hit someone on Christmas? It's 'cause this guy wasn't listening to me. Well, maybe if you slap more waitresses, I'll get right on it. Fine. Linda, kids. We're leaving. No more Dutch Babies! No! I think that's a good idea. Let's go. My Baby hasn't been delivered yet. Lin, come on! Oh, look, it came out in 22 minutes! Oh, it's a preemie just like Jesus. Hello? Anybody home? I know there's not, but I have manners. Mmm. That ham smells good. Wish my place smelled this hammy. Bob's really got it all. Oh, it's just a dial. Why did Bob make it so complicated? Hey, there's my Christmas card. Bob didn't open it. What's he waiting for, actual Christmas? Hello, cookies. I'll accept a tip. Tree or a reindeer? Ah, they probably taste the same. Or maybe they don't. Maybe I find out. Who knows? I need some milk. Mmm. ""The milk is in the fridge."" Okay. ""To reach milk, place your hand through Christmas wrist wreath."" That sounds fun. Oh! Oh! What's going on?! Aah! Oh! Oh, man! Ooh, pickles. Ah, hope you're happy, Bobby. You almost got this family arrested. You know, the only reason we're even driving around on Christmas Eve, Lin, is because you bought a tree on November 1! Your negative attitude is what probably killed our tree. Both of you, shush! We got to get home! Santa's not gonna kidnap himself. It's the one thing he can't do. Oh, my God. Is that him? It's the candy cane truck! Oh, here we go. Bob and his truck, everybody. Why is he in the middle of the road? Why is he coming so fast? Bobby! Bobby! Oh, my God! Bob, that candy cane truck is trying to kill us! That's what I've been saying! We don't listen to you! Oh, my Dutch Baby! Get it out from under the pedals, Lin! You're mushing it, Bobby! You're killing her! So you believe me now? Oh, I'm so sorry I doubted you, Bobby. I thought it was like that time you said you flushed but I know you didn't. I flushed. I saw what I saw! I still see it when I close my eyes. Look, we don't have time for this. We have to call the police. Gene, give your mom the phone! I can't. I'm on hold with the radio station! You've been on hold with them this whole time? ""Jingle in the Jungle"" is an American classic. You'll thank me when you hear it. Give her the phone! The battery's dead! Damn it, Gene! All batteries die, but this one truly lived. Hang on, everybody! Whoa! What are you doing?! I thought the car would spin all the way around like in the movies! Oh, we can't shake this guy! I'm gonna go down that little road. Bobby, do something. He's coming back! This guy's crazy! I'll pull the car in there and shut off the lights. Maybe he won't see us in the trees. Everybody stay still and be very quiet. Can I just say one thing? No, Gene. I think I have the best legs in the family. And the smoothest bottom. Okay, no more talking. Mom? Dad? Oh, my God. I just wanted to let you know. I was the one who didn't flush. It's okay, sweetheart. That was impressive though. It looked just like your father's. That's what I was going for. Can everybody just please stop talking? Now I know what the Von Trapps felt like. Dad? What? Where do babies come from? You all come from my vagina. I knew it. You owe me ten dollars, Tina. Everybody stop. He's right there. He's right there. - Can he see us? - I don't know. I think he's leaving. He's gone. Yay! All right. Yes! Nobody is saying it so I'll just say it. I saved all of our lives. Merry Christmas. Come on, let's go home! We're gonna time to do the tree. Oh, no. No! No! No! What? What happened? What happened? No, no, no, no, no! We're stuck. Nobody's saying it so I'll just say it. Dad ruined Christmas. It's like a disco. It's working! Oh, God! Aah! Come on, come on, we can do it. We couldn't do it. I told you we should drive a motorcycle with four side cars. Then we would never be in this mess! What are we gonna do, Bobby? We got to get out of here. I nominate Tina to walk for help. Just to be nominated is an honor. Don't worry. We'll figure something out. We're not missing Christmas. I promise. Hey look at that, it's just past midnight. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas, Radio DJ. Hey, no one's called in for this one tonight, but I'm playing it anyway. Here's ""Jingle in the Jungle."" Yay! Christmas miracle! I wasn't expecting so much bongo. I like it. You know what? Who needs a nice cozy, warm, comfortable home? We can have our own Christmas right here in the car. Yeah, until it runs out of gas and we freeze to death. Yeah. It's like we're a family of cops, staking out that bush. That's a dumb place to keep bowls. And all was right with the world, and Ah! Look what the wise men bought from the auto parts store. Let's all sing ""Silent Night.""  Silent  Night  Holy Crap! Truck! Bobby, we got to get out of here! It's still not working! Okay, everybody just stay calm. We're safe here in the car. I have a plan let's all get out of the car and run in different directions. He'll only catch the slowest one. Gene, you're the slowest one! Aah! I'm the slowest one! Kids, no, get back here! Maybe it's a different candy cane truck? Oh, my God. This is it. We're trapped. Kids, get in the car now. Lock the doors. Oh, thank God. Dad's on it. The handler's got it covered, guys! Relax! Bob, be careful. Tell him you had asthma when you were a boy. And you have bad night vision. Listen, uh, sir. Whatever it is you want, we're just trying to get home for Christmas. Can we just talk this out? Oh, you look like that. Um, okay. Uh, you seem like a small, reasonable guy. If this is about earlier, I'm sorry I cut you off. I don't want to point fingers, but it was my kids' fault. Yeah, Dad. Great. For Christmas I really wanted you to throw us under the bus. Let's do this! Me and you. It's go time! Aah! Just take my coat off. N-No. I'll fight him, punk! Come on, punk! Lin, stay in the car. Listen, this is crazy. I mean, why are you so angry? Just because I cut you off? You also kept honking at me. Repeatedly. It was ""Jingle Bells."" You don't know ""Jingle Bells""? Put 'em up, snowflake. Oh, we're gonna dance. Are you shivering? You should put your jacket back on. Oh, I-I I'm fine. Look, how about this? My car is stuck in the snow. If you can You're really shivering. If you could just help us pull it out 'cause you have a big truck I'm about to bang your ass and you're asking me for help? ""Bang my ass""? Yeah, bang your ass! Okay, I mean, you mean Okay. I-I've never heard it said that way. What? Bang? You mean, beat me up. You know, I think I meant kick. I'm pretty I think I meant kick. It was like halfway out of my mouth and I went, ""Ooh, that could be taken the wrong way."" Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Well, it All right, I-I Look. I'll tell you what, if you pull our car out of the snow, I-I'll-I'll let you punch me in the stomach. Bobby! Psst. You're gonna let this guy hit you? He's just a sad, little guy, Lin. I-I don't think it's gonna hurt. I'll just act like it does. Do your girl scream. What girl scream? I think she means your regular scream. And then do your girl walk. Girl walk? I don't have a girl walk. Yeah, you do this like I don't do that. Mmm, agree to disagree. Look, I think this guy's having a worse Christmas than us. He seems like he really needs this. Aw, that's the holiday spirit, Bobby. So cold. And crisp. I guess I'm near the crisper. I'm not gonna last much longer Maybe I can get to the knives on the counter. I could cut my way out. Teddy, you got to try. Just pretend you're moving a fridge for Bob. So, Bobby, you got a new fridge, huh? What else is new with you? Uh-oh. No, no, no, no, no, no Now I'm gonna die looking at Gene's finger painting. What is that even supposed to be? So, do we have a deal? I want to punch your stupid face! No, just the stomach. How about I kick you in the neck? Look, you get one punch to the stomach, and then you get us out of here. Fine, but I need to borrow your jacket. Look, let's just get this over with. Christmas is just a really hard time for me. I wish I was with my family. Aw, he's not with his family. Poor thing's all alone on Christmas. And then you cut me off, and that was the last straw. That's why I wanted to bang your butt. You I thought we agreed not to say that. All right. Listen, I-I-I'm sorry I cut you off. And I'm sorry you have to work on Christmas. That's rough. Tell me about it. I have to drive through the night to get from a Christmas Eve parade to a Christmas Day parade. Oh, that's an awful lot of driving. And a lot of information. Sounds like you're having a horrible Christmas. Great, we've bonded, can I lick your truck now? Yum. Probably the crappiest Christmas ever. Guess you just needed someone to take out your frustration on. Exactly! I thought we'd worked past the whole punching thing. Nope. Boy that felt good. Man, I really needed that. Hi, my name's Gary. Hey, Gary. Bob. You're pretty strong. Now, let's see if we can get you guys out of here, huh? Hey, how do you know if you have internal bleeding? I can tell. I can tell. Let me listen. Let me listen. All right! Here we go! Thanks, Gary! No problem. I'm gonna get back into my, uh prison on wheels now. Okay! Aw, you just need a little Christmas cheer in there. Bobby, give him the tree. What? No. The tree is the whole reason we Give him the tree! All right. That's so nice. Hey, come here. You ever have a Dutch Baby? Put that in your mouth. Merry Christmas. This is really good. You can't even taste the baby. Yeah. Oh, oh, God, he's so hungry, look. We got him! Oh my God, Teddy! Teddy is Santa! I found the Christmas card you didn't open. It's right there on the counter. Open the card while I'm here. You'd rather me do that than try and get the Open the card, then you can get the fridge off of me. Oh, well, anyway, it's just a cat. What does it say? It says ""Meow-y Christmas."" Yup, yeah. That's cute.  Hoo, ha, hoo, ha   Hoo, ha, hoo, ha  Jingle in the jungle, hope you bringle me a bundle   Jingle on my tingle  Santa, bring my favorite thingles   Some mittens for the monkeys  But make sure they're pretty funky   Some leggings for the lion, but remember he's size nine   Frogs and gators and monkeys immense   Everybody jingle to the jungle dance   We have candles and lights and jingle"
"There he is! Little King Trashmouth. Oh, what's he eating? A coffee filter filled with taco meat? No carbs for him, huh? Uh-oh. Oh, it's the one I call El Diablo! Like the Devil, yeah. One of these days, there's gonna be a rumble between those two. - Lin - I'm on the phone, Bob! Ginger, I wish you could see. The big one's all mangy and crazy-eyed. He looks like your cousin Cheryl. Aw, poor Cheryl. How's her psoriasis? Oh, my God. Lin Oh, she used to leave a trail of those flakes Lin, we're kind of trying to eat. Okay, Ginger. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Lot of raccoon talk. Oh, shush, she asked. She loves that stuff. You know, Ginger could've listened to me forever, but she had to take her daughter to a slumber party. Slumber party, huh? My condolences to Ginger's daughter. What? What's wrong with slumber parties? Yeah, and while we're at it, what's wrong with diarrhea, huh? Slumber parties are the cat's pajamas. Especially when I wear my cat pajamas. Wait. How many slumber parties have you been to? One and a half. I fell asleep at a regular birthday party. I'm counting that. You know, if you wanted to, you could have a slumber party here, Louise. You can invite girls from your class. Have you met the girls from my class, Mom? Here's what I'm pretty sure is going through their heads every moment of the day: Stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers! What kind of stickers? I love stickers. Anyway But, honey, you need a BFF like Ginger. Let me tell you, they're not easy to find. Got to slumber through a lot of parties to meet your Ginger. She's right; I had plenty of false starts before I met Ken. Who's Ken? His adult albino friend who does improvised hip-hop. Mm-hmm. Yep. But Ken's also not real. Hey! I had an imaginary friend. She used to steal from me. All my makeup, my lipsticks. Well, thanks for the life advice, everybody. Food for thought, ooh, yum. Full of it, lots of thoughts. I'm worried about Louise. What little girl doesn't want a slumber party? Are you really surprised, Lin? She's not the most social kid. She still hasn't accepted my friend request, and I know she's seen it. Ugh, drives me nuts. If Louise would just do the things she hates, I know she'd love it. That sounds like nonsense. Nonsense or mom-sense? I think you might be making too big a deal about this slumber party thing, Lin. It is a big deal. It's a part of growing up. Like getting braces or throwing rocks at cars. You used to throw rocks at cars? Yeah. Cars wouldn't even come down my street after a while, 'cause they knew Linda would get 'em. Okay, somebody give me a hand with the coffee table; We got to move it. Finally, we're giving this dump a makeover. I've been carrying these swatches around for years! No, guess again. What wait, what's going on, Lin? Oh, who could that be? Maybe it's for you, Louise. You better check. Sure. Strange visitors at a weird hour? Send your kid to the door! Go. I hope it's Matt Damon. I wrote him over a year ago. Hi, Louise. Slumber party! No. No, no, no, no, no! Ta-da! Louise, you're having your very own surprise slumber party. Ha ha! No! Bunch up, bunch up. Go.

You're being very rude to your guests, Louise. Am I, Mom? 'Cause let me tell you about my ""guests."" Fashion show That's Harley. Whoa, look at this fluffy boa snake. I'm glad it's not a real snake. Could you image it? It's fake; It's a boa. As in ""Harley ever shuts her mouth."" Louise, what are your ten favorite colors of dogs? Mine are red, brown spots, black, white, orange spots, kind of brown, kind of black, brown spots, black spots, red spots, red stripes And Jodi over there? She's so afraid of germs, she's never sat on a toilet seat. Or any seat! And then there's Abby. She likes to braid. Stop it! Stop braiding my mops, Abby! But they look so pretty. And finally, Jessica. Bland, boring Jessica. If she was a spice, she'd be flour. If she were a book, she'd be two books. Oh, yeah, she is boring. Well, you know what? By the end of the night, you're all gonna be good buddies. Uh-huh! She's Abby! She's got heels on! Ow! Ow! My ankles! Lawsuit! Okay, okay, you're okay. Come here, honey. Get up. Come on.

I'm gonna make the psychedelic crop top of my dreams! Gene, I only got enough shirts for Louise and the girls, honey. Hey, here's something you can do: You be the pesky brother! You're runnin' around, you're pullin' the little girls' pigtails On it! Don't you dare. Ow! Sorry! Um, I don't even want to do this. It's my job. I'm making it fun! How about me, Mom? What's my angle? Well, Tina, you're the older sister. You're over all this stuff. You want to go to the mall with your friends and beep each other on your beepers. Beep-beep! Cool. A sarcastic mall rat. As if. That's it! You're gettin' it! Okay. You're okay. No one knows. You'll deal with it in the morning. Go to sleep. All right! Harley, what you got? I made an orange and yellow tie dye, because my cat is orange and yellow. And my cat's name is Popover. What's your cat's name? My cat's name is I Don't Have A Cat Stop Talking To Me Right Now, Harley! Aw, so cute. Where is it? Okay, now you girls just sit tight. I'm gonna get these shirts out of your way. Louise, stop it! Stay. Okay. Ah, better check on Jessica. Jessica? You asleep? Aw, look at her. Snoozin' away. Sweet little, boring little lump. Whoops, oh, my tie-dyes. Got to get these to the tub. I'm just gonna make like a tree and go to my room. Can I braid your hair now? Say yes! If you have stickers I'll trade you, but my stickers are really rare so one of mine equals six of yours. Ugh I need antibacterial soap and your mom only has seashell-shaped soap. Ugh These are really rare. Please let me braid your hair. Oh, I could it around the side. I could do it across the top. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! It is time to turn this slumber party into a going-away party. Going-away party? That's awesome! Yeah, it's really gonna be fun! Why are you pinching my arm? Bob, are you at a good stopping place? Can I come in Oh, whew. I know. Whew, don't tell the little squeamish one you did that so close to her shirt. I won't bring it up, but if she asks, I'm not gonna lie to her. Next activity! Make your cupcakes pretty, everybody! And then we're gonna eat 'em up! Mrs. Belcher, could we turn our heads to the side so we don't breathe on each other's cupcakes? Uh sure. Whatever you need, Jodi. Everyone, turn your heads to the side. Ooh, okay, this is fun. We can't see what we're doing so well, right? Ooh, mystery cupcakes! Germaphobe, huh? Germs are all around us. They're in our scalp, in our eyebrows, in our mucus membranes. Someday, a cleansing rain will come. That's what I keep telling myself. That's what I keep telling myself. Oh, yeah, I'm looking forward to that day, Jodi. I really am. Yeah. So, uh what are you doing here? I mean, gosh, didn't they tell you, Jodi? Tell me what? - About my mom's - infection. She's got sewer palm. And strep thumb. Luckily, her whooping butt is in remission. Oh!  La la la la la la! I love sprinkles! Just let 'em sprinkle through your fingers! Oh, no! Germs! Germs! Everywhere! Ah! Unclean! Unclean! Jodi, Jodi, stop it! Jodi, Jodi Calm down. Ah, don't touch me! Okay, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Sewer palm! Sewer palm! Ah, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Bobby! Mr. Belcher's taking you home. Get her out. Really? Okay. Uh, let's go, Jodi. Oh, God. All right. One down. Hey, just 'cause Jodi had a freak-out doesn't mean the party's over. Who wants to watch a movie? Me! Ooh, I do! Two twins who live in Cincinnati. Oh, they're gonna eat chili on spaghetti! Sounds twin-teresting. Saddle up for round two. I know what everyone's thinking. A girl went home. Wouldn't it be perfect if Tina took her place in the slumber party? Thanks, but no thanks. Tina, you can watch the movie if you want. Oh, good. So how's school this year? It's okay. The classes good? I have trouble with math. Yeah, I never liked math. And I'm trying out for field hockey. Say again. Trying out for field hockey. I can't quite make out what you're saying, Jodi. It's okay. And that's the same actress playing both twins. They do it with a mirror. It's controversial 'cause it takes jobs away from other actresses who look like that actress. Please stop talking! You're ruining the shopping montage! Sorry about my brother. He gets a little sensitive when twins come up. Oh, why? Gene has a twin. George. He lives in the basement. In in the basement? You'll probably see George later. Mom lets him out at night so he can air out his hump, and his stump. Uh, I don't know if I want to meet him. Oh, of course you do! But when he's up here, just don't blink. Huh? If you blink, he goes crazy. Ooh. Also, he speaks in farts. Uh, what? And even if you think farts are funny 'cause they are just please do not laugh. Okay. 'Cause I laughed once Yeah? and he bit off a piece of my butt. What? That doesn't That's why I'm sitting like this. 'Cause I don't have two butt cheeks to sit on. Is that why you dance weird in dance class? Shut up, Harley. What's that noise? Oh, no. What are you up to, El Diablo? You get away from there. Oh, my God, the king's under attack! It's a rac-coup d'etat! Ha, hey, you girls still having fun, right? I'll be right back. Got to go deal with something. It's not a wild animal, so everyone's okay. Oh, Mom's probably going down to turn George loose. No, I-I don't want to meet George! Just don't look him in the eye, and you don't blink and don't laugh. But I don't want to have my bum bit. Oh! You just blinked. You need to practice not blinking. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What's what's going on in here? I-I want to go home. Take me home! Wait? Why? Okay, um are-are you sure? I-I just got back from taking Jodi home, so I'm sure, I'm sure! Well, she seems pretty sure, Dad. Does anyone else want to go home? Tell me now. Um, are you gonna let me braid your hair? Not a chance. I'll come, too. And we're done. Okay, if anyone needs me for anything, I'll be in my room forgetting tonight ever happened. Good-bye forever! Thank you, family! It was a nice try! Wait, what about the girl who went to bed early? Right. Jessica. All right, Snorey Feldman, up and at 'em! Huh? A walkie-talkie? Hello? Jessica? Uh, yup. What's up? Okay, I'll say it walkie-talkie style. The slumber party is over and out! Oh, no, I'm not leaving. Excuse me? Yeah, you're not getting rid of me like the other girls. Uh, ten-40. Love you, kisses. What? No! No kisses! Jessica! Oh, it is on like flan. Do you eat flan, Jessica? Because I've never had it! Louise? Am I taking Jessica home? Take the others home, Dad. I think Jessica wants to stay and play a while. So that means I'll still need to take her home later? Oh, yes, Father. Great. Okay, Jessica. What's your problem? Why the drama with the walkie-talkie? Where is it? Where is what? You know what. I know you're messing with me because that's what you did with everybody else. I would love to mess with you, Jessica. Unfortunately, I don't know what you're talking about. Wait, you seriously don't know what I'm talking about? No, but now I kind of want to know. Well, I can't leave until I find what I'm looking for. So let's just play it cool and respect each other's situations. Uh, okay, I'll respect your situation. Right here in the closet! Gah! Wait a second. These walkie-talkies were in my bedroom. Oh, yeah, your bedroom. It's nice in there. You picked my lock? It practically picked itself. You pick yourself! You pick your nose! You pick your butt! You pick your nose because you think your face is a butt! And you should think that! Gene, Tina, where is everybody? Bob, I need you in the bedroom. What's wrong with your hair? What's right with it. Abby braided it. Kids, how's the party? Is everyone having fun? They're about to get to the part where the mayor renames the city ""Twincinnati."" The plot's got some holes. But also a whole lot of heart. All right! Uh, keep slumber partying! Good pun, Tina. Come on. Thank you. Ow! Shut the door! What's going on? Ginger, I know, I'm about to tell him. Yeah, no, he's got his hair braided. Pretty good, it looks pretty good. Lin! I got to go. Bobby, stay calm. We are harboring a royal fugitive. What? Oh, my God, Lin! There's a raccoon! It's Little King Trashmouth. He's chewing on my good sock. Yeah, He found it under there and he rubbed his scent glands on it on it and now it's his baby aw! Lin, why is he here?! 'Cause El Diablo attacked him tonight. So I lured him in with some cold cuts. He needs our help. Okay, this is nuts, Lin! Oh, he sounds anxious. Get him some wine. ""Get him some wine""? He likes red. A little too much. Listen, We have an intruder on the loose in this apartment. Wait, is the intruder Jessica? Yeah. Here's what we know by day, Jessica is red-headed wallpaper. By night, apparently she's a master of sneaking around our house and looking for God knows what. I say we help her find her purpose in life. A brand consultant! Huh, I can see that. No, hitting the bricks! Lin, I don't want a raccoon in our room. I know. I mean, I don't agree, but I understand. More importantly, we need to take care of this fast so I can get this slumber party back on track. There is no slumber party; I drove the slumber party home. There's still one girl here, I think. I know what we can do. What? We could trap El Diablo. With him gone, the king can return. That's ridic Whoa! He just looked right into my eyes. See? Oh, my God, he just raised his paw. I think he just gave me the double guns. We could hire Teddy to help us. He has a live animal trap from the time he thought a squirrel was stealing his mail. Sure, that Hey, buddy. How you doing? Let's put a hat on him. All right! You hear that, El Diablo? We're coming for you. All right, let's just keep this a secret from the kids, right? We don't want them coming in here and getting bitten. Aw, babies getting rabies. Why don't we tell Mom and Dad about Jessica? They could make her come out. Oh, no. She's mine. Mom is not gonna have anything more to do with this slumber party. You hear that, Jessica? Or should I say Jessi-can't find what she's looking for? Yeah, I hear you. But all it sounds like is this. You know what Jessica? Why do you even want to stick around here, sweet baby? This slumber party's not good enough for you. Yeah, the hors d'oeuvres were blah. And Louise's family kind of smells. Just tell me what you're looking for and I'll help you find it so you'll leave my house. I can't. And I can't tell you why I can't. Oh, and also I won't. Don't be boring and mysterious, Jessica. You can't have it both ways! - Got to go. Click. - She hung up. She didn't hang up. Louise, look! Louise, you should say, ""I'll take what's behind curtain number one."" Because she's there behind the curtain. Jessica, it's curtains for you. Oh! That's better. Who could be hidden behind a little curtain? I wonder. It could be Dad. He has dainty feet. And Dad likes to hide from us sometimes. Okay, it's me. Happy now? I'll be happy when you leave. I'll leave when I find my thing. Until then, slumber party on. All right, you want a slumber party? Well, then say pillow to my little friend! Whoa. Pillow fight. It's about to go down. Goose down. I know you're close, Jessica. I can hear your boring breathing. Oh, Tina? Yes? Gene, is this your first time as a human shield? Yeah. It's my third time. You're doing great. Thank you. Oh! I'm gonna knock you out the door! Gene, get me the memory foam pillows from Mom and Dad's room. Fat Man and Little Boy? On it! I came as quickly as I could. Is it true? Was the king deposed? Yup. There's the bastard now. Yeah, look at him. El Diablo. When did you both become crazy raccoon people? Linda's been telling me stories about these little guys. It's like I'm part of their magical world. Mm-hmm. Well, let's set up the trap and get this over with. What are we gonna bait it with? Huh? The bait. Bobby, you can make him a burger. Burger, yeah! He won't be able to resist. Right. Ugh, guys, I don't want to make a burger for a raccoon. Please, Bobby? You can even name it like you like to do. You call it a Medium Snare burger. Right? Hmm. No, wait. The Cage-in burger. Oh. Get it? Because he's gonna be in a cage? Fine, I'll do it. But I'm not naming it. Oh, good, all right, yay. Bobby, thank you! Medium Snare burger. Right, Bob? That wasn't so hard. Bob makes it sound so hard. Having fun Jessica? Oh, yeah! Tons! Thanks for inviting me! Raccoon! Raccoon in the tub! Aah! What the Aah! Aah! Give it! Give it! Um, I'm no park ranger, but if a weird raccoon is holding something, let him keep it. Wha! Raccoon! Raccoon in the tub! Code orange! Code orange! Give it! Give it! Aah! Give me that! What is it? Pajama bottoms? And they're wet with pee? Are you a bed wetter? Is that what this is all about? It's not pee! If it is, that raccoon really likes your pee, Jessica. What's your secret? No! It wasn't me! Your mom came in here and she peed all over the place! I saw it! Mmm, that does sound like Mom. Aah! Whoa! Whatever your pee is selling, that raccoon is buying. Great, everybody have a big laugh. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Do you think this is gonna work? Have faith in your burger, Bobby. Look. He's going for it. Oops, I spoke too soon. What if he doesn't like your burger? That would be really embarrassing. Shh. Of course he's gonna like it. Not necessarily. Look at him. Sniffing around. He does not like what he smells, Bobby. I'm not arguing this with you, Teddy. You didn't cook it well enough. You didn't cook it well enough. Should've put some ketchup on Nope, he's eating it. Going home, huh, Jessica? Yup, just waiting for your dad to come back so he can drive me. Good. You really cut into my night. So, I guess you're gonna tell everyone at school about this, right? I'm not gonna tell anybody. I'm no narc. Oh. Make fun of you for wetting the bed? What is this, the '90s? Come on. You got a good system, though, huh? Bring plastic bags, go to bed early, then get up first and dispose of the evidence? Yup. So why go to slumber parties at all? My mom makes me. She's out of control. Well, I wouldn't know anything about that. Psych, my mom's crazy, too. Oh. Hey, you're pretty good with a pillow by the way. Thanks. Self-taught. So, do you get a lot of raccoons in here? Why, you jealous? Yeah, a little bit. Hey, what are you two still doing up? Oh, do you want a ride home now, Jessica? Okay, I guess it's time. What? It's a slumber party. Why would she go home? Whoa, wait a second. You two are having a good time. Ugh, Mom, stop! Aw, my little BFFs. Shush! See, I knew you'd like it. It all worked out the way I thought it would. Tomorrow we're going clothes shopping. No! Yeah. No. Yeah. Here he goes. He's almost out. Go, Bobby, go! Aw, sorry, King. Great broom work, Dad. Yeah! If I was a raccoon, I'd leave. He's out. Now we can all go to bed. Psst! King! Drink responsibly. Okay, good night."
"""Festival of Magic""? This whole town's gonna be full of magicians turning tricks! Hi, Jimmy, Jr. Hi, Zeke. What are you wearing? Is it cape o'clock, already? It's for the Young Magicians Competition. I'm in it to win it. Abraca-yeah-bro! I support ya! I didn't know you were into magic. I thought you were more into dancing. Well, I dance a lot during my magic. Like this.  Ta-da! Whoa! Where'd the hell that come from?! He's like a magical florist! Thank you. Oh. Whoop! Maybe I'll come to the competition and cheer for you. Whatever. It's a free country. He's so patriotic. Okay, then, see you at our date. It's not a date. Yes, it is. Not really. Pretty much, it is a date. Definitely not. Whoop. Oh, this promotion is a great idea, Bob! I love magic! I know. Me, too. Ooh, I'm gonna stick a quarter in my ear, so they have something to pull out. Yeah, the only problem is, this sign could actually attract magicians, so Louise, this will be good for business. Plus, magic is fun. Mm-mm. Magic can take you to places you could never possibly imagine. Like Delaware! Oh, look, here comes our first magician. Or a Wild West wedding DJ? Hello. Hello Hello. Um, I couldn't help but notice your sign. Notice anything else? Whoops. Uh, oh, where'd that come from? Uh, come on in, Mr., uh Mars Sazerac. Boy, that is a magicky name. Hold on. How do we know you're a magician? Show us a trick! Oh, write my name on a piece of cake, put it in a box, and I'll eat it! Sorry, don't listen to him. He's just wants to eat cake. Fine, write it on a piece of pizza and put it under my desk. It's always gonna have something to do with eating something. Just hiding food in places that he already knows the location of. I mean, it would be nice to see something, like a trick. Well, I suppose me and my 52 friends could use the exercise. Oh, God, it's happening! Miss, could I ask you to be my assistant? Oh, I couldn't. No. Okay I'll do it! Oh, that's right, magicians have assistants Ta-da. Now I'll need a volunteer Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! You're already the assistant, Linda. Oh. You win. No need to shout. Thank you. Bye, Gene. Bye. Okay, Bob, let's move you over here so the audience can see you. Right here? Perfect. Now, you're going to pick a card. And while you're doing that, Linda's going to get me your biggest knife. I have it right here. Butcher knife, check! Whoa, why do you have that? Me and Gene were playing pirates. Mm-hmm. Pick a card, Bob. Show it to them, not me. Okay, everyone, here's my card. Nice one, Dad. Okay. That was not a very good trick. Now, Linda, cut the deck, literally. Go on! Whack it! All right, step back. Whaaah! Whoa! Still not a great trick. Well, well, looks like we have a survivor. Recognize this?! Ha-ha! That's not my card. Oh. Hit the bricks, Fail-dini! You had your shot, you blew it. Well, so much for the magician's discount. In fact, maybe I should pay you. Wait that looks like my wallet. Did you take my wallet? Oh-ho-ho, slow down, there, Bob. Before you call the cops, you'd better check the I.D. My card! Oh, my! Wait how did you pick my pocket? I didn't feel anything. Oh, I feel something. I feel like I want to magically steal things, too. This must be what it's like when people get called to the priesthood. I accept. Whoa! I've seen canned tuna, but never canned Tina! Ugh! You're such a locker stalker. Good one, Tammy. I know. Oh, hi, Jimmy Jr. It's like I was padlocked in a box, and you set me free. Um, okay. Hi. How did you know my locker combination? It only took a couple thousand tries. Allow me. Okay. Is there anything else I could assist you with? Uh, I need to get my science book. This perfectly ordinary textbook. Thanks. You know, I could also assist you with your magic act as your magician's assistant. Classy. Like a lady butler. Um, okay, I-I guess you could do that. I practice after school. Oh, okay, cool. All right, see ya. Yes! Yes! Yes! What? What? Oh, I just found a cool book I've been meaning to read. Oh, it's mine. Oh. That's his! Can I borrow it? No, I don't think so. I kinda need it. Okay, I'll read it here. Bye. Um, Jimmy Junior?! What, Tina? Maybe I should be facing the audience, too? Fine. Um okay, there's more? Remember? The blades? I remember! Stupid magic.  Ta-dance! Uh, hello? Jimmy Jr.? What, Tina? If this were a dancing competition, forget about it. But you might want to put a little more flair into the actual magic. What makes you such an expert, Tina? You've only been doing magic for a day. I've been doing it for nine days! Jimmy Jr., they spilled a crate of yogurt in the cafeteria! Let's go slide around in it! Cool, Zeke. Come on! Let's go! Wait up, Zeke! Okay, I'll be here. Sweep up all the confetti, okay? Okay, Gene, let's start with an easy mark. Uh, there we go. You distract while I extract. Got it. Andy, there's something I need to ask you, but you have to really focus on me while I'm saying these words! Oh, okay! I'll focus, too! I've never done that before! What do you think of bacon? Hmm? Bacon, bacon, bacon. Andy, someone's trying to steal your candy! Ugh! Thanks, Ollie! You're welcome, Andy! Damn it, Ollie! How did you know?! I felt it coming out of Andy's pocket! Get a womb, you wacky twins. That hurt my feelings. I felt it hurt your feelings! You did? Yes! Ah-choo! Oh, I wish somebody had a really long handkerchief up their sleeve. Anybody? Hmm? Come on. Where's the pizazz-matazz? I thought they'd get more food. They split an order of fries three hours ago and they haven't ordered anything since. Now they're just loitering. They tricked you, Bob! It's what they do! So, Sazerac, can I get you and your friends anything else? Remember, it's half off, so don't hold back. Ah, well, your delicious fries have left my fingers greasy. Bring me a huge plate of napkins. Well, how 'bout a burger? I can get you a Napkins. All right, napkins. Get him a napkin. Hey, Bob, I think he got your wallet again. And keys! And your gas pills! And your dignity. Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha, great. Hi, I'm looking for a magician's assistant's costume. Something classy! So no butt cheek! Well, you're in luck! This is my last assistant's costume in your size. The sequins are French crystal. Well, French-Canadian. Is that good? How much do you know about sequins? Nothing. They're the best. She'll take it! Rented! Okay, what else? How's your magician set for cups and balls? I beg your pardon! Oh That looks pretty advanced. My magician's better with his feet than his hands. He's more of a dance-ician? Well, for those with only the slightest sleight-of-hand, you can't go wrong with magic rope.  Ta-da! Great. I'll take that too. The only thing I need now is some magic between me and my magician. Whoa, whoa, whoa Are you talking about mixing magic and romance? Big time. Don't do it! It's dangerous. Also, don't mix magic with taxes. Or plumbing. That's okay danger is my middle name. But I spell it R-U-T-H. It spells Ruth. Yeah. Yeah, it does. Mm-hmm. Looks like there's a wait, huh? Yeah. Maybe I'll just come back later. Oh, hold on, that guy's getting up. No, he's levitating! What? Nope, he was just leaning over to fart. You know what? I'll handle this. What are you gonna do? Yeah, wait, you'll see. What? Look, guys, you've been here all day working on one order of fries, so Understood, Bob. Let me settle my tab. Do you have change for this? Sorry I don't have anything smaller. No, you know what? To be honest, Sazerac, I don't even enjoy this anymore. I don't, I, I, honestly don't even like magic that much now, because of you. So, you and your friends, you now all pay full price. No magicians' discount. Well, if that's how you feel, you can have your fries back. Oh, my God. Oh, God! Look, it says ""Ta-da""! That's it! I don't care that that was good. You and your regurgitated potatoes and the rest of your magic buddies, you're banned! Bob, you can't just ban them! This isn't the '60s, you know! Fellow conjurers, let's go somewhere our craft is appreciated. Like my mother's! Oh, and one last thing, Bob. Your name goes in the book. What book? The ""Enemies of Magic"" book. Good! I want to be in your stupid book because I am an enemy of magic! Well, then this is the perfect book for you! Will this page do? Love it! Don't gasp, Linda! Oh! Don't you gasp! Rest assured, Bob, I will never set foot in this restaurant again. And yet, you will never be rid of me! I just got chills! Oh, my God. Come on, J-Ju, get your dance on! I'm doing it, Zeke. My little tiny dancer. Here we go! Look, Jimmy Jr. I got something new for our act magic rope. Cool! A rope! No, that's not how it works. Yee-hah! Whoo! No Giddy up, magic cowboy! Come on! Look, you're supposed to cut the rope, then restore it. I can show you. Oh, cool, scissors! Hyah! Hyah! Jimmy Jr., stop. Snipping and a-whipping. Doola-di-doo! Jimmy Jr., stop. Tina, move! Listen to me! Stop it, Tina. I can't dance to the sound of you telling me what to do. Yeah! Boom! I'm trying to help. Assist me assist you. You know what, Tina? This isn't working. That's why we have to keep practicing. No, this isn't working. I am firing you. What? You can't stop my dancing! You can't tie me up with your magic rope! Holy moly! Tell it, James Ju! I'm not trying to tie you up, you gorgeous idiot! Maybe I should enter this stupid contest myself just to show you an actual magic act! You see that, Zeke? Yeah. She got pretty mad. She's a trip. Her face turned purple. Plus, you're not even a magician, Tina. I am now! Oh. It worked in the store. Look, Zeke, tassels! Yeah! Come on, let me touch 'em. So, you and your magician split up big surprise. Jimmy Junior thinks assistants should be sequined and not heard. So, presto. Now I'm the magician. So, uh what do you got for this no-trick pony, eh? Set her up. Young lady, you're in luck. Here's a classic of escapology the straitjacket. Last one in your size. It just takes a little bit of practice and some dislocateable shoulders. I'll dislocate Jimmy Junior's heart and my shoulders. You sound like you could use the full revenge package. For just $19.95, you could get this Hmm interesting. When Doves Cry. The Art of Magic Sabotage. No, thanks. I want to win fair and square. Keeping it clean? I have just the thing. A-ha. A Guide to Not Cheating in Magic Competitions. I'll just take the straitjacket. It's not going to be the last time she says that. It's our family motto! Wow. This place looks pretty big without all those magicians in it. Ah! Oh! Whoa! Oh! Oh Wow, that's never happened before. That flustered the heck out of me. Can I get some water, Bobby? Yeah, sure. What the hell? Bobby, it's the curse! Oh! What curse? The Curse of Sazerac! Linda's right, Bob. You're cursed. You're in the ""Enemies of Magic"" book. We're not cursed. We're not cursed. You are. You're the one who's cursed. Yeah. It's your name in the book. The black magic death book. Look, it's just a bunch of stupid tricks. Someone must've snuck in and Where are you going? What? Nowhere. Just, if something heavy falls on you, I don't want to I mean, I want to be able to help you, bye. I'm not cursed! Aah! I don't want to die!  Don't be so into tragic  Shoop-shoop, shoop-shoop  Who should face a straitjacket?   Shoop-shoop, shoop-shoop  Don't be so into magic  Shoop-shoop, shoop-shoop  Doo-wah!  Don't be so into magic  Who should face a straitjacket?   Dub-a-doo, dub-a-doo, da! I'm not sure I can escape from my straitjacket. Maybe I should have stuck to being an assistant. No you're really talented. Hah! Tammy? What are you doing? I'm Jimmy Junior's new assistant. You coul't en wait until the Zig-Zag box was cold? Oh, I thought I smelled your B.O. in there. Uh-oh. Battle of the training bras. I feel like I'm back in diapers at divorce court! You know what really stinks, Tammy? His act. It's not magic, it's tragic. Don't be such a rhymin' hymen, Tina. Yeah, Tina. You're not even good at it. Yeah, Tina. Oh, Jimmy Junior, you make me so mad! What are you gonna do about it? I'll take it. Here you go! Do you have something caught in your throat? That was my evil laugh. I also have something caught in my throat. And we're in. His magic cape won't be so magic when the hidden pockets are stapled shut. Guys, code red, Hocus and Dopus! Tina, start stapling! Hurry! Done. Go! Split up! You missed the cape, Tina! Oh, hi, Jimmy Junior. We were just leaving in that direction. Man, I wish I had siblings I could walk that close with. My brother's 44. There has to be something else in here that will ruin Jimmy Junior. This one would be great, if we had eight weeks, and a fireman's hose. Ooh, look at this one. ""Find the heart of his act, and cut it out."" Like when Shelley Long left Cheers. Okay, Tina, time to put on your straitjacket. Oh, all this white, it's like your wedding day. Oh, I'm tearing up! Thank you, Mother. I must prepare. Boy, she's really in the zone, huh? Uh, I think I should stay here, Lin. Protect the restaurant from another Sazerac attack. A Saz attack. Forget the restaurant, Bob. You're gonna be cursed, no matter what. You might as well come support your daughter. And let's be honest, Dad, how much more cursed can you really get? What, is he gonna give you an even weirder body? Thanks, Louise. You got it. Great. Sazerac's the emcee. I can't get away from that idiot. So maybe I'm going to get even with him. What? I mean uh, nothing. Be right back. Good luck, Tina. Okay, my little Teenie-Weenie Houdini! Go kick some butt! Some butt, or one butt? Okay We need to go, too, Mom. Uh, I'm Tina's silk scarf wrangler. And I'm the one who has to make sure there's nothing up her sleeves. I love that. All right, Team Tina! Go, Team Tina! Enjoy your complimentary cold-cuts, Saza-jerk! The ""Enemies of Magic"" book! David Cassidy? Larry Bird?! Diane Keaton? Ha! My name's not in your book anymore, Sazerac, but this is! Uh-oh, that's not good. Ow. That's a peppercorn. Say that again. Now we cut out the heart of Jimmy Junior's act and put in this. ""Poly-rhythmic synth-jazz""! No one can dance to that. That's right. Not even Jimmy Junior. Yeah! Here's the new music for Jimmy Junior's act. Um, I don't see anything on my list about new music. Look, we did a Kickstarter to make this music Oh, okay, okay! All right! Oh, boy. I snuck into Sazerac's dressing room and I found his stupid book and tore my name out. What? You did what? Ooh Ooh, you smell like salami. Thank you, and welcome to the Young Magician's Competition! These kids are the magic stars of the future. Well, not all of them. Some will give up, become teachers, doctors I know, I know. I agree, but come on. Let's hear it for our first contestant, The Amazing Jimmy Pesto Junior and his assistant, Tammy Larson! That's not my music. Just go with it. I can't dance to this! Damn it! It looks like he's having a funky stroke. I miss you, Grandpa! This doesn't bother me at all, watching my almost boyfriend get horribly humiliated Ah! Yes, it does! I can't do this! I gotta save him. It's not too late. Oh, maybe it is too late. Still, I've gotta try. What are you doing out here? Trying to save you. I switched your music to something with a nine-eight time signature. That's like dance Kryptonite! I know, I'm sorry. I was really mad at you for firing me and for replacing me with Tammy. I'm sorry, too, for being so sensitive about my dancing. So what do we do now? We have the rest of our lives to figure that out. No, I mean right now. Oh. Get off the stage, Tina! You're not his assistant. I am! Deal with it! Sorry, Tammy, I can't hear you while you're rolling away so fast. Aah! Hi, Tammy! Bye, Tammy! Great magic! Well, should I do a trick? No, I'll be the magician and you assist me with your dancing. I told you, I can't dance to this music! And I probably can't get out of this. But follow my lead anyway. Okay, Tina. Is this part of the show? Yeah, right? Do a trick! And now, with the help of my lovely assistant, I will perform an amazing escape from the Jacket of Doom. Huh. I thought we were getting revenge. More like revenge on us, having to watch. Ho-ho. And now for the master to become the mark This isn't going well Aah!  Ta-dance. Hah! And now, for the winner of the Young Magician's Competition The envelope, please! I can't believe you got out of that thing. How'd you do it? Magic. Would you mind popping my shoulder back in? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Now, that's what I call air mail! The $500 grand prize goes to Peter Pescadero, the Impescadaralist! I can't turn it off! Thank you! And the Honorable Mention Award for On-Stage Chemistry goes to Tina Belcher and Jimmy Pesto Junior! Go, Tina! What?! ""On Stage Chemistry""? That's almost as good as off-stage chemistry. Why don't you two nerds go have wizard babies? Enjoy your prize. A $50 gift certificate from Wands! Wands! Wands! magic shop. Can not be applied to the purchase of wands. Sweet. Thanks, Tina. Don't thank me, thank my lips. Thanks, lips! See ya! Now I see him, now I don't. Way to go, Tina! Your trick was the best! Everyone was talking about it. Thanks, Mom. Cool if we don't hug? So you won the Honorable Mention Onstage Chemistry award. That's something, right? No, I've thought about it and I don't think it is anything. Meanwhile, I picked my first pocket. Sazerac's. Oh, the ""Enemies of Magic"" book. Thanks, Louise, but I already tore my name out and look what I put in. Wait, what is this? ""Look on the back of the page you tore out."" ""Dear Bob, I knew this is how it would end ""you sneaking into my dressing room, ""licking my cold-cuts, ""and ripping your name out of the book, which I then let Louise take from my pocket."" He let me take it? Wow. That guy is good. Yeah, he's great! There's a P.S. ""P.S. I farted on the meat."" Oh! Oh, God! Oh! Well, I hope you learned your lesson, Bob. Don't lick meat. Disagree."
"Ah, hmm, looks like Jimmy Pesto's big Super Bowl weekend is starting early. No, no, no. Higher. Every year it starts earlier and earlier. Like ant season under Gene's bed. I'm having my own Super Bowl blowout this year. I'm holding all of my BMs until halftime, when I will make a Super Bowel! Gene, you can't hold your poops in, all right? You got to set 'em free where they can go down the sewer and they find their families and they're happy! I'm their family! I raised them! Hey, you know what? We should do our own Super Bowl promotion. You know, for people who want the option to have good food. Great idea, Dad. We can have people over and order a bunch of Thai. What? No, Tina. I'm talking about our food. Oh, right. That'll work, too. Hmm? What's that jerk up to? Ugh. What do you want, Jimmy? Hey, saw your little sign. What are you gonna do, listen to the game on the radio and then go out and tell everybody what happened? Come on. What are you talking about? You don't have a TV! Yeah, we do. It's right there. Right there. Where? I don't s Uh, where? Oh, yeah! Little fella. Yeah! And it has good horizontal hold! Sheesh! How old is that thing? The players are all gonna have English accents. Ah! 'Cause England's old. Don't hold my hand. Get out of here, Jimmy. Yeah. It's no wonder every year my place is packed for the game, while you serve two customers. He's talking about us. Look alive, Mort! Oh, yeah? Well-well, we have our own Super Bowl idea, Jimmy. Yeah! Is it my Super Bowel? Bigger. Impossible! Our idea's gonna get us more business on Sunday than you. Yeah, that's right, yeah. You go, Dad. Our place will be packed, and yours will be empty. Ha! Like Trev's soul. Heh. Whoa. I'm sorry. That's cute that you think that, Bob. Almost as cute as your little cooking booties. They happen to be clogs, Jimmy. Yeah? Well, go back to Holland, you windmill! He's not a windmill. You'll see, Jimmy. My idea's gonna destroy you. Monday morning, you're gonna be like, ""What the hell happened?"" and I'm gonna be like, ""Bob's idea happened!"" So, what do you got, Bob? I got nothing. Aw, nuts. No, Dad, we've got nothing. Thanks, Tina. Here's something. It's a grocery list. Hurry back, and I'll make zucchini and wienie paninis. You'll love 'em. Yay. Yay. What am I gonna do to bring in more business? Can't let Pesto win. Again. I have an idea. What is it, zucchini? You could kill Jimmy Pesto. Yeah, I could kill him. Yeah, kill him today with me. Shove me down his throat. That's a great idea. No one It's a perfect murder. Watch out for that truck! Or Or what? Nothing. Forget it. Just go back in the bag. A 15-second local Super Bowl commercial is only $3,000. We can afford it, barely. I don't know, Bob. We'd have to empty almost all our savings. What if it doesn't work? It will work. When everyone in the bi-county area sees our commercial, they'll come to our restaurant. I didn't know our county was bi. Good for us. I'm telling you, Lin, we'll make that money back and then some. This is just about you wanting to one-up Jimmy Pesto. No, Lin. The fact that our commercial will play on all of Jimmy Pesto's stupid 18 televisions during the game has nothing to do with it! Th-This is about growing our family business. We'll get so big, we'll run Mort off his land and take his goats! We'll get so rich, we'll never be happy again! $3,000 is a lot of money, Bobby. But a Super Bowl commercial is a game-changer, Lin, and it'll be fun. No. We'll put the whole family in it. No, I don't think You could sing a song.  Let's do it! The Belchers are making a commercial!  A family commercial! Finally, people have a reason to watch the Super Bowl! This is an impressive savings account here. And then here's yours. See the difference? Yes. Good planning; Careful saving. No apparent plan; Small, random deposits. Yes, I-I, uh, I get it. Something. Nothing. Okay, you've made your point. Good. I mean, I shouldn't even be showing you this other account, but I couldn't think of another way to try to help you. Well, actually, it's kind of hurtful. Aw. Yes, I'm basically emptying our account, but it's worth it to have a commercial during the Super Bowl. I mean, I'll be back in here in no time depositing twice as much. Oh, that'll be fun. I'll have our vault enlarged. Okay, uh, financing is in place. Now we just need a $3,000 idea for the family commercial. So, uh, let's do it. What do we got? Bobby, I know a guy who used to be in the NFL; I bet you could get him. Really? That could be great. I don't know. Celebrity endorsement? Sounds a little hoity-toity. Yeah, that might be a little slick for us. It's something Pesto would do. We'll keep it simple just the food and the family. How about a slogan? Uh, ""Where's the burger? Between Bob's buns."" Hmm. Uh, well, not that. How about this? ""Bob's Burgers, like a beef in the night."" Mm, no. Huh. You can be the Joint Beefs of Staff. I don't think so. Um, how about, uh, ""I beef, you beef, we'll all beef, uh, at Bob's Burgers."" Not great, Teddy. Something like that. Oh, oh! ""Come meet our family and let us meat you."" Get it? Meat? Ha! Hey, Louise, that's pretty good. I'm the smart one! That's good? Yeah, that could work. Lin, you could sing that. Well, yeah, I Yeah, yeah. Yes, now I hear it. Gene! Give me something bouncy. Ma, go! Uh, two, three!  Come meet our family  And let us meat you  Bob's Burgers. That's great! Ha-ha-ha! I mean, not that exactly, but something like that. I mean, we'll work on it. It just flew out of me. I don't It just came out. Wow, I love that. Yeah, then we just add some dialogue and show the burgers. This is gonna work. Not to be a Missy Pissy, but how are we going to make the commercial in just four days? Well, there is one guy we could call. I love it! That'll be $1,500. Worth it! This is Randy. I still can't believe you want to work with Randy. How many times are you gonna let him hurt you? We don't know anyone else who can do this stuff, and he's cheap. I wrote it; I should be the one directing it, not some idiot. Louise. All the best movies were written and directed by one girl. The man did glue a wig on a cow. And that worked out. All right, here he is; Get it out now. Randy's a pain in the butt. He has bad breath. He pees sitting down, facing the toilet! He smells like a hamster cage! He's average height. Tina, that's not really an insult. Okay, here he is. Hey, buddy. Hello, Belchers. You're stupid. What? Nothing. Hey, uh, what did you think about the script? What did I think about the script? Did a kid write it? Actually, yes. This kid. Me. And just to explain who's in charge, this is a point-and- shoot operation; I point and you shoot. Well, we will see about that. No, I'm the puppet master, and you're the guy who gets the puppet master a glass of water. Uh, puppets can't get water for people. That's not true. There's a lot of movies where puppets get water for people. Okay, guys, guys, guys I-I am a filmmaker. Name one movie where puppets get water for people. Pretty Woman. I will have to rent that and see. Come on. Randy, look at this. Pretty good, huh? Miniature city for our big final shot. It's not awful. And Linda and Tina unroll the banner. With glamour.  While we sing. Lovely. And where's the banner? Ha! There Oh, there, yeah. Wow. That's great. You spelled ""meat"" with little hamburgers. So you know it's meat. They look like little butts, Tina. Yeah, it works on every level. Action! action! Only I say ""action,"" and I just said it, so action!  Come meet our family  And let our family meat you. Hey, meat me. Cut! Cut! Cut, cut. Everybody stop saying ""cut."" I will say ""cut."" Oh, I screwed that up. My fault. Butterfingers over here. Everyone was wrong. Cut. Sorry. No. There's one for your blooper reel, right? Show that at the wrap party. At Bob's Burgers, we use only the freshest ingredients. Cut. Tina, what was that? A sexy hair flip. Why? Was it too sexy? No, just why are you doing that? It's for my ""wow"" factor. So Jimmy Jr. sees the commercial and goes, ""Wow."" Stick to the script, Tina. You can weird it up in the mirror whenever you want, 'kay, doll? And action, Burger-Zilla! Bob's Burgers has the biggest flavor in all the land! Bah! Bah! Bah! Gene. What? And cue Linda! So come come by Bob's Burgers today  After the game And cue the banner! Tell us football sent you. Mm! And cut! That's a wrap! I'm a director! We did it! I did it! I did! We're the best family ever!  And let us meat you. Oh, my God. ""Oh, my God,"" you love it? Oh, my God, we're screwed. ""Oh, my God, we're screwed,"" you love it? No. Oh, my God, we're screwed, we're screwed. ""Oh, my God, we're screwed, we're screwed,"" you love it? No. Oh, my God, we're screwed, we're screwed, we're really, really, really screwed. Hey, Bob, what do you think? Why did I think this was a good idea? Why did I throw all our money away on this? Despite the brilliant camera work, I think the problem is the script written by a nine-year-old. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Learn to direct, you hack. I am learning. Bobby, it's not that bad. It is that bad, Lin. The banner broke, Tina did that weird thing with her hair, Teddy can't catch a burger. I just couldn't get my head around my character. All right, so what do we do, Mr. Super Troll? We already bought the airtime; We got to air something. Here's what you need Fire Randy I don't think that's the answer. I'll direct it, like I should have in the first place, and it'll frickin' sparkle! Maybe I could try spinning my hair the other way. Like this. Teddy, what's the name of that NFL guy you know? No. Sandy Frye. Want me to call him? No. Do you think he'd work for less than $500? Well, he really wants to break into acting. He'd probably do it just for the experience. Great. What?! We can tell people to come to Bob's Burgers after the game and meet a real NFL player. They'll be running out of Pesto's to come here! A football player in a Super Bowl commercial it's a slam dunk! You want to replace my commercial with Sandy Frye? Not replace, Louise, just reshoot a little, add some stuff. I thought a celebrity endorsement was too slick for us. Let's just take the family out of the family commercial, then we'll take the burgers out, then the restaurant out it'll be great! It's still a family commercial, Louise. We're just adding a new member to the family who has name recognition, and is more appealing. Mom, you're letting this happen? Well, you know, I let a lot of stuff happen I don't like. Gene's haircut What? I want to feather it. Come here. I want my name off this project and my last name off my name! Now it's just Louise Louise! Sandy ""Can-Can"" Frye. Here we go. Highlight reel. Why do they call him ""Can-Can""? Oh, yeah, I remember. Every time he sacked a quarterback, he'd celebrate by doing the can-can. That was his thing. It was a simpler time. I also brought in some props to make the new final shot look more footbally. Some pom-poms for Linda. Rah-rah! Pom-poms for the mom-moms! For Gene, I brought this mouth guard, which I need back by tonight. I grind my teeth. And a referee shirt for Louise. No way. I'm not being the referee. I took the shirt off my teddy bear, and you're the only one who it'll fit. Tough break, Randy. Sorry about your naked bear. Louise, a word, please? Listen to me! I know we've had our differences, but I need this! Admit you're a hack, and I'll do it. I am not a hack! Then I'm not a ref. Fine, I'm a hack! But I'm learning, and soon I won't be a hack. But you you'll always be a little girl. He said he's a hack! Just so you know! Good girl, Louise. Cooperation! Did someone here order an NFL legend? Because next door, they did not, and they yelled at me to leave. Hi. I'm Sandy. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to act in your commercial. I've been working on my accents. Which would you prefer? ""G'day, mate"" or ""That's a-spicy""? I, um I Can you do a Russian accent? Can I? 'Ey! I'm a-Russian! It's a-so cold, it's a No, I cannot. Oh. I'm sorry. I think just your regular voice will be great, Sandy. I'm playing myself? Yes. You got it, Bob. I'm here to carry out your vision, even if you don't want me to do an accent. Now that's a great attitude! Great attitude, terrible concept for a commercial, hack director. Let's do this! Yeah, let's do this! I was being sarcastic, Sandy. And I was ignoring it, little tiny person. Why do you eat at Bob's Burgers, Sandy? Because your burgers go great with Frye. Sandy Can-Can Frye! Right on! See, it's already working. People love Sandy! Except that guy ruined the shot. Because your burgers go great with Frye. Okay, that's a wrap! Wow! Great day, everyone! Great day! Hey, all this acting makes me hungry. Let's celebrate with some sesame cheddar blasts. Uh, we don't have that. And maybe some toasted jalapeÃ±o points. Is that a thing? Mozzarella volcanoes? Uh, we just have burgers and fries, so See you Sunday! Okay great, Sandy. Thank you. You were amazing. You were amazing, Sandy. I want to marry you so I can be Bob Can-Can. I wouldn't take his name. I'm thinking, uh, what if we maybe zoom in a little more? Like that? A little more. That? Little more. Something like this? Mm, more. Little more. This? Perfect. Enjoy it while it lasts, Pesto. Soon, they'll all be coming here. Bob's Burgers. Bob speaking. Um, hello, dear. Yes, I'd like to make a reservation. Oh, uh, actually, that's a good idea. We're gonna be slammed. Uh, what time would you like to come in? Um, at you're-an-idiot o'clock! This is Jimmy Pesto here. Hilarious, Jimmy. Looks like whatever dumb idea you had to outdo me really paid off. Not! My idea will pay off, Jimmy! Oh, really? You have no idea what's coming your way. Here's what's coming your way. Hey, hang that up for me, would you? Stupid Pesto! How much longer till halftime? My contractions are nine minutes apart! Just go to the bathroom, Gene. You made it all the way to Sunday. It's still heroic. You just don't understand the pageantry of the Super Bowel. Oh, my God, it's almost kickoff. Our commercial is gonna air any minute. Oh, God! I'm so excited. I can't wait to see it, Bobby. Hey, we're on! I'm already addicted to fame! And carbs. Now I'll be recognized for something other than wearing my shirt backwards at school that one time. At Bob's Burgers, we only use the freshest ingredients, and we grind our meat right here. Mmm. That's a ten-yard penalty for unnecessary deliciousness. Hey, you're NFL great Sandy Can-Can Frye. And you're Bob. Come see me here after the Super Bowl. He'll give you the best burger you've ever had, and I'll give you a high five. Tell me, Sandy. Why do you like Bob's Burgers so much? Because Bob's Burgers goes great with Frye. Bob's Burgers, conveniently located on Ocean Avenue. Open Monday through ""Frye"" day. Also Saturday and Sunday. Can-can! Wow! That turned out great! But the family was barely in it! You didn't even show my hair flip. And where was the Giant Burger Boy who pees mustard? The star of the commercial! You cut out all of the singing! All of it! I to you! Dad threw us under the bus! Hey, I understand you're all disappointed, but Randy and I thought this was the best way to go, and Sandy is so great and likeable that Dah. Is this what you wanted, Dad? All you had to do was ask! Yeah, Dad. Happy now? No. I mean, yes, about our commercial. But no, no. Get used to it, Dad! This is all we can-can do from now on! Yeah Bob! Oh, yeah? Well, this is what's going to get us customers! How long are we going to can-can? 'Cause this is hurting. It doesn't end! You do it till you die! Yeah! Ow! Ow! Hey, look. Sandy is still on TV! What? So, Sandy Frye, why will you be at Jimmy Pesto's signing autographs during and after the Super Bowl? You know, instead of at some stupid greasy burger shack? Because Jimmy Pesto's pizza goes great with Frye. All right. What the hell?! That doesn't even make sense! Pizza doesn't go well with Frye! I don't believe it. Pesto stole our commercial. We're sunk. He beat us again! Who's us? The family you turned your back on? Yeah, now you know how we feel, Bob. The betrayer is betrayed. Karma's a bitch, and then you die. I'm so upset I don't even have to go to the bathroom anymore. Either that, or maybe I'm going right now. Oh, I really do still have to go quite a bit. What are you doing? I'm gonna go settle up with Pesto! God. I can't get this apron off! Stop. You're like a mental patient in a straitjacket. Tina, untie the back! Karma's a bitch. Oh, my God! Forget it! I'll wear it over there! Ah, great commercial, Bob. I'm being sarcastic. It was terrible. Ta You you never support me! Mm. Randy! Mm! I always watch the game here, Bob! You! Down in front! Yeah! Down in front, Front Butt! Yeah, you make a better door than a window, and you're fat! Classic. You stole my commercial, Jimmy! You stole him! Oh, hey, Bob! Pizza? No, I don't want pizza! I'm angry at you! Oh, because of the commercial? Yes! Sandy, how could you? Before you reject my olive branch, which is pizza with olives, let me explain. After I finished shooting your commercial, I came here to get some imaginative appetizers and some pizza two things you don't serve and I may have told Jimmy Pesto that I'm an actor now and I had just shot a commercial with you to air during the Super Bowl. Which, in hindsight, is probably how Jimmy got the idea to do one himself. With the same tag line. But I hired you first! If I hurt your feelings, or broke a contract with you, that was an honest mistake. Live and learn. Yeah, Bob. Live and learn, and lose. Again! All right, that's it! Unplug! Unplug! No, not my satellites! Stay calm, everyone. I'll have 'em back on in a second. Hey, that's that guy from that commercial! Oh, good. You saw my commercial. You copied Pesto! What?! No! I did it first! Pesto copied me! Cry-baby copycat! Cry-baby copycat! No! The commercial with Sandy was my idea! And Jimmy Pesto stole it! Stop throwing food at me! Wow, it's getting physical over there. Let's just remember him as he was and move on. Well, can't leave him there. Come on, let's go get him. Fine. Wait. Let's let him get hit by one more meatball. There it is. Okay, let's go. I'd go with you, but I don't want to give up my seat. It's a good spot. Nah! Stop it! Nah Ow! This guy, am I right? Anyway, would you like to see an outtake from our family commercial? Uh sure? Mm. Did I wow you? I guess. Yes. Ow! Come on! Oh, my God. None of this ever should have happened. I-I made a great commercial with my family. It was funny and cute. Well, it wasn't that funny, but it was good. Well, it wasn't that good, but but it was us. And I scrapped it to make a commercial I thought would get more customers. I never should have done that. Ha-ha, 59%, folks! Thank you, Sandy. Oh, no, I was just responding to the 59%. Don't No! No! Don't clap for that! Listen! Listen to me! I-I made a terrible commercial, but my food's good. You should try it someday. They're back on! They're back on! The TVs are on, everybody! Ha, ha! The game! All right! Now, you, get out of here! Go stand on your own counter; It's already dirty. Yeah, Bobby, let's go. Linda! Kids! We heard every word, Bob. That was beautiful. Took you a while to get there, but you finally realized I was right. As always. That was just so moving. Speaking of moving, I think my butt water broke! I'll be right back. Don't go! Gene, wait. Thought you were leaving. We're going to. Gene just had to use your stupid bathroom. It's for customers only! Can I get a Pesto Colada? Lin! What? I'm sorry I couldn't hold you until halftime. If I did, I can only imagine you'd be an even more Super Bowel. We'll try it again next year. Good-bye, handsome. You look like a fighter. I hope you go down. I kept flushing! I kept flushing! Oh, my God! You kept flushing what? What happened? What-what happened? He's a fighter. He's a fighter. We have to move. Gene's super bowel. Oh, you kept flushing the toilet. Oh, no. Aah, gross! Ew! Oh, my God! Go! Save yourselves! Just remember me! Tell them what happened today! My heart will go on! Oh, hey, there's my commercial for Tran's Noodles. 'Cause Tran's Noodles go great with Frye. I was in a lot of commercials today. Oh, my God, they're all leaving Pesto's! They'll have to come to us! We'll be packed! Well, three people. Ha! Three people, Jimmy! Yeah!  Our food is great  Our staff's full of surprises   So come on down to Bob's  For some burgers and some frieses   Come meet our family  That's us!  And let us meat you  With these!  Come meet our family  That's us!  And let us meat you  With these! Bob's Burgers has the biggest flavor in all the land! Bah! Bah! Bah! The flavor's so big!  Come meet our family  That's us!  And let us meat you  Meat me!  Come meet our family  That's us!  And let us meat you  Meat me!  Bob's Burgers. Bob's Burgers conveniently located on Ocean Avenue. Open Monday through"
"""Why I Love Wagstaff."" That's the theme? Wasn't it ""I Love Wagstaff, Here's Why"" last year? Come on, it's cute. ""Because Andy goes here."" ""Because Ollie goes here."" Where are our kids' projects? We've been around the whole cafeteria. There's Mr. Frond. Let's ask him where the kids' stuff is. Mr. Frond! Is he trying to hide? Hi, Miss La Bonz. Sorry, uh, Mr. Frond is right behind you hiding. Oh, happens every day. Frond, are you avoiding us? No! What? No. I'm in-voiding you. Why is your lip all sweaty? Uh, uh, what? No, just Okay, stop it. Where are our kids' projects? We can't find them. Uh, they are, um they're right there. You didn't point at anything. When you say ""right there,"" you kind of have to point at something. Oh, I-I meant they're right there-there. Frond, stop. Just tell us where they are. Fine. Your children's essays were a little creative. But I thought they were supposed to be creative. Too creative. Too creative! I like the sound of that, huh? Offensive. They were offensive. The school superintendent is here, and I'm already on thin ice with her because my ""credentials"" aren't ""valid"" in this ""state."" Come on, Mr. Frond, how bad can they be? They're kids' stories. I mean, come on. This bad. Ooh! Let me see that. ""The following story is top secret."" If you love Wagstaff like I do, then you need to know the truth. Once you know, you can never un-know. It all started last week while I was sitting in class. Not two miles away, the worst evil this world has ever seen had just traveled here. Nude! Clothing match negative. Whoa, cool yarn! Clothing match good enough. Remain calm. Remain calm. No! No! Remain calm. Remain calm. You sent me from the future to help you in this time, to deactivate the student known as Louise Belcher. What?! Ow! Bad hug, bad hug! Child called Louise Belcher I'm on my break. Whoa. Are you a super strong robot from the future? Wait, don't answer that. That's rhetorical. I got to split. Louise! Calm down. It's me, Darryl. Come with me if you want to continue to be alive. Wait. Why do you look like that? Because I'm from the future. Do they not have razors in the future? Because that mustache is not okay. Really? You don't think it looks cool? Uh, nope. Louise, listen, the Frond that's chasing us is a robot from the future built by the real Frond and sent back to destroy you. No doy. I got that already. I sort of figured this would happen at some point in my life. Quick! In here! I'm dodging for two. Hey, Louise! Hey, weird future Darryl! So, what did I do to him in the future, anyway? It all happened on the day of your eighth grade graduation.  The bombs bursting in air  Hmm? Aah! Hmm? The brownie chair surprise! I actually did it! Yes. And from that day forward, Frond was never the same. He quit his counseling job and boarded himself up in his basement, working day and night on both a time machine and a robot that he could send back in time. Last week, he succeeded. How did you find out? Because I'm also working on a time machine, and we go on a lot of the same message boards. So you used your time machine to get here? No. I had to use his. Mine doesn't work and it starts fires. So you came back through time just to tell me this? Just to be a narrator? And you didn't bring any special weapons or anything? Just a bucket load of exposition and a stupid mustache?! Do you know what, Louise? At this point, if I had any special weapons, I'd use them on you! But you don't, right? I mean, just to clarify, Darryl. Just to check that box. There he is! Here comes the sweaty- Belcher-belly special! Ha! Louise! What? It was funny. We got to run! Grab the rope! Ah Run, Gene! Hey, guys, I know we're running from Mr. Frond for some reason, and though I'm totally willing to go along with it, a little lunch would really hit the spot. Small bits of pork throughout the day is what they say. Actually Maybe someone will drop some food. Come on, creamed corn! Hey, guys, - can I sit with you? - Oh, fine. So, how's your day? Not great. Yeah, me, too. Why? Wh-What's happening? Yeah, no, I'll be fine. I-I, like brought the wrong book to school. Whoa! Mr. Frond! You've been working on your fitness, girl! We need more creamed corn! I know! That's what I've been saying! Run to the kitchen! I'll deactivate all of you. Mr. Frond, your skin burned off. We made you a get-well card. It's a banana peel. - This kitchen is so shiny! - Gene! Over here! Hey, Frond! Let's do lunch. Ah, finally, something fun happened at school. Kids, one; Future Frond, zero. Hmm? Uh aw, crap. So, now we're here, living off the grid in Mexico, or someplace, planning, waiting for when they find us. I'm gonna take a nap under a warm tortilla and then eat my way out when I wake up. I've heard of a power nap, but a flour nap? 'Cause tortillas are made of flour. He's under a tortilla. If you're reading this What? Oh, no, I'm not talking to you. I'm writing in my journal. Oh. 'Cause I I can hear you. Yeah, I say it out loud, and then if it sounds good, I write it down. Well, I'm kind of trying to sleep under a tortilla, so You know what? I am sick of being on this beach with you! Okay, then go a little bit down the beach! And by the way, we're in Belize. It says it right on my hat! ""Un-Belize-able""! We got them at a garage sale! Yes! But it was just a mile away! ""If you're reading this, then there is still a chance ""for mankind, and more importantly a chance ""for a really great moment when everyone will think Mr. Frond pooped his pants."" Well, I loved it. Yeah, it was good. I mean, it was a little some of the references I felt were a little But whatever. Okay, okay, I can see that I'm not getting through to you two. But take a look at this. Okay, Bobby, you read this one. This time, I just want to listen and get carried away with the story. Just want to close my eyes and listen to the story. Okay, fine. Okay. Read it out loud. ""Fart School for the Gifted."" ""It was lunchtime at Fart School for the Gifted"" I love it already! the coolest school in the world, And we were all jamming to my new song, ""Gas Class.""  Gas class!   You wanna pass gas class?   You gotta pass gas  But then uncool counselor Mr. Frond decided to be a total ding-dong. All right, that's it. I know this is Fart School for the Gifted, but this is not a place for dancing or singing! Whoa, nice song, Moz-fart! That wasn't me. I-I didn't fart. If you liked that fart sound, wait till you hear this one! I've been working on it all year. It'll literally blow the roof off of the school! Aah! Give it! Give! Until you prove that you can behave better, I'm confiscating your keyboard. Where are you taking him?! To my office! I mean, to somewhere you've never heard of. Not my office. No! I'll just follow him and find out. Aw! Can't believe it! Mr. Frond is probably tickling the ivories. And they're probably laughing, because they don't know any better. Well, there's nothing we can do. Sounds like you aren't getting that keyboard back until you learn to behave better. Or plan ""B"": We get it back by behaving worse. Keep talking. Uh-oh, I'm listening to music on a portable tape player, and it's making me very curious about sex. No, no, no, no. No curiosity in the halls. I'll need my lock-picking kit. No, you won't. I've got mine right  Here  Hmm? We've got to get to the P.A. system. But they already did the morning announcements. Remember? Jody had a birthday, and the canned food drive is going great. That is all. That is not all. I have a special announcement. Aah. Aah! And turn. Hey, uh, there's a Brendan Fraser DVD just sitting in a bush outside. Oh. Mine, mine. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. You come out of there right now. Oh, I'm not coming out but this is.    When you feel like school   Has sucked the wind out of your sails   Remember that it's cool   To use the wind that's in your tails   Fart, fart, fart   Fart, fart, fart, fart   Every fart is a work of art   Don't know where to begin? Don't know where to start?   Farts will set you free   It's that gas from your ass, it's that toot from your boot   That hum from your bum, it's that loot in your chute   All that air from your own derriere   Come on and set it free   'Cause farts are liberty  What do we want to do? Fart, fart! Open up your butt cheeks. This is how our butts speak. Let's go Fart!

'Cause farts will set you   Free!  The end. Are you crying? Oh, it's so beautiful. His farts set them free. He's a hero. Don't you get it? A hero? He wants to destroy the school with farts. Oh, come on. It was pretty ambiguous, Frond. I think he wanted the reader to decide if the fart destroyed the school. Well, it was it was still gross. Oh, it was beautiful. And speaking of gross. Heh. ""Tina Belcher's Erotic Friend Fiction presents: A Tale of Horror."" I'm Tina Belcher. I love Wagstaff. I love it so much that I became the volunteer sheriff. Okay, I mean hall monitor, But that's like the sheriff of the hall. Something felt off that morning. I could feel it in my bones. My arm bones, my leg bones. All the bones. Aah. Hey, Tina, let me in.

Oh, no, the jock itch vaccine must've turned the players into zombies. We spent so much time asking if we could cure jock itch, we never asked if we should cure jock itch. Aah. Aah! Guys, this way. We'll be safest in the teacher's lounge. It's the only door on school property that locks. Plus you can smoke in there, in case anyone is feeling stressed out. No judgment. Oh, no, it's locked. What? Is somebody in there? No. Mr. Frond, you have to let us in. The zombie JV basketball team is right behind us. You know, I I'd love to, but, uh my This  won't budge. Mr. Frond, open the door. No. You can't leave us all out here to get infected. We're just kids. Ow! The door hurt my knuckles. All right, look, let me explain. I have to keep myself safe so I can guide those who survive. They're gonna need me. - Makes sense. - Mr. Frond, there's a You just stay in there. Keep yourself safe. You're so important. We'll be fine. - Yes, I think that's b - aah!

"Click. Click. Click, click. - Louise, stop saying click. - Click. Click. And, Tina, will you stop typing like that? I'm refreshing my e-mail. I'm waiting for an invitation to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah. I believe the term is badminton. Common mistake. No, Gene. Tammy's Jewish. It's a ceremony where she reads from the Torah, lights a candle and becomes a woman. Sounds like my spa night. Except I read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. You know a lot about Bat Mitzvahs for someone who thought Chanukah was Han Solo and Chewbacca's baby. It's about becoming a woman and it's a really great party. Why wouldn't I research that? Plus, rumor has it this one's gonna be packed with B-FOS. What are B-FOS? B-F-O-S. Boys From Other Schools. What's wrong with the boys from your school? I need fresh faces. And fresh butts. You'll take the butts you're given and you'll like it! Don't you dare call back until it's done! Do you understand me? Okay, bye, Mom. Hi, Tammy. Tina, I am up to my pits in Bat Mitzvah planning. Mm-hmm. But I figured out the theme, which is ""Tammy""! Me, it just makes sense. Nice. You get an ""O"" for original. And for O-M-G I didn't get an invite to your Bat Mitzvah. Mm, that's 'cause I didn't invite you. Oh. That ""O"" doesn't stand for anything. It's just me being surprised. I was really looking forward to all those B-FOS. Mm, me too. Yeah, a lot of B-FOS. I got Hebrew School B-FOS. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I got Camp B-FOS. I got B-FOS who are Filipinos. Fili-B-FOS. Got your invite, Tammy. We'll be there. Bat Mitzvah, baby! Hava Nagiddiyup! Giddyap, boy! Ow! Get! Giddyap! Ow! Ow! Yeah! Well, if a spot opens up, keep me in mind. Spots are for underwear, Tina. Not my Bat Mitzvah. Got to run! Tina, that's the third time you sighed on my sandwich. You're heating up the bread. It just seems like everyone's going to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah but me. But you got to go to Shauna's Bat Mitzvah. Shauna had a Bat Mitzvah? Oh! Uh No! Mom! Shauna Glassman had five caterers at her Bat Mitzvah and everyone talked about how great that was. So, we need six caterers. Find me another caterer or I'm gonna find another mom! Excuse me, Tammy? I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. If you need another caterer for your Bat Mitzvah, my dad can do it. We help him with catering jobs all the time. No, no, we can't do that. What does he do again? Nothing. No Burgers. Can he do sliders? 'Cause I want slider burgers. Oh, no, he's terrible at sliders. He can do sliders. No, he He can make them as small as you want. Oh He has a real He can make them so small you can't even see them. No. I'm eating one right now. Fine. He's hired, he's hired. No! Oh, okay. We'll be there! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just have your parents call my parents. I got to take this. What is it now, Rabbi Rosenberg? What is it now? Yes! Great! Now we all have to go to that ""Brat"" Mitzvah. Have fun explaining this to Dad! I'm sure Dad will love it. No way. Dad, you have to! No I don't, Tina. I-I don't like catering. You guys always wander off and leave me with all the work. Dad, this is the only way I get to go to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah! Tina, this isn't going to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah. It's working at it. Won't it be awkward for you with all your friends there as guests? You don't understand! This is my way in! She's having B-FOS from all around the world! All right, calm down. That's it. Get all the blood to your head. Let it flow. Does it really mean that much to you? - Yes! Look at my face! - Oh, my God. Aah! One luftballon! Okay, get her up, get her up! I don't know. We won't leave you alone this time, Bobby. Right, guys? Eh. Soft maybe. Please, Dad? Fine. We'll do it. Yay! All right! Now can I get circumcised? Gene. I know some people. Look at all this food. It's like we died and went to fancy mall food court heaven. That is the creepiest thing I've ever seen. I think it's nice. Two mini burgers, please. Hey, Jimmy Jr. Zeke. What's it like out there? So sweet. They even have a DJ in the bathroom. I was dancing so hard I forgot why I went in there. Wow. I've had not one, not two, but three Tammy-tinis! I'm waiting for the sugar to hit me! Here I go, oh! Here he goes. It's gonna happen. It's coming! Here we go. Kaboom! Nice! I'm hyper. Officially hyper. Wow, sounds grea Hey, can we get those mini burgers? They're taking a long time. Oh, right. Hurry up, T-town. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the star of the evening. Tammy!  She's Tammy, she's glammy   She's just a little hammy   If she sang a song right now   She'd probably win a Grammy   You know who I'm talking of   So why don't you all say mazel tov   Tammy, yeah.  Hey, everyone! Mazel tov to me! Mazel tov! Tina, is this Tammy-tastrophe everything you dreamed it would be? I wish I was more in the mix. From here, I can only look at the B-FOS, but not touch. You could probably touch them. You think so? Yeah. No, I can't. Aw, I have bad depth perception, sorry. What's going on here? Where are the Tammy toothpicks? Tammy what? All of the food is supposed to have toothpicks with my face on top. Janet, what's happening? Here are your toothpicks. And here's your headset. You didn't give them a headset either? God, Janet! What's this for? So Janet can stay in contact with all the caterers. Duh. Why would we need to stay in contact? Hello?! The toothpicks? That was almost a major disaster. Uh, you're kind of exaggerating, Tammy. I'm exaggerating? Yeah, I think so. A little bit. That is literally the stupidest thing that anyone has ever said in the history of mankind. Ever! You're having a hard day, I think. I'm having the best day of my life. It's my Bat Mitzvah. You're a wonderful little girl. Thank you. What a 'tude. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. During the walk there and back, it'll be like I'm at the party. Great, now we lost Tina. No one else is allowed to leave. Janet, we're out of ranch dressing! Um I-I If a chicken tender touches my lips without ranch dressing I am literally going to kill someone! I'm not wearing this. I'll take that. Bat Zilla. Oh, no. Who said that? Janet, are you listening to me? Bat Zilla's angry, Janet. What are you gonna do? Uh, please, if this could just, uh, I've got two and half me hours? Bat Zilla's gonna kill you in under two. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. Janet, you got to get out of this. Please help, please help! You're better than this! Janet, you know you can do better! Who are you? The voice in your head, Janet. Ah, no big deal. Just the single greatest collection of food ever assembled under one roof. Not gonna wander off. Nah, good Linda. Stay right here. The crepes smell good. The crepes smell real good! Don't know you, don't know you. Janet! What's wrong with Tammy's eye? Uh, that one's a little bigger than that one. Not me! Her! Uh, uh I need someone to fix the bulb on the Tammy head stat. Janet, you got to get out of here. I do, I do. What are you doing here still, Janet? What are your dreams? I know you've got dreams. I'm gonna move to New York. You should go there, Janet. And I'm gonna sing and dance! Give me some of that singing. Give it to me now, Janet.  Start sp  Wake up, Janet! Wake up. You wake up, Tammy. 'Cause guess what? I quit! What?! Oh, how the tides have turned, Tammy! Janet, don't you dare. Oh, look at me. The headset's a-coming off of the ears! Janet, don't you take that ear headset off! I can't hear you anymore! Janet! Look I respond to nothing, Tammy! Janet! Janet! Nothing but my own desire to be a star! Janet! Oh, voice, voice, you've taught me well. Janet! You're welcome, Janet. Excuse me, Tammy? This might not be the best time but can you tell me where the ladies' room is? Not now, Tina! Wait, how good are you with a clipboard? I'm okay. Sometimes I get my fingers caught in the clip thing. Here, you're my new coordinator. I am? Yeah. You wanted to be at the party now you're running the party. Okay, I'll do the First, the schedule's on the clipboard. We have to stick to it no matter what. Got it? Check. See all those people? Those are my relatives. We're not close and they all have old person face. So it's your job to tell me who's who. How will I know who's? There's a Tammy's family cheat sheet on the clipboard. Oh, okay. And that's Justin. He's the cutest guy in Hebrew school. Remember that punim, okay? That means ""face"" in old Jewish language. Justin. The ladies choice dance is at 9:30. And by ladies, I mean me. I'm choosing Justin as my dance partner. That makes sense. And that'll lead right into the hora, which is when I get lifted into a chair and I feel like a Jewish movie star, like Whoopi Goldberg. Would it be okay if I went to the bathroom really fast? Never mind, I-I'll hold it. I'll make it go away. You do that. Tina, did you just get bat-bullied into being a party planner? Louise? This line is for work only. Why do you want to be the new Janet? Well, at least I'm not stuck behind the burger station. Tina, I've got a wedgie and I'm not gonna pick it at my own party! Janet had small fingers! Got to go. Hmm. Hello, guac. Let's take a little walk. Uh, where's Louise? Did we lose her, too? She's on the Mexican food, Chinese food border. It's a war zone! I'll go see if she needs backup. No. Oh, boo. Bobby, I'm getting light-headed, I need some air. Lin, you're not light-headed. You want a crepe. You've been saying crepe under your breath for ten minutes. What?! Crepe. There's crepes here? Crepe. You're doing it. I am not! Don't be ridiculous! Crepe. You just did it. Crepe. What?! Oh, my God. I didn't do nothing. Just go. I told you, I'm light-headed. Just go. Crepe, crepe, crepe. Go. Crepe, crepe, crepe, crepe, cr I'll be, I'll be right back! Mm-hmm. Crepe! Crepe! Wait for me, Mom! Why aren't I moving? I will not be left alone. But Mom said she'd be right back! Gene, look at me. You and I both know your mom's not coming back after just one crepe. She's not gonna stop, Gene. She's never gonna stop. It's who she is. If she stops, she'll die. Like a crepe shark. Gene? Yes. We need to stick together. I'm gonna grill and you're gonna plate. Dad, I never realized how soulful your eyes are. Gene. Wait, really? Aunt Frida from Florida. She had hip-replacement surgery last year. Aunt Frida! Your new hip looks hot. Tammy, I'm so proud of you on your big day. We got a clinger! Tina. Let go of Tammy. Those are your parents. I know who my parents are, Tina. Are you having fun, honey? Mom, You got your weird perfume on me! I got to go swab this off. Tina, make sure we stay on schedule. Okay. It's not weird. You like it, right? Um, yeah, I like it. I wear it. It's bisexual. Do you mean unisex? It's the same thing. It is not the same thing. My swim-aerobics instructor is bisexual. Thank you, Frida. What? This shouldn't be open! Looks like you got a runny nose, Tammy. What are you doing in my head? Whoops. Hey, Tammy! Good to see you there. I thought the tortilla chips were in here. Which is like, so creative. But I guess not. You were going to pour guacamole out of my nose like boogers, weren't you?! Oh, my God, Tammy, that's hilarious. Let's do it! Stop it! What's going on? I think we're going up! God, it won't open! No! Hello! I'm in here! Help us! I'm in here! It's Tammy the Bat Mitzvah girl! No one can hear us over the terrible band! The Klezbians are not a terrible band! Yes, they are! How dare you! Oh, help! Hello! No! I'm in here! Oops! Gene, easy. That's the fifth burger you've dropped on the floor. - That you know of - Have you guys seen Tammy? Oh, good. You're back. No, I'm not back, I'm the new Janet. I'm really busy. Tammy's supposed to lead off the limbo soon and I can't find her anywhere. I haven't seen her in a while, and I have to say, I have enjoyed every minute of our time apart. Have you seen your mother or Louise? We don't need them! Oops! Mom's over by the Italian food station. Hi! Mm. You gotta try this! I-I mean, I'll be right back! Mm. I gotta find Tammy. We gotta stay on schedule no matter what. Ugh. We're out of napkins. I'll go. I don't know what they're for, but I'll get 'em. No. No. Gene, you stay here. I'll go. Help! The headset's clogged. Um, who cares about that right now? You should, Tammy, because the headset was our only way of communicating with the outside world. Now I'm gonna die in here and they're gonna find my bones in your head. This wasn't the head I wanted them to find my bones in! Hello! It's me, Tammy! The star of the Bat Mitzvah! Okay. Let's do what I came here to do. You are not pouring guacamole out of my nose. If I pour the guacamole, it might fall on someone and they'll look up and see us. Ugh. Fine. No no, no! Why isn't it falling? Because of your big mouth, Tammy! Someone's gotta notice I'm missing. This is my party. The theme is me. What are you planning to do with this stupid head after today anyway? Um, hello? I'm gonna donate it to charity. I do thihink about other people. Gnocchi. Looks good. Maybe I'll just try one. Mmm. That's really good. Okeydokey, gnocchi. I'm sorry I just said that. Out loud. To myself. Uh my dad said he'd be right back. He's getting napkins, whatever that is! In the meantime, is anyone here for just a plain bun? Mr. and Mrs. Larson, I can't find Tammy and we're supposed to do the limbo in two minutes. Hi, Other Janet. Sometimes when Tammy gets like this we just let her take some time by herself. We call it Tammy time. But Tammy time isn't on the schedule. Other Janet's moving her mouth but all I hear is, ""We-wah we-wah."" Ow. What? Be a man. You be a man. It's time for the limbo! Somebody's gotta kick this thing off. I guess it's gotta be me. How low can you go? Not that low. Still too low. Yeah, a little higher. Mm, one more inch? Well, you'll walk right under it now! Yeah, but just in case, a little higher. Okay, everybody, let's limbo! What the hell is your sister doing? Looks like the limbo. Or some awkward version of it. I was supposed to lead off the limbo. I was the one who went to limbo boot camp! Limbo, check. Next on the schedule is the conga line. Gotta stay on schedule no matter what. Whoops. Bob! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm eating this dumpling. Yeah, the food here is really good. They hired great caterers for this, right? Yeah, except for us sneaking off like a couple of Shirky Shirleys. No, no, no, it's okay. Uh, Gene is running the ship over there, so we're fine. Over where? Where-where is he? Over, uh, there, see? Behind the uh, you can't see from here. Where are we? Yeah. We are not in the same hall as we were a minute ago. It's like the end of The Shining in here. We could get lost. Where did everybody go? Wait a minute, this is a wedding! Hey, boys. It's time for the conga line. Grab on and let's go. Oh, hey, okay. I could get used to being Tammy. Look out for that wall! I got it! Tina hijacked my conga line! I want my conga! Looks like they're doing fine without you. Are you kidding? She's all over the road! It's da-da-da-da da-da. It's not supposed to be like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Guess what? No, you guess what. When we get out of here, Tina is so fired. I'll have my Bat Mitzvah back and your lame sister can conga her butt outta here. You owe me one, Tina. You know what, I can't fix this thing. Looks like you won't be getting your party back for a while. It's just you and me, Tam-tam. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back. Excuse me, but there's no break on the schedule. Uh, I gotta call my dog sitter. But it's time for me to lead the Macarena. So, hey, Macarena or hey, you're fired.  Hamotzi lechem min ha'aretz.  Tammy's taking Tammy time. I'm filling in. Take it.  Amen.  It's been almost two hours. No one even notices that I'm not there. Wow. This is like a reverse It's a Wonderful Life. You get toee how much better off everyone is without you shrieking at them. Yeah. Okay, okay, easy there, ugh. Everyone is having a good time without me. It's true. I was being A horrible Bat Zilla? Yeah. Like, the worst person alive? Just like, a crazy monster? Yeah! All right, there you go. Coming around. Hey. Hey. Hey. Look at this! Tammy! What? I fixed the headset. What? I fixed the headset. Oh. Oh! You're a genius! I know. Well, what are you waiting for? Get us out of here! Oh, it's broken! No! Okay, I fixed it, I fixed it. But you watch your tone. I'm sorry. And you better start inviting my sister to all your dumb parties. I can't give you a guarantee. All right, then it's broken. No! Come on! Keep up! What part of the chicken dance don't you understand? Tina, you're kind of getting an attitude. Hmm. Let me check the schedule for mouthing off to the party planner. No. Not on here. So zip your lips and shake your hips. Tina! Tina, can you hear me? Louise? Oh, Tina! Hey, hey! Where are you? I'm stuck inside Tammy's head! Yeah. This whole thing is just too much Tammy. No! I'm literally stuck inside Tammy's giant head. With Tammy! Get us out of here! Huh? How did you guys get up there? Are those boogers? That's funny. Thank you. Can you just get us down? Okay, I'll get the maintenance guy to ""Ladies choice dance with Justin."" What? Oh, I mean, it's just that next on the schedule is ladies choice - dancing with Justin. - So? - And if we want to stay on schedule - No, no, no, no. I probably should keep filling in for Tammy. It's what she would've wanted. No! Tina! Get us out of here right now! I want my Bat Mitzvah back! Um Uh-oh, you guys are starting to break up. I can't hear you. You're terrible at making static sounds, Tina. Get us down! Give me back my party, you psycho! I'm losing you guys. I'm not a psycho. Tina, don't do th Hi, Aunt Frida. Hi, Other Tammy. Your single white female sister is out of control! What do we do? I don't know, Tammy, I hate her, too! Plan B. And what is that? Going back to your plan A. Jump till this thing breaks open! Go! You got it! Oh, my little legs! Justin, it's time for your ladies choice dance with Tammy. But since she's still taking Tammy time, we found you another partner and it is me. Um, but Can't talk there's a schedule. Hey! This burger isn't cooked! You want this food cooked, you go put it in a sink and run it under hot water. All right. Good! I don't have time to run all this food under hot water. Who's next? It's time for the Bat Mitzvah lady and the gentleman of her choice to take the dance floor. That's us. What's Tina doing out there? Becoming a woman. Oh. The hand wants what the hand wants. I can't tell where your back ends and your butt begins. Oh, there it is. I was just too high. That's my song! She's doing my dance! Oh, my God! Lower the Tammy head! Uh-oh. We've been looking for you! Honey, are you okay? Hold on. Hold on, let me put down my drink. You! Justin, what are you doing? I'm not Tammy! Get my hands off your upper butt. The ball is over, Fake-erella. Tina, what the hell? I was stuck in there with that and you did nothing! Why didn't you rescue us? Um, I guess I got a little swept up in my role. Yeah, you think?! The power of the Bat Mitzvah is intoxicating. It's like a religious experience. Tammy, they don't get it. But I do. We do. I guess we do. Thanks for coming to my Bat Mitzvah. Um Time for the hora, everyone! The hora! The hora! This isn't over, Tina! Oh, my God. See, this is what happens when we cater. We better get out of here before we get chased out. Let's go back to the wedding. Ooh, I want to sign the guest book. Sorry we left you, Gene. I'm not! It was easy. You make it seem so difficult. Once you stop using the grill, it's fast. For my Bat Mitzvah, I just want a gift certificate. Louise, you're not getting a Bat Mitzvah. I know. Because I'm getting a gift certificate.

That for here or to go? Um, for delivery? Delivery? But you're here. Just make the sandwiches, Reggie. Okay, I-I'm making it, making the sandwiches. It's okay. Here we go. Here we go. Hey, Jonas, you got another delivery. Mm, mm, mm. Jonas. Cool keyboard. My brother uses his to make fart sounds. It's not a keyboard. It's a melodica. But, hey, why am I talking about it, when I could be doing this? Well, get a melod-a-you. See ya. Back at my house! That's where your next delivery is. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. If I'm delivering this to your house, why don't you just hop on? That's a good idea that I never thought of until you just said it. It's happening. You don't have to hold me so tight. Oh, this isn't tight. I'm so hungry, I'm so hungry. Food's here! And, Teddy, I don't know if this will interest you, but Tina is riding on a death machine with a stranger. Tina, what are you doing on the back of a motorbike? It's okay. I wore a helmet. Right, but still. Just seems like it's a gray area between bicycle and motorcycle. - I don't know how I should react. - Ground her. And give me all of her stuff. Next time, put a helmet on the food. My sandwich top is askew! Askew! Well, come on up soon, Tina. It's dinnertime. Psh, cool dad. Oh, thanks, but he's not my dad. He's a regular in our restaurant, and he's watching us for the weekend 'cause my parents are out of town. Wait, wait, wait. Your parents are out of town and you've got your very own restaurant? You're a really good listener. We should have a gathering here. Tonight. We should? Uh, of course we should. I don't think I'm allowed to have a party. It's a gathering. Where like-minded young adults come together and just gather, you know? I guess I know. I'll be there, right? That's not too bad, right? Uh-huh. I'll bring my hair. Yeah. Okay. I punch out in an hour. And I'll tell my friends to swing by. Um, okay. Hey, you good at catching things? Not really. Well, get good, so you can catch this. Caught it. No, wait, I think I dropped it. See ya! Damn it. Won't start. Don't look at me. I'll try not to. No promises. You know, these people are more than just online usernames that I share burger tips with. It's a community. They're my people. Okay, save it for your friends, honey. Hey, Beefgeek. You look exactly like I thought you would. Meatcute! There she is! Oh, not a hugger. That's fine. So here we are, finally getting together in person. Party started! You know what we should do? Shots! I'll get 'em! Don't let him ruin your weekend. No, no, I'm gonna say something. Hey! BeeferSutherland, it's me, BurgerBob! So where's your oversized luggage? What? What-what are you talking about? Because you must have needed the world's biggest suitcase to lug your gigantic balls here. Beefer, I'm totally lost here. I'm saying it took big balls to show up at this conference. Big balls! Big balls? I-I don't have those. Why wouldn't I show up here? Maybe because all your posts are either crapping on us amateurs or you're bragging about your flashy restaurant. That's crazy. I-I don't I don't do that. Mm-hmm. I asked how to get rust off a cast-iron skillet. And you say, ""Don't let it get rust in the first place."" All caps! What a jerk. I was just kidding around. Then why didn't you write ""LOL"" or ""JK"" or use an emoticon? Oh, I-I don't know how to use those things. Oh, come on! And trust me, my-my restaurant isn't flashy. We've got a funeral home on one side of us and I think on the other side is a guy that sells indoor outhouses. I bought one of those! Oh. Why? Because it's cheaper than Never mind. Let's get out of here before BurgerBob yells at us with his caps lock key. Wait, I Blocked. Oh, hey, where'd everyone go? Nobody likes me. Sure, they do. Have a shot. You'll feel better. I don't feel like a shot, Lin. No, do a shot. It makes you more fun. People'll like you. I don't want to do shots. I paid for five shots, we're doing five shots. Go. Wolf it. Ooh, we hooked something big. You smell that? It's vile. Yeah. But so vile you want to suck it into your lungs, right? Ah, you gettin' that? Ah! What is that, sulfur? Is that Satan? It's putting up a fight. Give me a hand here. Ah! It's magnificent. Ah It really is. Tina! We're bonding like crazy in here. Be part of it. Oh, yeah. That's great. So, I'm gonna go down to the restaurant and do some homework. It's Friday night. It's time to party. Grab the bathroom scale let's weigh this thing. Maybe after I knock out this pesky homework, huh? What are you, a bookworm? Huh? Have fun. Who wants to taste it? Me! And then I want to name it and raise it like it's our own. Maybe they won't come. Maybe that's for the best. I really do have homework to do. Hey, little girl, psst. You. It's Tina. Right. Well, uh, come on in. I'm totally comfortable with having you all here. This place is kind of lame, right? Yeah, let's get out of here. Great gathering, Jonas. It's the leaky gazebo all over again. No, wait. Hey. Free burgers isn't lame, right? Um, I'm really not allowed to light the grill by myself. I could go for a cheeseburger. Cheeseburger for Marco, Tina? Huh? Uh Huh? Okay. I'll fire up the grill. Cool, cool. Oh, hey. Did someone order some tunes? I don't think so. An-Anyone order tu Oh, you were just I'm likable. Yeah I know I am! No, you have friends. The kids like me, Teddy likes me. Right, Teddy. Teddy likes you. My dad hates me. Not that again. Uh, what the They just threw an olive at me. You can't get away from my olives. Bobby, screw those burger nerds. Let's go check out the Jacuzzi. It's open till 9:45 That's nice. Isn't it? See? Even if we don't have room service or a fax machine and everyone at the hotel hates you, we can still have a romantic getaway. Oh, no, not you guys. Come on, Beefer, let's just come back later. And let BurgerBob win? No way. I showered and everything. We'll just sit here and wait. Well, you're gonna be waiting a long time, 'cause we're just getting comfy. Myeh, myeh, myeh. Uh, yeah. This Jacuzzi is for members of the Jacuzzi forum only. That's not a thing. You just made that up. No, I didn't. And you are blocked.  Hey  Whoo!  La-la-la-la-la-la-la- la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  A nice thick layer of chocolate squares make up the base. A couple of handfuls of crushed pretzels. Top it all off with marshmallows, and Whoa! Voila! Teddy Brulee. Finally, arson and food together! Hey, Teddy, can I play with that blowtorch? I just want to inspect it, you know, learn about it. Yeah, sure. Here you go. Hold on. You hear that? Nope. Sounds like an accordion but worse? Nope, in your head. Nope, it's something downstairs. No, in your head upstairs. Sorry, folks, private party. Yeah? I-I think we're on the list. Right, Tina? Uh yeah. Tina, Tina, Tina. You're supposed to be the good one. Somewhere there's a convenience store parking lot worried sick about these teens. Tina, come on, you're putting me in a tough spot. I'm sure you're not allowed to have friends down here this late at night. Dude, with that kind of attitude, you're only going to raise your blood pressure to unsafe levels. Don't lecture me about my blood pressure! I'm predisposed to like salty foods. Out! Everybody out of my friend's restaurant! Oh, my God. Teddy, could you embarrass me any more? Oh, that's a great question, and the answer is yes. Please start. Please start. Oh, thank God. Let's just go to the cove. The cove? It's the cove by the lighthouse. Come by if you want. I know that place. It's the cove by the lighthouse. And, uh, hey, if you come, uh, bring some burgers with you? Here's a little one. Got it. Little mouth burger. We just got our goop baby to sleep and we have to come downstairs to deal with this? We are very disappointed. Tina, I have no idea what's gotten into you. You can't stop what's happening. Jonas likes me and he invited me out with his friends, and I want to go! Sorry, Tina. You're 13 years old, it's 9:00, you're in for the night. My temporary house, my temporary rules. You don't like it? There's the door that you can't go out! I hate your temporary rules! Shh-shh-shh- shh-shh. You're not my dad, Teddy. Or my mom. Or my uncle. And I don't think you're my godfather. I don't think I have one. I'm coming, Jonas! You're right, box. The ladder did install in less than 30 seconds. Hey, guys. I made it. Now it's a party. And I brought burgers. Nice! Not from our restaurant, 'cause I couldn't get the key. Hey, that melodica's not gonna play itself. Oh, yeah. No. No. Oh, great. No, no, no Wow, it's almost like music. Belcher residence. Teddy, it's Bob. Wait, I called your cell phone. Why'd you say Belcher residence? Just to be respectful. How's the conference going? Uh, it's complicated. How's it going over there? It's complicated. What? Teddy, I can say it's complicated. You can't say it's complicated. You're watching my kids. Sorry, Bob. So is it complicated, Teddy? No, it's great. You want to talk to the kids? Eh, not really. You sure? No, yeah. I can put 'em on. Yeah, go Yeah, all right. Okay. Louise is asleep. Gene's asleep. And Tina's aah! Asleep. Uh, Tina's asleep, Bobby. All right, well, let her sleep. Okay. We'll talk to them in the morning. All right, well, I'll I'll happily put on Tina if you want to talk to her right now, Bobby. No, it's all right. Let her sleep. I will wake her up with a bucket of water and a cowbell if that's gonna make you happy, Bobby. You want to talk to your daughter, you got it. Teddy. It's okay. Stop. I'm hanging up now. Go to bed. Yeah. Okay. Oh, this is bad. This is terrible! Aah! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Hey, you woke us up. What gives, Teddy? We need our sleep. We're so little. Tina's missing, Louise! More like kissing. You know. Jonas! The sandwich boy. Ugh. The sign says to limit your soak time to 15 minutes! That sign says, ""No running,"" and you're running your mouth, MeatCute! I bought these trunks for this conference. I'm not bringing 'em home dry! They're gonna be damp at the very least. Screw these guys. Let's just get in there with 'em. Like hell you will! Back it up! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy now! Oh, no, you don't. Hey, hey, hey! My wife and I never get a weekend away! Hey, don't touch me. This is all the vacation we have left, and you're not getting it! I'll go right, you go left. Mm-hmm. Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ooh, splashing. Good idea! I know! Ah, excuse me. Excuse me. What is going on here? Stay out of this! Give me that. These people are jabbing us and harassing us. And they've been in there for an hour! An hour? That's crazy. We just got here. Oh, really? Hmm. Pruny. I've had a bad feeling about you two ever since check-in. That's it. Please exit the hot tub so these people may enjoy it. Fine. Okay, we'll leave. Really? Yeah. We're all grown-ups here. Thank you. Bye-bye, BurgerBob. Oh, that jet is right on my back. Oh, that's a lumbar paradise. I trust your conference is going well, otherwise. I'm not completely dissatisfied. Hmm. Huh? Hope you like your Jacuzzi with extra relish! Aah! And mayo! L.O.L. Laugh on loudly! And post. That's it. I'm calling security. Good, we're leaving anyway. Yeah. And get a fax machine. Oh, go fax yourself! Stop. Stop. Stop, Jonas. No one likes that except the girl, and she's probably had enough, right? It's okay, I guess. Stop if you want to stop, though. What about, um Let's break into the lighthouse and, uh, make shadow puppets onto the fog. Eh. Ugh. Well, no one else is coming up with ideas, Marco. I'll break into the lighthouse with you without the melodica. How do we get in? Through that window up there. One of us can go in and then unlock the front door for the rest of us. Terrible plan. Seriously, Clay? Yeah, seriously, Clay? It looks like a tight squeeze. I'll do it. I can fit. Uh, okay, sure. I'll give you a boost. You've got strong arms. Must be from delivering all those sandwiches. Yeah. Uh, can you reach the window? Uh, I have to step on your head. Ow! Ow! Cops! Run! Wait! Jonas, wait for me! Gotcha. All right, come on out! Oh, this isn't my house. What the hell were you doing in the lighthouse, young lady? I was gonna make shadow puppets to amuse the ships at sea? Oh, you think this is funny? Some ship sees a huge dog in the fog?! I don't know how to make a dog! Everybody knows how to make a dog! Oh. Yeah. All right, smart-ass, let's call your parents so they can pick you up. My parents are out of town. Well, looks like you'll be spending the night at the station. Uh, the police station? No, the ranger station. It's the same, but we have a foosball table. Reggie! Reggie! Open up! You can't wait till morning for a nice sandwich? My oldest temporary niece Tina ran off with your delivery boy. I'm not blaming you, but I'm blaming you! Where are they, Reggie? Where are they?! Jonas would sell you out in a hot second! You can't even look us in the eyes! Where are they, Reggie? Well, for a while, him and his friends liked to hang out in my gazebo, but then, one night, it rains, and it leaks a tiny bit, and they wouldn't shut up about it. Like I'm the jerk. Now I think they go to the cove by the lighthouse. Come on, let's go! Wait, I want to see this gazebo. The gazebo that cold cuts built! No, no, no, no, no, we got no time for gazebos. Okay, we'll take a quick look. Go out! I'm dumping sand on you. Go out! Excuse me, Officer. Have you seen a bunch of teenagers around here? They're of the dorky variety. Yup. I apprehended one of them. Tina! Hi, Teddy. Oh, you know this girl? Yes, I do. I'm her weekend guardian. Well, I caught her trespassing in the lighthouse. You got to let her go, Officer. I could do that, or I could let her spend the night behind bars. No, no, no! Li-Listen, Ranger Dainko Is it Ranger Dainko? What's your first name? Matthew. Matthew Dainko. That's a pretty name. Look, I've only been an uncle for a day. I guess I couldn't handle the job. If anyone should spend the night in teen ranger jail, it should be me. It's not teen ranger jail, it's just ranger jail. Look, maybe she didn't do the right thing tonight, but she's got heart, this one, and she follows it. She's just a mixed up kid who's going through a ton of puberty right now. Am I right, Tina? Yes. And then some. Well, it's not that simple. There's a form involved two signatures and an initial. You got to sign here. Okay. And again here. Right. And initial here. Right. Okay. So, just anywhere? No, where it says guardian. So at the bottom? No, on-on the line. So just anywhere on the form? Just write No not on the anywhere. Oh? Just okay, just never mind! Forget it! I was so worried about you, Tina. I'm sorry, Teddy. I shouldn't have snuck out. Thanks for getting me out of ranger danger. I don't think I would have made it in the joint. Jonas, you came back for me! Uh yeah. And this. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't come back for Tina. You came back for your moped. You used Tina for free burgers, then you hung her out to dry when Ranger Matthew Dainko came. Oh, God, you did, didn't you? She's too good for you! But good enough for a lot of guys! Which makes you the worst, Jone-ass! Okay, I'll keep that in mind as I ride away. Oh, no, you don't. Hey! Nobody messes with my temporary niece! Aah! Yeah! No! Oh. Oh, that's bad. Tell you what. Instant regret. I cannot believe I did that. Talk about losing your cool, Teddy. You're gonna have a lot to talk about this week in therapy! Right? Eh. ""Did you lose your cool?"" ""A little bit, doc. A little bit I lost my cool."" Hey, we should call Teddy and let him know we're coming home early. Hello. Teddy. Hey, it's Linda. You're on speakerphone. Hey, Teddy. The conference was a bust. We're coming home early. Oh, goodie. How early is early? Ah, we'll be home in 15 minutes. Okay, great! Your parents are If we hurry, we can beat 'em home and jump in bed and pretend nothing happened. Teddy? Yeah? We just heard everything you said. No, you didn't. I had it on mute. You didn't. No, I-I definitely tried to press it. Wait, wait, wait. Are you at the beach? No. We can see you. That's them right there. That's them. Oh, yeah. Hey, Bobby. What is that kid doing in the water? Rescuing a drowning moped. Oh, God, it's late. Bedtime, kids! Bedtime! Anything you say, Uncle Teddy.  Hey  Whoo!"
"Mmm Mmm You gotta wrap it up, Teddy. We're closing for the afternoon, but we'll be back in a few hours for the dinner rush. I'm ready! Let's go! - Why do you have two bottles of wine? - What? It's a wine train. Ooh. You guys going on the wine train? Uh, you get the wine on the train, Lin. You don't have to bring it. Oh Otherwise, it would be just called a train. Right. Lin, you're sure kids are allowed on this thing? It says right here in the brochure, ""Kids are allowed."" It says, ""Kids are allowed, ""but not welcome."" Like in the health and sexuality section at the bookstore. - Where's Gene? - He's picking out his outfit. I'm gonna be Boxcar Gene! Gene, why do you look like Dexy from Dexy's Midnight Runners? - 'Cause we're going on a train! - Well, go put a shirt on. Next thing, you're gonna be telling me to go put on underwear. Put on underwear. Okay. You folks will be seated right here in passenger car one with the big grapes. And I'm gonna take these little raisins back to the end of the vine. - Bye, Mom. - Bye! Whoa! It's the biggest chocolate fountain on a train in North and South America. The world's biggest is in Guatemala. I did not know chocolate came from fountains. I want to put my head in it. And my feet. Ethan, thank you very much for the guided tour. Uh, looks like we'll be setting up shop here for the day. For your troubles. Uh-uh, no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no no. Oh, here you go, one more for you. Uh, kids no. I'm sorry. Okay, one more for you. Oh. Ye actually, uh Thank you, Ethan. if you could put that down. Kids aren't allowed anywhere near the buffet, or the passenger cars. But you are absolutely welcome to the Juice Caboose! Ugh, what a dump. Hey, there's someone there. Regular Sized Rudy? Louise, Gene, Tina what are you doing here? Hold on, Beanbag, I'll be right back. I know these guys from school. Um do you live here? My dad has me on the weekends. He's been online dating and he brings his dates here. But, on the bright side, I get to hang out with ol' Beanbag here. Up top, Beanbag. Boom! Yep. We see a lot of Rudy. Okay rules: One, you can't leave the Juice Caboose for the duration of the trip. Two, don't bother me. And three, uh always believe in yourself. Thanks. We can't leave the Juice Caboose? Are you kidding me?! Get comfy, 'cause this room is your life for the next four hours. But there's nothing to do! Open this door! I can't hear you! The train's too loud honk, honk. Honk, honk?! Trains don't make that noise! All right, this is gonna be great. We have a babysitter and a lot of alcohol. Wait, don't do No, don't do it! It's a tasting. You're supposed to swirl it around and shake the glass to open it up, or something. Hey, open up, wine! Linda's coming in. Uh, okay. Well, you do that. I'm just gonna drink a lot of wine. That guy must really know what he's doing. Why, because he's slurping? Mm Ugh! Oh, my. Excuse me! Hey! Hi! Are you some kind of an expert? I just overheard you doing that sound Oh. I'm a wine enthusiast. Although I'm not enthused by this first flight. Oh! He's hysterical. You should come taste with us. Oh! You can give us tips on how to get tipsy. Sure. Lin, no. I don't want to drink with that guy. Why? I do, Bobby. He's an expert. Well, I was looking forward to a relaxing day off. I wasn't even gonna talk to you that much, to be honest. I just don't want to drink with the guy Hi Look who's here? I'm Rick. I love Italian wines, German cars and Japanese women. I'm Linda! I love showers and mornings and bologna and turtles. And wine! I'm Bob. Well, it looks like we are going to be a tasting trio for the afternoon. Jambo. It means cheers. Cheers! ""Cheers!"" Come on, Bob. If we don't clink, it's not a real Jambo. Mm-hmm. Jambo! Jambo. Jambo! Jambo! Jambo! Uh, okay. - Jambo! - Jambo! No more Jambo. Usually I'm by myself, but since you guys are here, maybe we could take turns sitting on Beanbag. Is that okay with you, Beanbag? Rudy, how can you just sit there, when there's a chocolate fountain behind this door being unappreciated by a bunch of drunk adults? It's being wasted on the wasted! There's got to be a way out of here. There's a hatch in the ceiling. Here, give me a boost. Ahh! It's hot! Bad idea! Bad idea! - Put me down! - Okay. Thank you. Okay. Nobody panic. We're only in here for two hours. Four hours. Four hours! ""Four hours!"" Oh, my God. You know, if you ever want to get serious about wine, you really have to lose the mustache. True, 'cause it gets all caught up in there. Mm-hmm. That makes sense. - Yeah. Pee-ew! Be a lot easier if you just shaved it. I'd rather not, Rick. I'm not shaving it. I didn't bring shaving equipment. Bobby, quit being a pinot grouchio! Look, I'm perfectly happy enjoying my wine, staring out the window at that kid on a bike, going the same speed as us? And we are friends. I call him Ramon. Hi, Ramon! What? Hi! I can't hear you. What? I I can't hear you. I'm in a train. Okay, have a nice bike ride. Whoa. Ramon just threw a rock at me. We're still friends. What kind of God would put a chocolate fountain on a train and not let kids near it?! Yeah! Learn how to build a train, God! Well the chocolate fountain is impressive, but the real supply's all the way up front. What do you mean, ""The real supply?"" There's way more chocolate up in the kitchen. I've seen them load boxes and boxes of it in there. Well, then, are you guys thinking what I'm thinking? That I need a bath? Oh, yeah. You do. No. We break out of here and steal the chocolate from the front of the train! I'd do that. I'm in. Great! The Belcher kids ride again! For the first time! And Rudy! Is there. Okay, if we're gonna rob this train, we need to take it step by step. Luckily, Rudy has been trapped in this caboose for the last nine weekends doing some serious recon. I see everything out this window. Once, a skunk got on the train for a little bit and then it got off and I was the only one to notice. Just take us through the logistics, Train Brain. Okay. Each of these blocks is a train car. This is taking too long! I need chocolate! Gene, quiet. Sorry. It's okay. Now, this is us here in the Juice Caboose. I can see us in there. Just kidding. We're not inside a block. Tina! Okay. The only time the door to the caboose in unlocked, is when Ethan makes a juice box delivery, every hour on the hour. Every hour on the hour. Sounds like a robot. Wait! What if Ethan is a robot!? Gene! Focus! You guys are embarrassing me. In front of Rudy, which is hard! Even if we get out of here, you still have to get all the way up to the kitchen car. The chocolate is kept inside the chocolatier's refrigerator. He's from Germany. The chocolate's from Switzerland. - We're from America. - Yeah! Now, the only time the kitchen is empty is when it's a passenger's birthday and the whole staff comes out to sing the ""Chugga Chugga Choo Choo Happy Birthday To You"" song. So, we know how to get in, but how do we get out? I think I know how, but it's a little dangerous. Like sandwiches with toothpicks in them dangerous? Even more dangerous than that. Like eating a bomb? In between. Like eating a firecracker. Yeah. Okay. Here's what we're gonna do. Well aren't you kids playing nice. Hey, Ethan, over here. Look at my face and hands while I'm talking. I just want you to know it's my mom's birthday today. Um, it isn't June 3, it's today. Okay. Wait, I have some questions for you. Uh-huh. Um, what does ""Ethan"" mean? Um Sounds like how Shakespeare Huh? So, maybe that's where it comes from? Yeah. I don't know. Maybe. Next question, uh if a train leaves New York at 4:00, and another train leaves Dallas at Uh Great. Well, I'm kind of busy right now, so I'm gonna have to let you go. Have fun at my mom's birthday. Bye. Uh do you want juice?! No! Uh, maybe uh, ye no, ye ahh! Mm. I like this one. Ugh! You think you do, but you don't. What do I think of this wine? Great question. Here's what you think. Hey, Ethan. How's Rudy? How's Beanbag? Uh, they're great. Beanbag's great. Rudy's such a delight. I just dropped off some juice for them. Can I get a cranberry juice? Uh-oh Coming right up. Um, who's Rudy? - He's my son. - You have a son? Mandy, you know, I might have left a little information off my E-Kiss profile, but that was just for readability. So, you look nothing like your profile picture and you have a son? Uh-huh. Okay. So, your face is saying one thing No. No. I love kids. Okay. Will you ma I love kids. Can you make eye contact with me? I am. Aren't I? No. You're looking at my chin. No. That's, that's your I'll just get below here. How 'bout now? No. Na I have a son. Are you cool with that?

Five, six, seven and Everybody watch your back the birthday train is on the track! Well, hello, there. Put some wine in your glass, 'cause your life is moving fast, so drink your day away.

She should be out there by now! Who's that? I don't know it's too early for Ethan to come back. Aah! I'm not decent! Come back later! Thank you! I must use the kerplunker! There's a line for the other one. Make it fast. Don't tell me, make it fast. Just go. Don't tell me, just go. Just da ah Make some noise. Sing songs or something. Look, look look at the legs on the glass. You see the legs? I see fe it looks like feet. Oh, Linda. You're such a sweet, simple person. Thanks. Wait, what? Look, Rick, you're not the only person with taste. We happen to own a restaurant. Whoa-ho! It's not a competition, Bob. I didn't say it was. Sounds like this guy wants to have a wine-off! What?! Wine-off? Ooh, wine-off. Wine-off. Wine-off. There's gonna be a wine-off. We got a wine-off! Oh, my goodness. It's going down. Hey oh, s Sorry, sorry. Uh, da, da, da. Too soon? Too too much? Don't.

One, two, three! Wow. That train is not moving very fast. This window won't open. That's why we need to get back in there. Could pick up the pace. You're not going fast enough. I am too going fast enough. No job is done until the paperwork is complete. Stand by. Where the hell is Rudy? Okay. Oh, boy! Oh, oh Oh, wow It's not that bad. You're making a big deal. Wow. You're making Come on. It's like my grandpa. It's not that bad. Where the hell have you been? Pull me up. Hand me the chocolate and then I'll pull you up. Hand you the chocolates? Yeah. And then I'll pull you up. How do I know that once I hand you the chocolate you're not gonna just leave me out here and take the chocolate? I wouldn't do that. That's what I would do. That's so mean. Look, if you don't take this chocolate and leave me out here, then I can't work with you. Please give me the chocolate so I can pull you up. Fine. Okay, Gene. You hold onto me. Got it. Tina, you hold onto me. Great. And then I'll hold onto something in the bathroom. And pretend it's a person holding onto me. Like a boy or an 18-year-old boy. Okay. We're ready. Ah no. Bang-up job, everybody. We got the chocolate in the caboose. Like we planned. The only problem is is that we are not in the caboose! At least we have toilet paper. You guys want any? Thank you. Ugh! Well, we're stranded. Our chocolate's on the train, and there's nothing around here for miles. My boy-dar isn't picking up anything, either. Oh, wait no, that's a deer. We've got to get back to that chocolate before somebody else does. Guys, we're gonna be okay. The train's coming right back here. Wait, what? The train goes down, goes around Lake Waste Water, and comes right back. It should back in 15 minutes, so we should just jump on it. But when is Ethan gonna stop by the Juice Caboose with his next delivery? Let me check my watch. In exactly  15 minutes! This is gonna be close. Mmm. Speak to me. You're hiding from me. I'll find you. Ooh You have got a lot goin' on here, girl. Ugh. Ah, there you are. A California Central Coast Syrah. Okay, Bobby. Now you taste your wine. This one is probably wine. I would say red. Or it could be white. I'm also realizing that I'm not as good at this as I thought I'd be. No, you're not. Chablis is a wine, right? You guys aren't answering me. I'm gonna say that's a good sign. I'm going with Chablis. Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby. You're not good at this. Poor Bob. I can't see your sad, pathetic face right now, but I bet it's crying. I'll tell you what. Linda, pick any wine. It can even be a wine he knows. Any wine? If you can get one wine right, just one, you win the whole competition. In fact, you could pick a wine he had last night. I'll still know it before he does. Ooh, bonus round. Whoever says what it is first, wins. What's the point? You can do this, Bobby. No, I can't. Look at me, Bobby. I-I can't. Yes you can. I have a blindfold on. Well, you can do the mystery wine. All right, fine. Pour it. At least I'll get drunk-ish. That's it, Bobby. Hey, look what's coming around the mountain. The train. Just kidding about the mountain, uh, but the train is remember that song? Uh-oh. Guys, she's coming back faster. This only happens when the train's running behind schedule or this one time when they ran out of rosÃ© and things got weird. It's starting to look kind of like a real train now. Like fast, and dangerous. We could just get a cab. Oh, look, there's Ethan. He's headed toward the Juice Caboose! We need to jump on now, guys. Come on. Hobos do this everyday. I don't understand it. Cliff! You think my name is Cliff? Oh, my God, I love it. I'm Cliff now. Call me Cliff. No, just to clarify: Cliff! We have to get on that train now! We're running out of dry land! I have to go back for my bandana. It's made of cotton! Leave it! Leave it! Oh, damn it! You chose chocolate. It's what your bandana I guess. Oh, no. Now my overalls are stuck. What's going on with my outfit? Do something, Gene! He's almost here! Aah! We have to hide the chocolate. Oh Where are we going to hide it? I don't know. Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, boy. Oh, oh Oh, boy, oh, boy! Ow. Hey, kiddies. Got your juice. Oh, thanks, Ethan. Thanks so much, buddy. We can always count on you for juice and juice-related things and really just juice. But we love juice. Are you kids okay? Oh, we're just great, thanks. Last juice of the day. Great. Uh, cran-apple? Wait a minute. Something's up. Why are you out of breath? Well, my trachea constricts due to histamines that my body produces Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking. Why are your shoes muddy? Because I'm-I'm poor. Oh, I'm so poor. And why are you in your underwear? Because I am rich. There's been a burglary. Somebody stole my chocolate! I am very shocked by that. Okay, what was rule number two? Always believe in yourself? No! Don't bother me. Stealing is bothering. Nobody steals anything on my shift. Yeah! Wha we've been locked in here all day. I don't buy it. I don't buy it, either. I think I know who likes chocolate. Everybody. Yes, right. But especially kids. I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it. I stand by that. It's gotta be in here somewhere. Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here? I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan. Yeah, you gorgeous idiot. Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom. Whew! Eh, maybe give it a minute in there. It's not in there. Get up, Rudy. N-No. Beans didn't do anything. He doesn't have a malicious bean in his bag. No! No! Don't you touch Beanbag! No! All right! Bonus round. Winner takes all. Ready and drink. I know what it is. Oh, you know? From one sip. Yep. So Bob knows it. Say it. I'll give you a chance here. You take a guess. Oh, he's giving Rick a chance. You don't know it. Talk to me, Goose. Get inside me. Take your shoes off. Make yourself comfortable. The wine's inside of Rick. Getting comfortable. Okay. It's a blend Yeah, it's definitely a blend. I'm getting a few things here. It's very complex. Take another sip, Rick. This is gettin' good. Oh, I guess I was wrong. I hope you're happy. He was beautiful. Well, whatever. Enjoy the rest of your ride. I'll go check the busboys. Somebody has the chocolate. Hey, uh I'm sorry you kids had to see that. But, uh it's a hard life on the rails. Yup, yup, so true. So wise. You should teach a class. Bye! I should. You guys sure you don't want any more juice? We don't want any more juice. Get out of here, Ethan. Okay, okay. See you next week, Rudy. We cool? Yeah, yeah. We're cool. Just go. All right. Doesn't sound like we're cool. We're cool! Okay, bye. Everybody, open your mouths. Delicious. It's so delicious. Num, num, num Pace yourself. Pace yourself. Who are you? I know we've met. You're embarrassing me. All right, Rick. Stop stalling. Fine. It's very viscous. It's a Cab-Merlot blend. Okay, okay, okay. Bob, do you know what the wine is? It is a blend. But it's a blend of spit. Because it's from the spit bucket! What? He's right. Bobby wins. What?! You drank spit, Rick. You drank a lot of it. What? You poured that from the spit bucket? Why did you do that? Because I knew Bob would know what it was. Why would Bob know that? Because we went to see Sideways, and after that we went to the wine bar and I bet Bob he wouldn't drink from the spit bucket and he did. That's disgusting. And that's how you win a wine-off. Ah! Wine fight! No, no, no. Not the jacket. Not-not the turtleneck, it's cashmere. That's for lying on your profile. I'm sorry. Look, I'm a middle-aged man who's just trying to get back out there and Mandy, I really like you. That's for making me fall for you. Aw, they're in love. Ah, my face! We got our very own chocolate fountain! Some of it just went down my underwear. I like it. This is the best weekend of my life. It doesn't even matter that I'm allergic to chocolate. Rudy, what? Ugh, stop eating it, then. Oh, 'cause I'm allergic to it? Yeah, what happens when you eat it? I don't know, I've never eaten it. I don't know what Rudy! Rudy! Just kidding. Damn it, Rudy. It's not that bad. I just get a rash on my back. There's my babies. Why are you covered in chocolate? Why are you covered in wine? Don't ask questions. Yeah, ditto. Oh. I feel like I French-kissed the whole train. Uh yum. Hey, Mom, did you have a nice birthday at least? I did. Wait, who told you it was my birthday? Oh, look, there's Ethan. - He's yelling something. - Oh, hey, Ethan, we found your chocolate. It's on our faces and in our tummies. No! Them! They did it. They took the chocolate! It was them, they took the chocolate!"
"The burglar reportedly went in You gotta hit it just right. Linda, please use the ladder, or at least let me do it. I'm fine, Bob. Just gotta find the sweet spot. Lin, I'm gonna come over and steady your legs. All right? There. You see? Got it. Have a little faith, you know? I'm not some clumsy idiot who can't whoa! Linda y-you okay? I'm fine, Bob, I just slipped. Ow! Damn it! - Ow. That l-looked like it hurt. - It's not funny, Bob! Check, please. I know that sounds like I'm saying, ""Check, please,"" but I actually should be going. So check, please. Uh-oh. My wallet is missing. Better start washing dishes. I hope I didn't lose it. I'd hate to have my identity stolen. I'm sure they'd give it right back. - Maybe check the bathroom. - It's worth a try. Now's my chance to sit in his stool and get the Mort experience. Oh Oh! You were right! - It was behind the toilet! - Oh, good! Also, there was a rubber band, a marble and a toothbrush. Those are mine! It's probably a telemarketer. Bob's Burgers. No, I don't have anything to refinance. I wish I did. Unfortunately, my only equity is in my car and, hello? Oh, they hung up. - Super freaky, huh? - What? Linda was right about who was calling and where Mort's wallet was. - Two predictions in a row. - Try a third one, Mom. Okay. The next person to walk in will be tall, dark and handsome. I  I'm already here. Good one, Papa. - Thank you, son. - You're welcome. I've heard of this before. Someone gets hit on their head or gets struck by lightning, - and it unleashes psychic ability. - Right. Right! Yeah! Everything was blurry for a second. That's probably when it was unleashed. Like a dog, when you take a leash off it. Uh you guys are kind of reaching here. No. I've always believed in this sort of thing. Maybe this is happening to me because I'm open to it. Nothing is happening to you, Lin, because this sort of thing isn't real. It was just two small coincidences. - That's what I call my testicles. - Gene. Hmm? Marshmallow in the house. Now, put a burger in my mouth. Oh, hey, Marshmallow. - Tall, dark and handsome. - That settles it, Mom's psychic. No, she isn't. Marshmallow isn't handsome. She's beautiful. Blush Tomato, potato, Dad. Face it, Mom has powers. Promise me you'll use your powers for good, Mom. Promise me! I promise. I promise. Linda's psychic. What's your special power? I can crack anyone's back. Bob, come here. All right, just this once. Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Right there. There you go. Yeah. Ow! Ow! That's it. That's it. I'll lay you down on the floor now. Marshmallow, get off me. That's not helping. Oh, my God! That's a knot. That's all it is. I can't breathe. If Mom really is psychic, we're gonna be on easy street. She can tell us the next big trend in teen fashion. I'll bet it's butt hats. Hats for your butt. No, guys. I mean, we can finally cash in. But we got to figure out if she's the real deal. Mom, what number am I thinking of? Not this again. Uh four. No, nine. No-no-no, four. No. No. Nine. Is she right? I don't know. Now that's all I can think of. That was it. That was it. No. Tina, what number were you thinking of first? I think that was. Uh four or nine. No! I see it burning in my brain. That doesn't prove anything. So, how do you predict things, Mom? How do you do it?! I kind of close my eyes, and, uh, an image appears in my brain. That's called ""having a thought,"" Lin. I don't expect you to understand, Bob. You'll never understand the psychic realm. You know, I feel sorry for you. Let's settle this once and for all. Dad, you give her a test. Okay. If you're psychic, you should be able to tell me what I'm putting in this bowl. Close your eyes. You really don't have to make that sound. Yes, I do. Give me your hands, Bobby. Come on. No. Give me your hands, I got to feel them. Fine. If this go ahead. It's an orange. It's an orange. No Amazing. Wow No. No. No, whoa. No, amazing. It's an orange. Mom's a psychic! No, she's not! Yes, I am! No. No. No. I only make the sound. Don't make you don't make the sound. Oh. I'm sorry. I'm getting an image! It's a ""J."" Do you have someone in your life whose name begins with a ""J""? Yes! My accountant Geoffrey! Aha! Oh, but he spells it with a ""G."" Ah Oh! He's Jewish! Aha! You nailed it! I'm meeting with him later today! That's right. Of course that's right. He just told you. Yeah. Sounds like someone's getting a tax refund. Whoa! All right, good reading. I'm gonna file this year! Do me. Do me. I'm next. Out of the way. Okay. Okay. Mort, get out of the way. Okay, easy. Give me your hands, Teddy. Ew, they're sticky. Mort, stop it! Mort, let her do the reading. I see a color. I see a color. It's your favorite color. Okay. And it's a primary color. That's incredible. It's, uh I'm picking up shades, uh red. Nope. Blue No. Blue No. Green No. Uh yellow. Yes. Yellow. Wow. Yeah! Yes, yes, yeah. Wow. On the 17th try. She got it, though. She got it. Okay. Oh, I'm getting something else. Yellow something, uh Yellow what? A ta a taxi? No. Is it a house? No. Or a shirt? No Is it a dress? Yeah. Yeah. It's a dress. I'm gonna meet a woman in a yellow dress. Yeah! Got it. What else? Uh Th-Th-The change. What is it, Linda? Lo loose change. ""Loose change""? Yeah. You're gonna find a quarter. No, it's a nickel. And maybe that will change my life? Yes. - No. No. No. - Yep. I'm on a path now. Go meet a woman in a yellow dress and find a nickel. It's not a scavenger hunt, Teddy. It is to me. Bye, everyone. Oh, I got to rest. Guys, I figured out how we can use Mom's psychic brain to get us on the gravy train. So, what's the plan? It involves horses and money and us getting some. Some horses? Some money Oh. Hey, kids, how was school? Boring. Meh. Fun. I mean, whatever. What's going on here? Oh. Your mother has gone nuts. I see something, uh it's bell-shaped. It's, uh Yeah? Maybe it's a bell? Is it the Liberty Bell? That's what it is. It's the Liberty Bell. It's the Liberty Bell. My ex-boyfriend lives in Philadelphia. Should I go there? Should I get a cheesesteak? Gretchen! Go to him. I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it! Go to him. Wait till Philly sees my crack. Hi, Bob. Hi. Bye Stay away from trains! I'm gonna get a train ticket. Gretchen, come back! No. No. Well, maybe trains are fine. Well, that seemed to work out, Lin. Yeah. That was another good one. Another one down. Yeah. You just sent a woman, a grown woman to another state, 'cause you claim you're psychic. Yeah. Right. Great. I believe in you, Mother. Thank you, Louise. You have a gift. It's gonna make some people nervous. If this was 1980, you'd be burned as a witch. Exactly. On a happier note, which name do you like more: Sea Bagel, Pride of Detroit, Mudbutt or Gelding the Lily? Lily. Go with the Lily one. What is this for? Oh. We're renaming Tina. Oh! I'm glad I didn't choose Mudbutt. Okay, guys. Mom picked a horse in tomorrow's race. Now all we need is money to place a bet. You guys have money? If you're asking me to sell my hair, the answer is no! Tina, what's left of your savings? $82.40. But, with interest, it could be more than that. I haven't checked for a while. I want to be surprised when I look. Great! We'll put $82 on Gelding the Lily, collect our winnings and split it three ways. Three ways? But I'm putting up all the money. But it was my idea, and Gene's your brother. Probably. And we'll spend the day looking at horses! Let's do it. Order up, Lin. Can you take this over? Shh. Not now, Bobby. I'm getting something. Hold on. Oh, my God. This is weird. I'm feeling something. No, you're not. Dizzy Dog, the beloved statue who's welcomed visitors to Wonder Wharf for over 30 years, has been dognapped from his familiar place at the end of the pier, leaving police baffled. If you have any information on the whereabouts of Dizzy Dog, please call in to our tip line. Dizzy Doggy. Hello? Tip line? Seriously, Lin? Hi. Hello, tip line? Hold on, hold on. I have a tip. Are they confused why Jerry Lewis is calling? I You know, I see water. Uh, Lin, stop. Hang up the phone. he's surrounded by water, and I also see Do not do this. a foamy substance. This is ridiculous. Stop. Bob, I'm on the phone. And he's crying out. Dizzy Dog's crying out, ""Help me. Lin, Help me. Help me."" hang up. It was one thing when you were just playing with Mort and Teddy and Gretchen, but when you call in a tip to the news, it's kind of taking things to another level, Lin. Why is it so hard for you to believe, Bob? Because it's not possible, Lin. That's what Coach Blevins said about me doing a sit-up, and now look. Yeah, Dad. Why can't you just be supportive? Get Mom's back? Yeah. Aw, forget it. Tina, I'm not supporting this because it's irresponsible. And not real. Oh, yeah? Well, I predict you fall down a flight of stairs. Is that a threat? No. It's a warning. Be very careful, that's all. Okay. Sounds good. Tripity tripity, dibidy do. What? Look. Wonder Wharf's own Dizzy Dog is home safe after apparently being knocked off the pier into the ocean. Yay! Dizzy Dog is safe! The discovery was made thanks to a tip from Linda Belcher, local psychic. What?! Wow. Ha! They found him in the water! All right, Mom! We always believed you, Mom. Remember that?  I got power.  Will you pass that rag, Linda Belcher, local psychic? I predict, yes. Oh, my God. Dad, why can't you just let Mom have this? Like I let Gene be the family jokester. I could be that. So, Lin, I was just curious, when am I gonna fall down that set of stairs? I haven't fallen down a set of stairs yet. You're stealing her thunder again! So now you believe. No But if I did, when would it happen? At fall-thirty. What? See? What? Sorry, Gene, you can say it. At fall-thirty. It's funnier when Gene says it. Yeah. Hello, Linda Belcher. Hey! Sergeant Bosco! Apparently, you're some kind of psychic? Yeah. Well, some people think so. Oh, my God. Well, you really came through with that Dizzy Dog thing anyway. Oh, my God. I need your help with another case. A real case. This is the big time. Hit me with it. You're going to help me catch the Little Boy Bandit. The Little Boy Bandit from the news. You've got to be kidding. Mom is a police psychic! Narc! I gotta go lay down. So you want me to help you catch the Little Boy Bandit? That's a big case. It's huge. And I don't want your help, I need it. I'm desperate on this one. The Little Boy Bandit has robbed eight businesses in the past month. That makes me look bad. I'm not sure about using my powers to catch a little boy. Like a fairy tale witch. No, we think he's a very small man wearing kid's clothes, a wig stapled to his baseball cap, and those roller shoes to get away. Blend into the crowd, you know? Sounds like Sandy Duncan. Everybody sounds like Sandy Duncan to you, Mom! Sandy Duncan this, Sandy Duncan that. Oh! Look, I'm under a lot of pressure to catch this guy, and I got nothing! So you're open to the idea of psychic abilities? In any other situation I'd say no and laugh in your crazy face. But I'm out of leads. You're my last hope. You're doomed. I'll help however I can, Sergeant. Great. Let's roll. Bye, kids! Keep your father away from the stairs! Have Dad run up and down the stairs. Got it! Your job is on the line and you brought in a psychic? Yeah. She called the Dizzy Dog thing. If this doesn't work out, the captain's gonna put you back on patrol. I'd miss you! Don't worry about it. So, here are all the places the Little Boy Bandit has hit. Mm There seems to be no pattern, but maybe you'll get a feeling or something. Huh, he seems to go after the stores that have little flags on 'em. Never mind. Let's just go touch stuff in the evidence room. All of these items were handled by the Little Boy Bandit during his various robberies. So grab something and see if you get a reading or whatever. Wow! What was this used for? Put that down! Hah. It's for a different case. Wha-ga-ning. Okay, but you got the wrong guy. Really? I think. Just kidding. We know we got the wrong guy. Oh. Try this. All right, let's see. Uh! Nothing's coming to me. Come on. Just do whatever you did for the knife! Ticktock! I'm still figuring out how this works! I don't know when it comes and goes. I hit my head the first time. Maybe I need to get hit again? Okay. No, no, no, maybe I'm just hungry or something. Fine. Let's go get lunch. Ooh, do we get free hot dogs from the carts? I do, you don't. Hi, kids. Hi, Teddy. Teddy, guys! This quest your mom sent me on is exhausting. I haven't found a nickel or any women in yellow dresses. But I did find this penny in a urinal! Ew. Ah, no! My pee penny! So why'd you guys want to meet me here? Our mom sent us on a quest, too. We're supposed to bet on a horse. Wow! That's much better than finding a nickel. And we need our favorite Teddy to place the bet for us. Hey, maybe you'll see a lady in a yellow dress at the track, hmm? Or a horse in a yellow dress. At this point, I'd take either! So let's go gamble, huh, kids? Uh, need some more buns. Tripity tripity, dibidy do. Huh. Why don't we have a railing? Huh. Okay. Easy does it. Looking good. Halfway down. All right, Linda, that's your fourth dog. Anything coming to you yet? Nah. Uh, not yet. Oh, wait, something's coming, something's coming. Oh. It's just a burp. I'm gassy. Come on, Linda, focus. Sorry. Look, if I don't catch this guy, my captain'll tear me a new one. Now take a look in that brain of yours and tell me where he's gonna strike next. All right, give me a minute. Psychics didn't predict Rome in a day, hold on. Ooh Oh, I see a building. Good, keep going. I see walls. Yeah. Oh, and, uh, windows. All right. You can see right out 'em. Yeah, I get it. There's, uh, oh, there's something on the wall. Maybe pictures. What are you talking about? Art? - Building with art? -  I'm still gassy, uh What about the Wharf Art Center? Is it the Wharf Art Center? War Farts? Wharf Arts. They have a charity ball thing going on there right now, today. Lots of wallets and purses and jewelry. Let's roll. Let's go down there. I'm still eating my hot dog. They have food at the thing. Tell Mom and Dad that I'll miss them, but I'm home now. Oh, crap. Need tomatoes. Here we go. Wait a second. I know how to do this. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You still feel good about this, Linda? I hope you do. Yeah, it's beautiful. Not that crap, your vision. Stop eating. My whole career is on the line. I have a lot of cops undercover here. I keep telling him to quit the force and just play.  La, la, la, la, la.  All right, get out of here, you're gonna blow our cover. Okay, okay.  La, la, la, la.  Shush. Stop it. - I'm back. - Oh, good. Nothing you told anyone was remotely accurate, and now everyone is mad at you. What? It's true, Linda. I went to Philadelphia last night and I find out my ex-boyfriend is married and he's faithful. Thanks a lot. Well Yeah, and my meeting with my accountant - was because I'm being audited. - Aw. I dry cleaned my Speedo like you said, and now it looks ridiculous. Yeah, and not only did I not win the shrimp-eating contest, there was no shrimp-eating contest. And I owe the Shrimp Hut $200. Aw. Yeah. And I have yet to fall down any stairs. In fact, I've gone up and down many sets of stairs. Just for fun, once. So you're not psychic. But I don't get it. I got all those other predictions right. Or did I kind of just use common sense? I guess I saw Mort's wallet falling out. And telemarketers call around 3:00 every day. And I guess your hand smelled like oranges. Oh, God. I Kaiser-Soze'd myself. So you're saying you are not I'm not psychic. Wow, who could have seen that coming? Just me, I guess. Oh, I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry. Don't throw Stop throwing things. I guess I got carried away. I let you all down. You sure did. Well, at least no one got hurt. Uh-oh. What? Bosco's in deep. Because of me, he staked his whole career on the Little Boy Bandit robbing the charity ball. Bob's Burgers. Bobby, it's me. I'm at the track. Is Linda sure the dress is yellow? Well Could it be a floral pattern? And not a dress but a vest? Teddy. Teddy. I think we're supposed to meet, but I'm not feeling any chemistry, to be perfectly honest. Teddy. Teddy. Nothing. Like, zero. Teddy. W-What's up, Bob? Listen, shockingly, it turns out Linda's not psychic. Oh. Yeah. Oh. That's actually a relief. I was terrible at her predictions. But, boy, the kids are gonna be crushed. Why? They put all their money on that horse Linda picked. Wait, where are the kids? They're with me at the track. What? You didn't know, Bobby? No. You really should keep a better eye on your kids, Bobby. You know, they could end up anywhere. In this case, they're safely with me at the track. Nothing to worry about. Tina, don't touch that. Louise, get off of the track, the horses are racing. I'd better go. Bye, Bob. Teddy? Teddy? Okay, you go tell Bosco you're not psychic. I have to go pick up the kids from the track, where you sent them. Aw, nuts. Bosco. Bosco. What? What are you doing here? I got bad news. I guess, uh I guess I'm not a psychic after all. A real psychic. Amateur. What? Well, uh, yeah, uh, sorry. Listen, I've put everything on the line here, because you said you were psychic. So you better get psychic and fast. I'm arresting somebody tonight. Who you gonna arrest? You. Me? Yes. For what? Eating too many hot dogs? Impersonating a psychic. Oh. Ooh. Hey, look. That's Gelding the Lily. Our race is next. I want to get his autograph. Kids. There you are. And Teddy. Teddy's here, too, Bobby. Hi, Teddy. Come on, everyone, let's go. No, no, no, no, no. But our race is next. We already placed our bet. And Tina is getting an autograph from a horse. He's not great at holding a pen. Then can you sign it as him? Ugh, fine. You just have to put the pen in your mouth. Uh, I kind of don't have all day. Here, like this. Just like you're a horse. Like how a horse would s would sign an autograph. See? Oh, you dropped your wig. Uh, thanks. What's that for? I am a birthday clown. I got a thing after the race. Oops. You dropped your roller shoe. What's this for? It is for my clowning. I'm a roller skate clown jockey guy. Wow, triple threat. Oh, my God. He's the Little Boy Bandit. What did you say? Me? Nothing. Uh, have a great race. Oh, thanks. W-What? I said thanks. Did you say thanks? Oh, sorry, you go. Thank you. No problem. I predict this is my husband. Just kidding, I knew it was. Caller ID, sorry. Hello? Linda. He's here. The Little Boy Bandit is at the track. He's a jockey. What? His race is about to begin. Tell Bosco. Get him here as soon as you can. Bosco. Good news. Bobby just called and said Let's go, Gelding the Lily. He'd run so much faster without metal shoes. And they're in the home stretch. Gelding the Lily is pulling away. Come on. Come on! He's actually gonna win. Go! No, no, no, no, no, no! We would have won. I think I'm gonna have my next birthday party here at the track. So the Little Boy Bandit will be riding off into the sunset, to jail. I'm here with arresting officer Sergeant Bosco. if you commit a crime and you're under five feet tall, Bosco will catch you. I did have some help, though, from a friend. My gun. And his friend, my other gun. - Oh. - When's this gonna air? We're live. Well, I'm just happy that we can all agree now there is definitely no such thing as psychic powers. Oh, I still believe, Bob. What? Yeah. I may not have psychic powers myself, but I know they exist. After everything that's happened, Lin. Yes, Bob. I have faith in the unknown and you don't. If I had to do it all over again, I would. Who knows? You got to stay open to this stuff. Lin, you almost cost a man his job. But in a way, Mom helped Bosco catch the Little Boy Bandit. No, she didn't. We saw him and then called her. But if Mom hadn't thought she was psychic, we never would have gone to the track in the first place. Yeah, Dad. - See, Bob? -  You're all nuts. There is no such thi Ow. Oh. Bob? Yup? You all right? Yeah. Did you just fall? No. I did not fall. Okay. I walked down the stairs. Walked down the stairs really fast. I thought I just heard a fall. G-Gene. Yeah? Will you come down here for a sec? Sure, I'd love to. She is psychic. She is a witch. Burn her! Nothing's coming to me."
"Good morning, Chariot. Good morning, Peggy-Sis. Do you want to run into town? No. It's too hot to trot. Xandar! Equestranauts, I've cast a spell on Horse Valley Farm that will bring a thousand years of darkness. Oh, no. We have to stop him. To the stable. Peggy-Sis. Headhorn. Chariot. And Minnie. The Equestranauts! Do I like this show? Neigh I do not. I told you we should have watched reruns of Melrose Place. So, Chariot, are you as excited about going to the Equestranaut convention today as I am? Maybe even more excited. Well, it's not a contest, Chariot. You ready to go, honey? I was born ready. Let's giddyap, people. Wait, you guys are going, too? Uh, we're not not going to a toy-pony convention. And Chariot's gonna get a new saddle. Finally. Chariot? That's kind of a weird name for a horse, isn't it? Why is that? It's like, ""Hey, who's pulling the chariot? It's Chariot."" Oh, my God. Why am I analyzing this show? Anyway, you guys can't all go. Who's gonna help me with the restaurant? Not me. I traded shifts with Antonio. Never mind. Never mind. Just go. Yay! Guess I'll be here with Antonio, the employee Gene made up. You should know, he thinks you killed his father, so he may seek revenge. Good luck. Hey, Bob. You going to EquestraCon? Uh, no, Teddy. Because that's a convention for little girls that like toy horses. Uh, beg to differ, Bob. It's for guys that like toy horses. They're called Equesticles. ""Equesticles""? Yeah. 'Cause they got testicles. 'Cause they're men. I'm really here. I'm really here. I'm Where am I? This isn't a community of my peers. Does anyone else think these girls all look like men? I think they are men. This is a kind of man. We discovered a new kind of man. Do you think they're dangerous? Mmm no. Oh, God. Poor Tina. I know, right? Why do men have to ruin everything? I don't know. But we kind of do. What's with us? Aah! All the war. All of the war. And this, too. It is a good show, though. It is? Yeah. It's pretty good. Well, some episodes before the reboot. So, I guess we should jump on in there. Oh, no. I said I wanted to ""see"" it, not, like, walk around in it. On my legs. Yeah, Tina. What do we look like to you? People that walk on their legs? Well, I'm gonna go check out the food court. Oh, yeah. Let's watch them eat. And watch me eat. You guys should see what I can do with nachos these days. What? You'll see Okay. I guess I'll just take a lap. Meet you back here in 12 hours? Ooh. I like this one. That's hand-stitched. They're $95. $95? You could buy an actual saddle for that. Okay. Never mind. I guess I can't get you a new saddle, girl. Don't look at me like that. Nice Chariot doll. Is it your dad's? No. It's mine. Wha What's, what's the matter, little lady? I guess I just feel a little out of place here. Maybe because I don't have enough money. And I'm not a grown man. Oh. You can barely tell. Listen, why don't you hang out with us? This is Sunpuddle. Ta-da. Horseplay. Pleasure. Pony Danza. Neigh! And I'm Bronconius. Great. I'm Tina. I was starting to feel like I didn't belong. Are you kidding? Everyone belongs here. That's what the Equestranauts is all about. You can be anything you want to be. No judgments. Well, some judgment by me, like this. Hot mess. Hey. Are you okay? You're a cute mess. I want to talk more about that pony, Tina. When'd you get it? I came out of the womb with it. Just kidding. I got it on my fifth birthday. I didn't recognize it as a joke at first. Well, my theory is the original series and the reboot take place in the same multiverse. Yes! That totally makes sense. Then how do you explain the Incepticon? Come on. Were they Incepti-kidding? I guess they were. Say, Tina, have you ever thought about, uh selling that pony? Oh, no. Why, Bronconius? Oh. Just Bron-curious. So you're the original owner? Yeah, but I hate to say I'm her owner. I prefer mother, caretaker, best friend and role model. And she couldn't ask for a better role model. Look at all you've accomplished Tina, with your bangs and your socks. Thank you. Oh. Hey. Oh, my gosh. What's this? Why, it's the new Cosmic Twinkle Chariot doll. Gee, and I don't even really need it. Want to just trade straight up? Yeah I-I don't know. Tina. Tina. Tina. Face it, your Chariot doll's looking a little giddy-yuck. Me and the guys here think you deserve an upgrade. Right, guys? Right, guys? Ye yeah. Right. Yeah, I think that. Sure. Treat yourself. See? This is  gross. But this Oh so pretty. It is pretty. Everyone will envy you. Um okay. Great! Well, got to gallop. What? Oh. Guys, let's pick it up. Bye. B-Bye. The rarest Chariot doll is mine! And all I had to do was swindle little miss Tina-bopper. She had no idea what it was worth! What the? Uh, great, Bronconius. Good job. Tina, did some guy just swindle you out of your toy horse? What? No. I mean, kind of. Why did you say that? He just said it. Wha? Who? Wha What's going on? Wha? Tina got swindled! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ah! I told you, we should never have left the food court! How could I be so stupid? Bronconius played me for a fool. I can't believe someone cheated you out of your doll. Equesticles! Can't trust them. Why would somebody do that? What's so special about your horse? ""The rarest Equestranaut."" Only six in the world! My Chariot was rare? She never even mentioned it. She was so humble. It has a rare production defect. It has camel toe. It has camel toes? No. Camel toe. Oh Well, this is ridiculous. She's just a kid. And I bought that the night before your fifth birthday when your mom remembered we didn't have anything else for you. I'm going down to that convention and I'm getting that doll back. Bronconius isn't gonna just give it back, Dad. Wake up! He tricked Tina! We got to fight trick with trick! Like what, Louise? Dad's gonna waltz in there disguised as an Equesticle with a complete knowledge of the show, earn their trust, infiltrate their inner sanctum, then steal Chariot back? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! And yes! No, no and no. Oh, come on! We've always wanted to give you a makeover. And I've always wanted to make you a silly costume that you have to wear in public. And you love me and would do anything for me. Yeah, do it for us. Okay. Fine. Yay! Undercover Horse Dad! I love a good picnic after completing a mission. And I love a good picnic after completing a picnic. Minnie! So, Minnie's power is, she's small? Yes, Dad! And it comes in extremely handy in many of their missions. Focus, damn it. I'm sorry, Tina. I'm trying. Dad, you have to be perfect. These people know everything there is to know about the Equestranaut multiverse. One slipup, and it's over. Okay. So, I'll just watch this a few more times, take notes and And all these. Okay. And read all of this. Uh, that's a lot. And when you brush your teeth tonight, use this Chariot toothbrush. Seriously? We can't take any chances. Fine. I'll use it. So, the mane is the bristles. Right. Right. I got that. Well, you're doing it backwards. Oh. Oh. Right. It has two manes. Oh. That's the tail. No. That's Yes. I got it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wow! Amazing. I, uh I have no words. Dad, pop quiz: Who did Horsana marry in season three? Prince Horson. No. It was King Horsely. Correct. And what's the capital of Horse Valley? Well, a lot of people would say Horseterdam, because that's the largest municipality, but it's actually Salt Lick City. That's right. Ha! I would have said Horse-pelier. And finally, who would win in a fight between all four Equestranauts? Oh, my God. Um trick question. Because the Equestranauts have a bond of friendship greater than any force in the universe, so they would never have a fight. You're ready. Bobby, this whole thing is turning me on. You're like a sexy spy. Yeah. I kind of am. Whoa. Except I'm wearing a horse costume. Yeah. Remember, you're Bucephala. She's their favorite minor character, so you'll have something to talk about. Your pony name is Bob-cephala. Why do I even need a name? Do you have a pony name? No! I'm a girl. Girls who watch the show are just girls. But you're a man. So act like a man and use your pony name. Wait! I think I see them! Where? Where? Right behind you. Abort! Abort! Take your cyanide capsule. Gene, get off the phone. Hey, nice Bucephala. Thanks. She's, uh, my favorite minor character. Well, have a great 'con! I was just gonna walk in this direction as well. So, yeah, I-I oh, man, I love the Equestranauts. Uh-huh. Yeah. Very much. All the different ponies interacting. It's my phone. One moment. What is it? Dad, you're tense. I can tell from here you're tense. Just relax. Do it! Do it! Relax. Do it! And, Dad, you walk funny. Not helping, Gene. I'm just saying, work on that. Okay. Anyway, have you guys ever heard of this rare Chariot doll that Look! There's Bronconius. What now? Dad, that's him. That's the guy that took my pony. Do not let him see you walk. Hi, Bronconius. Have you been having a super great time today? Up-bup-bup-bup-bup. Who's this fella? This Bucephela. Uh, it's actually Bob-cephela, but you can call me Bob. It's a shortened form of the name. Nice costume. Oh. Thank you. No. I was being sarcastic. It's ridiculous. Uh what's wrong with it? Actually, it's like 50% the costume and 50% the way your body looks in it. Well, season five, episode 12 called, and it wants your costume back after you wash it. Got a little bite in you, huh? Little kicky? Um I like it. Oh. Question: What's wrong with our faces? They're not painted. Face painting booth! Bob-cephela? Yeah! Def uh, yeah. Count-count me in to that. Look at Bob. He's so happy. What a playdate. He's so deep undercover, he's forgotten who he is. Oh, my God! What if he becomes a double agent and starts spying on us for them? What a day. Phew! After all that fun, it would be great just to sit down and chat about, like, what rare collectibles we've gotten recently, right? You go first. Well, I'd love to, but I got to go primp for the party. You going to the party? The party? Uh, yeah uh, yeah, sure. You primp? You groom? Yeah, I-I primp and groom. Good. So we'll all go primp and groom and meet back up at the party. So we'll talk at the party? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got to go, got to primp! See you there, Bob-cephela! Tina, clear some space on your bookshelf. Chariot is coming home. I don't keep Chariot on my bookshelf. It's a saying, Tina! I could clear some space on my dresser. Forget it. Okay, bookshelf. Hey, guys! Bob-cephala! Drink? Sure. We were just talking about which Equestranaut has the best power. Oh, I'm not getting in the middle of this one. Oh, come on, Bob, you have to answer. Well, it's definitely not Headhorn. What?! What?! Hold on! I was just kidding, Horseplay. Relax. Oh, I'm sorry. I really like Headhorn. Wow. Ugh! What is in this? It's a cocktail, designed by and for Equestranaut lovers. It's called Horse Medicine. This will really help you get into character, Bob. Great. Bob-cephela! Did you primp? Yeah. I mean, I thought I did. But you didn't groom. I did, Bronconius! Please. Sunpuddle. Shh. Can I refill your trough? I-I, um, I have one. Thanks, I'll Two, please, maestro. I'll have another. I'm impressed with all the studying Dad did. He has a real mind for Equestranauts trivia. The most useful skill in the world. I know, right? How did this get in here? It's non-canonical! It's what? Are you trying to say nautical? Non-canonical! Non-canonical! She's gone crazy! Let's put her down! Dad, call me as soon as you get this! You're in trouble! Non-canonical! Non-canonical! So, great party. I mean, really good dancing. Oh, God. Except for that guy. You're such an Equestrabully. It's refreshing. Sometimes it gets a little too happy in Horse Valley, you know? Sure. I feel that way, as well, all the time. Hey, uh, can I ask you something? I know you're the expert around here on Equestranaut stuff. Oh, well, it's just something I've proven time and time again. Well, I heard a rumor that there's this really rare Chariot doll with, like, major camel toe. Do you know if that's true? Oh, it's true. Course, I'd never seen one myself until Bronconius! Come dance with us! Mmm, Bob, come, let's show them how it's done! Mom, Dad's in danger! Oh, what are you talking about? He's surrounded by men who play with toy ponies. He's in the least amount of danger possible. No! When I gave him all the stuff to study, I accidentally put in some of my Equestranaut fan fiction! That means he thinks certain zombie-horse-related things happened that didn't. And if he says the wrong thing, they'll know he's not an Equesticle! We have to go find him! Tina, I love you, but please don't make me go back there. It smells bad. We have to go! Oh, man, this is powerful stuff. Whew! This is great! Almost as great as when the Equestranauts had a dance party and met that girl from Earth with dark hair and glasses that had three boyfriends. What? Nothing. Uh, I feel good! Where are we going? Gentlemen, the after-party. This looks scary. I mean, fun. I like it. Sunpuddle, no, no, no, no. That's Bob's seat. Are you named Bob? Oh. I was just Bob, come. Sorry, Sunpuddle. Oh, he's always doing that to me. All these Equesticles. We both know they're weak, pathetic. I-I don't think that. Yes, you do. I do sometimes, yeah. We're tougher than them. We don't fear death. What? That's why we're best friends, Bob. We're best friends? Are you asking? Because I accept. And I'm going to let you in on a little mind-blowing Equestra-miracle I've discovered. You were inquiring about the camel-toed Chariot? Yes, uh, yeah, yeah. Follow me. Ugh! Where's Dad? He could blow his cover any second! We got to find that Bronconius guy! But how?! Who wants a ride to Bronconius's party? Oh. Good. Mom? Mom? We're following him. But I want to dance. Go, girl! Mom! Ooh, ah. Fine. You kids never take me dancing! I want to show you something extraordinary. Oh, my God, this is it. What? Uh, nothing. Just that, um, that's a great-looking safe. Oh. Uh, thanks? It's the hotel's, but, Bob, feast your eyes upon the rarest Equestranauts ever produced. The Scottie Pippen Special Edition Headhorn. Estonian Version Peggy-Sis, Peggy-Stroika. This thing brought down the wall. A gold-plated Minnie previously owned by Jon Hamm. And my greatest treasure of them all the ultra-rare camel-toe Chariot. Yes! Yes! Oh, God, that's a great collection you have there. Uh, can I take a look at the Chariot one? Oh, this is more than just a mere collection, Bob. You see, the Equestranauts are eternally young. They have a power. And the rare ones more power still. But I can harness that power and take youth from them. Do you know how old I am, Bob? I'm 49, but I look Or 20. Yes. Yeah, or younger. Bob, my best buddy, you could join me. We could live forever. All you have to do is merge mouths like this. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, I'm getting younger. I can feel it. Can you tell, Bob? Uh, yup, mm-hmm, yup. Look around the side of the eyes. You see it? Yeah, yeah, uh, looking good. Do you still recognize me? Do you? Immortality! Equestranauts never die. Uh, you know, except for Zombie Horse. I beg your pardon? Zombie Horse, the fifth Equestranaut. He died, and then became a zombie. Zombie Horse. Why am I telling you? You've seen every episode. Indeed, I have seen every episode. Anyhoo, uh, let me plant my lips on that Chariot, uh Why don't we get back to the party? But I-I, you know, I want to I really want to kiss the doll. Later. So, you're a real Equesticle, aren't you, Bob? Yeah, of course. W-Why wouldn't I be? Well, then, Bob, you'll have no problem getting the official unofficial Equesticle ""tuh-too."" Uh, I no. No. I Not-not a problem to get a tattoo. Maybe not, but maybe I would think I would think about it. Remove your shirt. Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, no! What are they doing to my Bobby? I think he was getting a back massage with a needle and men holding him down. A tattoo! They're tramp-stamping our tramp! How's my best buddy doing? Um, very excited, but I'd sure love to check out those dolls again real quick, and, um, I think I have to pee. Should I pee now? Right after this. Um guys, maybe just a little tattoo? How about just a little one? Oh, uh-huh. Mmm. Like, really little, like, tiny? Little tiny little one? Yeah, that'd be great. Mm-hmm. Sure, Bob. Sure. Do this that size. Bronconius, I-I don't think we should Quiet! Okay, sounds good. Of course, Bob, if you've never had a tuh-too before, sometimes a really small tuh-too feels like you're getting a big giant tuh-too, but that's just an illusion of the senses. Oh, God, I wish you would call it ""tattoo."" What am I saying? ""Tuh-too."" It's fine. Let's just get this over with. Let me in! It's Tina! The girl whose pony Bronconius stole! Don't tattoo my dad! Counterpoint do tattoo him! Make it say ""I love Linda."" Or give him some more nipples! You can never have enough! Ask a cat. I knew it! You never were a real Equesticle, and you lied to me. My best friend! Oh, please! It would go Sunpuddle, then Horseplay, then Pony Danza before you. Oh, Bob, we could have had everything. We could have had the whole world to ourselves. And you threw it all away, and for what? Your daughter?! Um yes. You're crazy. Tuh-too him! Stop! Oh, the door was unlocked. Yeah, it's so we don't have to get up every time someone else arrives. You, be gone! I'm done with you. But I'm not done. Look at what you've all become. You've betrayed the meaning of the Equestranauts. And I don't mean the sexually-charged, awkward, confusing vibe at this party. I like sexually-charged, awkward, confusing things, too. Like, for instance Tina. Sorry. But being an Equesticle means no judgment, right, Horseplay? I mean, you accepted me, and I don't even have testicles. Bronconius hijacked this thing you all love and tainted it. He's the real Xandar. I know who that is. He's the bad guy. Hush! Get her out of here! Like, now! The Eqranauts would never turn against a fellow pony. The Equestranauts have a bond of friendship greater than any force in the universe, and you know that! She's right. Here, get up. What?! I'll tuh-too him myself! Mm-mm! Mm-mm! You were never nice to us! You never even took the time to get to know us, and we're all really terrific! Oh, phew. Put a shirt on! Wait! Dad did get a tattoo! I did? What-what does it look like? Is it is it cool? It's not cool. No, it's cool sort of. Someday you will all die, and I will still have the body of a 20-year-old! All right, great, let's open that safe. Ha! You'll never get into that safe! The combination is based on an Equestranauts reference so obscure that only the smartest, most knowledgeable Equesticle in the world could figure it out! That Equesticle is me. Front desk? There you go. Oh, well, that was actually easy. Thank you. Chariot, I missed you. So, good party? So fun. Okay, well, bye, everyone. Sunpuddle, I'll call you. You better. Hey Tina, you must be enjoying having Chariot ba Hey. What's going on? I'm packing up Chariot. What? Why? Oh, I'm just getting a little old to play with dolls, you know? But thanks for getting her back. Hurray. Tina What? Play with the doll. But I'm too old to Tina, play with the doll! Play with the doll, Tina! Come on, do what Daddy says. Mmm Play with it! Okay! I'll Neigh! Make it jump! Uh, well, the she doesn't actually jump. I know it doesn't jump! You know how I know that? 'Cause 'Cause I read 1,200 pages of Equestranaut crap! Mmm - Keep playing with it! - Okay. Good night. Good night."
"Low tide is great. The ocean is just giving this stuff away? If you see any bottles, check for a romantic message inside. I call dibs on any hook hands or peg legs. Hey, what do you think this is? It smells disgusting! No, wait, it smells amazing! Like the boys' locker room on a hot summer day. Gross! Great! Gross! Great! I can't stop smelling this enigma of gross-great. Is that what sex will be like? Hey, Mr. Fisch! Hey, m'lady Bob. Uh, rent's not due, is it? I mean more due than usual? Relax. I just stopped by to introduce you to my brother. Brother? I didn't know you had a brother. Yep, I have a brother. Felix. He's, uh, in town for a while. His inheritance ran out. So he'll be doing some of the landlording around here. Keep him out of my hair, will you? Um, o-okay. Where is he? He's right, uh Oh. Uh, oh, he might not want to come in. - Felix, come here! - No! Felix It looks gross! Please, Felix. It's okay to come in. I came in, and look at me. I'm fine! There you go. Hi, pal. - Hi! Greetings! - I don't want to be here. Shush. For all your landlording needs, Felix is your man. Oh, uh, great. Well, did you get my messages about the bathroom? That I left you? For the last several months? Yes, I got them. How the hell did you get my number? You gave it to me when we met. Not to use! Well, uh, last week, the sink exploded. And the hot water is brown. Hot brown water? Felix loves hot brown water. I do? He's good at all that stuff that you just were yammering on about. Well, gotta go. Okay, so do you want to call a Yes, I'll call whatever you were about to say. Plumber. Plumber. Of course, yes. Why? You know, I can just call him. I'm supposed to call him! Okay. Oh, my God. Is it always like this? Does it always take this long? Is there always this much talking? What? Don't say anything else! I'm not getting roped into another hour-long discussion! I'll call your plumber! Good-bye! Rich people run funny. Must be all the money in their pockets. Or it's their big, rich, golden wieners. Eh, it's probably their wieners. Yep. Guys, you know that lump we found on the beach? My name's Gene! No, the smelly lump. His name's Gene! The other lump. It's called ambergris. Ambergris, aka beach garbage. ""When a whale ""eats a squid, the sharp squid beak may irritate the whale's digestive system."" Hey, whale, maybe stop eating sharp squid beak! What are you trying to do?! ""When that happens, ""the whale's stomach coats the squid beak ""in a waxy substance that the whale then passes."" Passes to who? Like in sports? Boring whale sports. I think ""passes"" means ""poops out."" Go on. Ambergris is used in the production of high-end perfumes."" People pay to wear whale poop? Wake up, Louise! People wear all sorts of animal poops we don't even know about! It's not poop at all. It's a waxy substance that whales secrete from Whoa! You can eat it! ""King Charles II's favorite meal was ambergris and eggs."" Yep, he looks like a breakfast-for-dinner kinda guy. That piece sold for $30,000? Our piece is bigger than that piece. Ah! Jackpot! Wait, whoa, whoa, where is our piece? Where is it? Gene put it in Mom and Dad's bed. Hey, why are you going into our bedroom? Probably putting something gross in our bed. I'm taking something gross out of your bed! Oh, good. Thanks, sweetie! Okay. Here it is. I'm holding $30,000 in my hands. If somebody wants this and has that much money, they will give it to us? Am I saying that right? That can't possibly be right. Slice me off a little nugget of that, will ya? I just want to rest it on my tongue. No way, Gene. Hey, but with your share of the money, you can buy some other ambergris and eat that. Yes! It's like instant gratification but later! Uhhhh What, Tina? We can't sell it. What are you talking about? Ambergris is illegal to sell because whales are endangered. Oh, well. I'll just, um, look up the number for the whale crimes unit. Tina? No. You're right. We can just ask Mom and Dad what to do with it. They're pretty cool. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Tina, you're not telling Mom or Dad or anybody, do you hear me? We found it, we're the ones who are gonna get rich, okay? But it's illegal. Tina, sweetie Yeah? Guess what? I got a secret. Hmm? Okay. Okay, ready? You want to hear the secret? Yeah, what is it? Ah! We're selling it! Tina, tell me the secret. Juicy. Good morning, parents! And good morning to you, partners in victimless crime. Uhhhh What do you think the odds are that Felix will send a plumber today? Twenty-twenty! Wait, is that an odd? Speaking of odd, uh, yesterday, on the beach, Gene, Louise and I found a Sister! A word? What the hell was that? You're gonna blow our whole operation. I'm sorry, Louise; I just wanted to get Mom and Dad's advice about whether we should tell Mom and Dad. I mean, whales are endangered, so Just-just find a whale to give your money to when this is all over, okay? Start a whale scholarship or something! Greetings, sisters. Gene, what are you nibbling on? Is that a piece of the lump? Um, I'm protecting it. Give it to me. Mm-mm Give it to me Mm-mm. You spit it out. Mm-mm. Mm. You spit it out. Open up that craw! Mm-mm. Uh-uh. And spit it out! Listen up, blubber lover, Uh-huh. you use your share to buy more ambergris that's the plan, remember? Oh, all right! God, you're like a goat. I am like a goat! Listen, I thought of a connection who can help us move this stuff. Who? The hardest, most ruthless criminal we know. Hi, Mickey! Hey, Mickey. Kids, what a nice surprise! Nice gig. Yep. The ""Queezy Queen."" It's good honest work. Pull the lever, push the lever, ""you have to be this tall,"" and that is it. Uh-huh. Yep! Just push and pull. Very Zahn. You mean ""Zen""? Zahn. Steve Zahn. He's an actor I admire. Love that guy! Hey, Mickey, uh, can we talk to you in private for a second? Sure, sure, sure. Step into my office. Like it? You guys comfortable? Can I get anybody a water? We're good. Mickey, what would you say if I told you somebody found something I'm in. Hold on. There's more. Oh, great. So, there's this thing that comes out of whales' butts called ambergris. It's illegal to buy and sell. Enter, you. Okay, gang, I'm intrigued. But I don't know I left the criminal life behind. Good for you. I used to be a thumbsucker and then I stopped, so I get it. Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey! Come on, man. It's one last job. This is my last job. This is my last job moment. This is the one I do and then I die or go to jail at the end. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! This is the one you do and then you are golden. Oh, okay. If I help, I'd get some kind of finder's fee, right? Maybe, like, uh I don't know, ten percent? What?! I mean yeah, sure. That would help me buy my bar. I want to get a bunch of monkeys. Call it the Monkey Bar. Or ooh or crows! I could call it the Bar with All the Crows. That's beautiful, Mickey. I love your dreams. Oh, I got to go, I got to go. Sorry, kids! Bonus round, right? I'm back! Felix. Hi. Are you here to tell us the plumber is coming? To fix the hot brown water? No. Because the hot brown water is just the tip of the hot brown iceberg. I was just about to call the plumber. Then I thought, ""That's thinking small."" Calling a plumber is thinking small? Tiny! We're gonna give your bathroom a total remodel. Oh! Wow. The bathroom's fine. It's just the water that needs to be not brown. Yep! A total renovaciÃ³n! My brother will flip. He'll be like, ""Whoa!"" And I'll be like, ""Yeah! Calvin! I friggin' did it!"" And then he'll be like, ""Oh, that's nice."" Um So where is the latrine? Let me see it. Over there. It's-it's over there. Oh, God! It's horrible! It's not that bad. Wait, let me look at it one more time. - Oh, my God! - Oh! First, we're gonna tear everything out. Yeah! Then we're gonna burn that sad little poop corner to the ground. Yeah, burn it! Oh. I don't think that's Burn, baby, burn! No. And, in its place, we will build a bathroom where anything can happen. Babies will be born! Aw, babies. All right. Men will die! They're gonna die. Maybe just fix the plumbing and then do the It's a new day, people. It's a new day. You can't hurt us again, bathroom! Never again! Oh, my God. Sleep tight, little ambergris lump. Good night, ambergris. Mmm Gene, no licking! Hey, what?! The lump made the first move! I'll tuck it in. Ow. Everyone say good night without touching it or licking it or hurting its value on the black market. Say good night! Good night. Good night. Okay, now walk away. Ambergris, I'm gonna eat some old cheese, but I'll be thinking of you. What? Who's there? What's that? Pretty, pretty, pretty. Thirty. Thousand. Dollars. Thirty. Thousand. Dollars. Put it on the boat, Hovig. Put the tile on the boat. Hovig, calm down. You know me; I'm not gonna burn you on this. Ho Talk to him, Linda, please. Hovig, listen to me. He won't burn you. Wait, wait, who's Hovig? Felix, how long is this gonna take? We need a bathroom. Some people come here just for the bathroom. And I say, ""Customers only,"" then they buy a soda. Bob, shh, it's the tile guy, come on. Okay, if you could just give me a ballpark of when this will be done Okay. Thank you, Hovig! I love you, honey! She's great with Hovig. Did you sleep at all last night, Louise? Sleep? Ha. Soon I'll have people who do my sleeping for me! Bob's Burgers! Whoa. Louise, it's Mickey! Oh, hi, girl who sits behind me in math class. What? No, no, it's Mickey! Brown hair? Hands a little bit small, out of proportion with his body? Yeah, yeah, what's the good word, math class friend? Oh! You're being discreet. I should do that. I found somebody to move the ambergris! You did? Who? You're not gonna believe it, the fried dough guy. He works right near the Queezy Queen. Really? You found someone at Wonder Wharf? Uh, don't be alarmed but pretty much everyone working at Wonder Wharf is a criminal. Even Sally the snow cone lady? Are you kidding? Especially Sally the snow cone lady. Okay. Well, let's go see your guy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, compadre. I-I got to wait till my next break. Can we say 3:00-ish? You want to meet here and then we'll head over and see the Nose? Who's the Nose? That's my guy. He's got an amazing sense of smell. Oh, that's why they call him the Nose! I just got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And? Well, he can verify the ambergris, and if he likes what he smells, he'll buy it off you right on the spot. Ten percent to me, we go our separate ways. Or hang out! I don't know what you guys are up to, but I'm just Gotta go. Wait for further instruction. Bye! Kids meeting. Upstairs. Now. We've been having a lot of kid meetings. This is why we need a conference room. Mickey told me the name of his connect and where he works, so it's sayonara, Mickey! What are you saying, Louise? We're cutting out Mickey? He cut himself out by giving us the information. It's not my fault he's bad at being a criminal. But Mickey was gonna use that money to go straight. He was gonna open that straight bar. Okay, Tina, you're too emotional. You just bought yourself a ticket to Not-Goingsville. Gene, let's go. Here, I'll hold the lump. No way, Gene. I've seen how you hold it in your mouth. It needs to be stored at mouth temperature! You know what? I'm going alone! I'm taking charge so you two won't screw this up! You want to end up like Mickey? Five-foot-ten? Comfortable in his own skin? No! Cut out! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! Aah! This stuff is making you crazy! It's tearing us apart! Why couldn't that whale have pooped three equally sized poops like I do! This isn't like you, Louise. You used to be nice, sort of. If you're gonna sell that thing, then you're doing it alone. Yes, that's the plan. That's exactly what I'm doing. Wh-What are you doing? You don't walk into a deal just holding the stuff. You tape it to your back. Watch a movie! Okay. Let me get that for you. Thank you. The tape doesn't stick. Stay still. I'll get the duct tape Dad uses to lock the front door at night. It's ready. Ambergris lump secured? Check. Sample for The Nose to test? Check. I'm leaving here a girl with a hunch on her back, but I'm coming back a girl with a whole hunch of money. I'm mad, but I'm still gonna wish you good luck! I got the deejay Yay! Ah, the unveiling party; It's gonna be amazing! Unveiling party? Party time! We don't even have a bathroom that works, and you're planning a party? By the way, the deejay might have to stay with you. What?! Yes. He's Brazilian, though, so, uh very cool. No Felix, no. The burlesque girls, you know what, let's just have them dancing on the tables and the counter. Oh, burlesque girls! Classy! Very classy. Please, sir, don't encourage this. You're not in You know what? What? You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna have a plumbing party, all right? With a licensed plumber. To fix the bathroom. Not a deejay, no burlesque show. Okay. A plumber to fix the pipe! Bobby! So no girls, then? Or still girls? It's still happening. I'll put you on the list. Fried dough? Are you The Nose? That's what they call me. What do they call you, Humpback Whacky Eyes? Listen, doughboy, I came to talk to you about real dough. Ah, I see. You're, uh, you're early. And you're, uh, rather tiny. Yeah, yeah, I'm a little girl. Sorry I'm not huge and old. Wh-Where's Mickey? Uh, Mickey sends his regrets, and, uh, this hearty handshake. Ugh! You put something gross in my hand! Oh. Okay. Sweet Georgia O'Keeffe! This is finely aged. You have the rest of it with you? Well, do you have the money? I want $30,000! Well, I don't have it on me. Then I don't have the stuff, Do I, Nose? Oh, you know what? I just remembered. I want to the ATM yesterday. I have about $30,000 on me. Okay, great, great! Let's do this. All right, count of three, I give you the money, you give me the ambergris. Sounds good. Okay. One Okay. two three! It's huge! Oh, is it? Are you robbing me? Yeah What?! Mickey's not here. You're very small. It just makes sense. Yeah, okay, I get it, I get it. But what if I do this! Nope. Doesn't work. Remember? You're small? You have to give it back! Mmm, hey, this smells like a cantaloupe wrapped in dirty socks. It's a cantaloupe wrapped in dirty socks! Tina! Stay still. I'll get the duct tape Dad uses to lock the front door at night. Dear Louise and/or The Nose, this is for your own good. Also, please return the cantaloupe and the socks. Love, Tina. You know, they're not that dirty you can get another day out of these, quite frankly. Okay, okay, okay, if I were a double-dealing goody-goody with a treasure, where would I go? Is this a riddle? No. Kid's book? No. And I wasn't talking to you, Nose. Sorry! Don't you have some dough to fry? Easy there, Blinky. I don't have dough to fry; I get to fry dough. This is a dream job. I never realized sinks could be so sexy. Oh, yes sinks are the supermodels of the bathroom, as I like to say. Yeah! I call this one ""Sinky Crawford."" Sinky Craw Do you? Yeah. Do you? Yeah! That's great. That's so great. Get it? Sink Ha-ha-ha-ha! Like Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha. Ha! I am so sick of your attitude. Oh, yeah, it's my fault. Come here, Bob Bobby, wait, I didn't mean that. Bobby! Oh, my God!  Look at this one!  Oh, yeah! Hubba hubba. Are you sure we should do this, T? Yes. I know how we can still use the lump for good. Mickey can sell it and open his bar. The bar with the monkeys and the crows! It's what the world needs now! Don't worry about that sound that's nothin'! That one, ooh, that's new. I got to report that one. Mickey Louise Hi. she's meeting with the Nose right now. Uh-oh.  Crossed wires alert. No. Louise cut you out. She cheated you. Ooh, that stings. But I'm giving you the lump, all of it. You can use the money to go straight. Buy a juicer it'll change your mornings. Or cowboy boots. Mm, change your evenings. I'm honored, and I accept your offer. And I know exactly how I'm gonna go straight. Yeah, your dream the Monkey and/or Crow Bar. Nope. I'm gonna use the money to buy a tank. Uh-huh And then I could use the tank Uh-huh. to rob a bank! Uh Oh. I'll be Mickey Tank-Bank! No! Yes! Mickey Tank-Bank! Aah! I shouldn't have come here! Why, whale? Why did you curse us with this poop or wax or whatever it is? Aah! There's only one thing to do: We have to destroy the ambergris. Whoa, hey, wait-wait-wait! I was just getting to the ""going straight"" thing. I'm gonna do that after the bank. Tina, where are you going? Oh, my God, there she is! Tina! Sister! Ah, my only sister, there you are. Hi, Tina. We haven't met yet, but I really want that thing you're holding. Everybody get back! I'm gonna throw the ambergris in the water. No! Whatever you do, don't throw it in the water. Anything but the water! Wait. Doesn't ambergris float? Oh. No! Aah! Stop her! She stole my baby! Seagulls! Swarm attack! Aah! I thought that would work. Hot hot pier! Ooh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Aw We got her. Nowhere else to go, Tina. Hand it over. I want that money! What? What part of don't you understand?! Huh-huh. Mmm, ah! It's for the best. Can I have the socks and cantaloupe back? I'll check in about it later. Everybody having a good time? I know you are! Can you drape it more casually? Like, ""Oh, I'm just a ribbon, no big deal."" Uh, sure, yeah. How's this? Beautiful. Hey so, I had a little time to think, and I guess I was a tiny bit out of control the other day, you know, with the, uh You know, uh, the ambergris. Huh. I didn't notice. Oh, seriously? No, I noticed. Oh. You were really, really out of control. I don't know, I miss twitch-face Louise. Well, Gene, that's what happens when you fry $30,000 in hot oil! There it is there's Twitchy. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm just twitching to the music. So, is this, uh, the unveiling? Yep. How's it looking? Haven't seen it. Not feeling great about that. Doesn't seem to matter to anybody. The deejay slept in my living room. - Bob! - Sergio. Hey, Mr. Fisch. Wine? Calvin. Welcome. Was it easy to get in? I left your name at the door. Not bad, huh? You know, I'm kind of glad the burlesque dancers didn't show. Heh! They didn't want to dance at a bathroom party. What are they, royalty? Anyway, let's unveil this baby. Okay, uh Oh, God, I'm nervous. The new, improved Bob's-Restaurant- that-sells-burgers ba-throom! Oh, my God. Oh my God. Which is the sink? Which is the toilet? I'd pee in that. Or that. It doesn't quite match the rest of the restaurant. Calm down, Bob. I didn't forget you and your concerns. So the water works? Oh, was that one of your concerns? Yeah. It was. Hold that thought. Calvin Hmm? what do you think? Do you love it or do you love it? What were my choices again? You hate it. No. You do. You hate it. You hate it, too, Bob, don't you? Yes, I do, hate it. You think it's stupid. Too gaudy. Too much black! Not all those things. You never support me! Felix, you're being dramatic. I'm not being dramatic! I just feel like I'm gonna throw up my heart and my head will fly away like a bird! So, you got your bathroom done. I'm gonna rip it all out! Mr. Fischoeder, can you do something about this? What, Felix? Oh. Yes. Step aside. Watch this. It's Felix, It's Felix, it's Felix, it's Felix, it's Felix, Come on, Bob. it's Felix, it's Felix  Who's that funny little wormy guy   Who poked out his brother's eye?

"Tina, good. Louise, eh. Gene, get the back a little. Back, back, up, down, side, side, go, go! And time. Brushes down! Yuck! What was that stuff?! Toothpaste. So that's toothpaste! All right, now hurry up and floss like you've been flossing every day for the past six months. Go. We don't have any floss. We all agreed not to get food between our teeth. Maybe Dr. Yap won't notice. Oh, he'll notice. Dr. Yap notices everything. He's like an eagle soaring through your mouth. You know, I think I'm gonna sit this one out today. Not so fast, Miss Missy. Those teeth are gonna get cleaned twice a year until Dr. Yap stops taking our insurance. Why do we even have to get our teeth cleaned? What kind of a racket is that? Louise, we know you hate going to the dentist, but come on, can we have this go smoothly just one time? Sure, sure. Let me go get my coat. She's gonna lock herself in her room! Don't make me tackle you! Got her foot. Damn it! Spotless, as always, Tina. You know, we don't always have to make this about business. I'm more than just a mouthful of perfect teeth. And off you go. All right, all set. I feel violated. Maybe a toy would help? Okay. You like that toy basket? Mm-hmm. Toy basket is what it's all about! Come on, cup n' ball, or pirate tattoo! Ooh! Ah, the old get-all-the-BBs into-all-the-holes game. A classic. I'll master this when I should be brushing my teeth. Gene, that's not really the idea. Bup, bup, bup. Bup. Got the toy, gonna go. Well, well, well. They haven't ripped up your dental license yet, huh, Dr. Yap? What's it made out of? Is it hard to rip? Ah, hello, Louise. Still afraid of the dentist? Afraid?! I'm not afraid! You're afraid! You reek of fear! - Whatever you say. - Scaredy-cat! Look, how about I just sit in that chair for the allotted time, flip through a nature mag, and you can still get your easy money? Nope. Ugh! Fine. But you're in and out in two minutes, or I start biting. No loitering! Scrape a gum, I slap your face, got it? I know the rules, Louise. You're the boss. Just in case you forgot. All right. We need you to open your mouth. Okay, now just, uh You're doing great. Just, the opposite of what I've asked you to do. Just open it. Are we done? Almost. Just Aah. There you go. Aah. Great, great. Perfect, tiny opening I can see through. Hmm. Ow! That was fair. That was fair. That was my bad. I didn't You need to talk to me! You're right. I know. It was my fault. I just You got real quiet! No, I know. Bob, we have a situation. Did Louise hit you? Yes, but that's not the problem. She's got a cavity. Wow. So, oh, Louise got her first cavity. Yeah, and it's a doozy. Oh, it's so bad. Look, I have a cancellation. - I can do the filling right now. - Boom, bam. Hmm. Yeah, maybe a surprise attack is best. This isn't gonna be easy. I don't want to go back in there. I really don't want to go back in there, Bob. Listen. Mm-hmm? You can do this. Yup. Yup. All right? Okay. So, I'll see you later? Yup. Yup. All right. I need to stretch out a little bit. Yup. You know, I'm just gonna do a little  trivial touchup on that second molar. What the hell's all that for? Um You have a Cavity. A cavity?! No, no, I'm not getting a filling! Hey, fill this! Hey! Hey! You back off! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Sorry! It's fun in there. It's fun. Here's what's gonna happen, okay? I'm going out this window, and that's the last you'll ever see of these teeth. Your parents will bring you back, Louise. You have a cavity. Let 'em. I'll keep running! Ho-ho, they'll never find me. - You're gonna wait ten - Hey! You're gonna wait ten minutes till you tell my dad I'm gone. This is sil I What did I just say?! Okay! All right! Ten minutes. I'm sorry. Adios, Yap! She's gone! She ran away! What?! She told me to wait ten minutes before I told you. But I'm a grown man, and she's a little girl, so I waited eight! You waited eight minutes to tell me my daughter ran away?! Don't tell Louise I didn't wait the full ten. Maybe she ran away into the car. Oh, no, she's gone. Oh, my God. Louise! Dad, you're scaring everyone. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Aah. Aah. Oh, I can't believe my baby ran away! We haven't found her yet, but we're going to. Aah. I don't know. She is pretty small when she crouches down. She could be anywhere by now, and in need of semi-urgent dental care! She could have fallen into a crevasse! Do we have those, Bobby? How deep are they? Oh, God. She has to come home. I mean, she's nine years old. It's not like she's thought this through. Exactly where I left it. Oh. Right. Candy cell phone. I was only seven when I packed this go bag. I guess I was just a kid back then. Hello? Louise, is that you? Are you dead?! Oh, I'm alive and well, and I plan to stay that way. And don't bother tracing this call, 'cause I'm not gonna be on long enough. Louise, honey, come home! Only if you call off that lunatic, Dr. Yap! Louise, it's your father. Just come home and get the stupid filling. Sorry, Dad, that's not gonna happen. So, uh, oh, geez, I guess this is good-bye. Not how I imagined it. What? Good-bye? What do you mean? We're your family! Well, Mom, sometimes these things just don't work out. Louise, don't No, Louise, don't go So, Ms. Black, you want to reserve the Duchess Suite for an indefinite stay, and you have one Mr. Bob Belcher's credit card. Now all I need to complete this check-in is an adult. Yeah. I believe this photo I.D. says I'm an adult. Yes. Yeah. It says you're 43. Mm-hmm. But it's written in pencil. And the background says ""Wagstaff School Picture Day."" Wagstaff was my platoon in 'Nam. Oh, man, they said there'd be people like you when I came back. Uh-huh. Serving my country, protecting your ass. I'm going to have to call the police now. What? So they can give you a ride home. Good-bye. Louise, what a surprise! I'm so glad it's you and not a murderer. Nope. Just me, as planned. Remember? No. Aunt Gayle, I wrote you weeks ago about staying with you. Oh, that darn mailman must be taking my letters! If that's his way of getting me to notice him, it's kind of working. You remember the cats? Do I? There's this one and that one. Oh, the-the other one! Oh, they like you. The farther they walk away from you, the more they like you. What's, uh what's going on with the plastic situation over here? Are you renovating your bed? Ah, I'm not such a good sleeper so I kind of invented this little game where I'm the last living person in the world. Oh. Does that help, or? Yeah! This keeps out the radiation and the mutant carnivores that prowl the earth at night, and I sleep like a baby. Okay. Well, that's great. I'm gonna go hit the can. Well, I'll just call your mom and let her know you got here safely. No, no, no, no, do not do that. My mom said for you to only call her if I don't get here safely. Makes sense. Mm-hmm. In case I have to keep running, Cuba's that way. I can just take a Ow! Ow! Ow! Suck it up! Hello? Gayle, it's Linda. Hey, Lin, it's me, Gayle. Yeah, I-I know, hon. I called you. Oh. Okay. Listen, have you seen Louise? Yeah, she's here at my place. Oh, thank God. Bob, she's at Gayle's. Yeah, it's that scheduled visit I didn't know about. She ran away, Gayle. Oh, my. Where'd she go?! She's at your house, hon. Oh, right, right. She's afraid of the dentist. She got a cavity, and she doesn't want to get a filling. Well, who does? Okay, well, uh, we'll come pick her up, but don't tell her, or she'll run. Oh, good thinking, Lin. You're the smart one, I'm the hot one. No. That little dental dodger. How come Louise gets to run away? She doesn't get to run away. I want to run away! Yeah, I could stand to run away. It could be chapter four of my memoir, ""Going to the Dentist."" No one else is running away. We just need Louise to get that filling. Good luck with that. Maybe it's time for a little creative parenting. Wait. What do we do, Lin bribe her to get the filling? Bribe Louise? We don't have that kind of money. But if she lost a bet I don't know. What's the bet? Pack your bags, kids. You're running away, too! Yay! Yay! What the? What are you guys? Guess who else is running away. Us. Gene and myself. What about Mom and Dad? They dropped us off. I'm not coming home! I know. Stay at your Aunt Gayle's! Great. I will. Forever. Thanks. I bet you can't last the weekend without Gayle driving you nuts! Bet I can. I love it here! Yeah, care to make a wager? Sure! I'll tell you what. If you last the whole weekend, you don't have to get the filling. But if you crack, if you can't hack it, you get the drillin' and the fillin'. Deal? Of course it's a deal! I can stay here till I'm 30! It's the most fun studio apartment in the world! This better work. It's gonna work 'cause we're gonna cheat. We got a man on the inside. ""Hi, Mom. Ready when you are. It's Tina."" ""Tina, your daughter, Tina."" Okay. It's time to text Tina her first instructions. We're gonna raise Gayle's crazy meter to un-fun levels. Super secret-style, like a ninja. You know, this whole situation is absurd. Hey, you got to fight crazy with crazy. Well, Louise gets this from your side of the family. You don't think I know that? What are you doing? Stop that. Go in the hole, BBs! Aah! I was so close! What do you have against novelty amusements, cat?! Hi, Aunt Gayle. So, um, we were wondering if you'd read us your poetry. Uh, what? Really? What? You kids want to hear my poetry? Tina! Oh, wonderful, wonderful! What's happening? ""Happy Things We Should Send Into Space."" A jar of mayo. Magazine clippings of Scott Baio. That song that starts with ""Day-O"" Little cat, you're just like me. You go outside and squat to pee. Squat! Squat! Squat! Squat! Yeah!  Okay. That's Oh, ah we got to stop. But I'm not done. Squat! The end. Great poems, Aunt Gayle. Okay, I'll take that. Thank you. Wait. But I have so many more! And I want to read them! Later. Alone. So I don't disturb anyone when I go, ""Mmm. Uh-huh. Well put. Devastating."" Oh, poopsicles! Louise outflanked us. I think we got to turn up the heat. You know, I haven't read any parenting books, but I'm pretty sure this wouldn't be in there. Parenting books? There are parenting books? Um I thought they were that was a joke. Well, there are parenting books. Huh. I should write a book. I'd call it Hey, You, I Saw That. Put It Back! That's Yeah. Yup, you should do that. I know, right? Make a fortune. Mm-hmm. Hey, Aunt Gayle, do your cats' claw caps come in other colors? What, their Pretty Paws? Of course! I got lots of colors. It's just maybe Jean Paw'd Van Damme would be happier in pastel colors. It is spring, after all. You're so right. Oh, Pink Eye and Mr. Business, you must be so embarrassed that you're still in winter colors. Let's change 'em up! We'll all help. Yeah! If we all pitch in, it'll only take a few hours. I'm sure you guys got it covered. I'm just gonna go Cat nail salon! Louise, you hold Mr. Business. Hurry, hurry. Why do I have to have Mr. Business? He's the worst one. Gene, you-you switch with me. Hell no. Oh, yeah. Oh, wrap 'em up with these towels, 'cause when we take the old Pretty Paws off, they tend to go for the eyes. Ah! No, just round 'em up. Just close your eyes and dive on 'em. Thanks so much for helping, kids. Now that I made 'em all pretty, the pound will have to give me that fourth cat. Ah, time to get some shut-eye. The apocalypse is upon us! Why?! Why must the world end right when I'm getting sleepy?! What's happening? Oh, it's how she sleeps. Don't worry about it. But there is an apocalypse. Ah! Every human is dead except for me! Especially the men! So there's no men! So it's okay to sleep alone. Good night, kids. Night, Aunt Gayle. Gayle had 'em in the cat salon for hours. Well, Louise has to be cracking a little, right? But we need to push her over the top. Hmm. Wait, wait, wait. Remember when Gayle hosted a game night and made us play the board game she invented? Gayle Force Winds? Yes! Gayle Force Winds! We should get the kids to play that. It's horrible. The rules don't make any sense, it takes all day to play it Yes! Gayle Force Winds will drive Louise nuts. All right, sex time! Oh, my God, right. We can do that, 'cause they-they're gone. Yeah Let's do it. Yeah. Let's go! You want me to win. Yes, I did it! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha. Eh, hmm. So, what do you kids want to do today? You're looking at it, babe. Okay, great. How does butter sound for lunch? What, am I gonna say no to a butter lunch? Hmm. Hey, Aunt Gayle, I wish there was a board game that we could play that stimulates the imagination but that was too good for the major board game companies to even touch. I made a board game that stimulates the imagination but that was too good for the major board game companies to even touch! Oh, I got to make room. Uh, what's happening now? Why are you looking at me? I'm on the same moving couch as you. So if Louise makes it to tomorrow morning, she doesn't have to get the filling? Right. But if Gayle's craziness drives her out, she loses. Mm-hmm. And yet she wins 'cause her cavity will be filled. That's right. Pretty high-level parenting. Yeah. We know what we're doing, Teddy. Pretty badass. But what if Louise flies the coop and just goes somewhere else? Oh Whoa. You didn't even think of that, Bobby? Well, I mean, it's been You have no contingency plan in place? I Teddy, it's been mostly Linda's thing. So we'll, uh we'll stake out Gayle's apartment. Oh, a stakeout. That sounds fun! Hey! Get takeout for your stakeout. Huh? Maybe you could order steak, have a takeout-steak stakeout. I'll get the menus! It's called Gayle Force Winds. It's more than just a board game. It's about love and war and fantasy and plagues and fashion. Cool. So how do we play it? Princess Gayle must save the five realms of Worldlandia from the evil winds sent by the wicked sorceress, Rebecca, who thinks she's so cute. She lives upstairs. Louise, you go first. Uh-oh, you landed in Sponge'in Dungeon. You got to sit with this wet sponge on your head This game seems pretty weird. Maybe we should go home. I'd rather sit here with a wet sponge on my head all day than get that stupid filling. Nice romantic stakeout. What is that smell? Oh. Bobby, Linda, what are you doing here? Teddy? What are you doing here? I was just gonna park over there for a few hours and then, uh, I happened to see you guys were here, and I thought I'd just kind of Wait, are you crashing our stakeout? What? No. I brought pizza! Ooh, pizza. Hand it over. So what'd I miss? You guys taking copious notes? Can you can Do you mind both just scooting up just a little bit? A little more. Is that it? Mmm. That's as far as it can go? Should we all just move over to my truck? Teddy. Uh, you know what, I'm fine. I'll make it work. Can you mind cracking a window? Aw, man! I landed in Cold Sore-ia. Oh, that's hard. You can ask Tina for some of her magic ointment. But I clucked like an enchanted chicken for 20 minutes to get this magic ointment. I don't know Uh-oh. Your indecision has upset the Gayle Force Winds. Everyone has to start over! No! We've been playing this game for six hours and no one has even made it past the Cliffs of Huxtable! That cavity's really bothering you, Louise. What's it to you? Whose side are you on? Don't you want me to win? Stay cool. I'm on your side. Team Louise all the way. Why are you talking like that? Like what? This is how I always talk. Wait, now I don't remember how I talk. Is this how I sound? Never mind. Just help me get past Rebecca's monkey army. Oh Tina says Louise is losing it. Hopefully our little girl's about to snap. Yeah, let's hope it's soon. Teddy's apnea is making me sick. Oh, God. Thank God. That one was, like, six seconds. He's breathing again. I mean, how lo how long before you die? I did it. I made it through the weekend. I don't have to get the filling! I win, I win! Let's all celebrate with more sleep and no more talking. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm! Morning, sleepyheads. Oh, my God, did we sleep through the night? We sure did. Never slept better. Linda. Linda. Wha Did you know that you snore? What happened? Did we win? What-What's going on? It's morning. Damn it. That little bugger pulled it off. She beat us. That's not an option, Lin. She needs to get that filling or else her teeth are gonna fall out. Okay. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. We're gonna have to make our baby feel some pain. Oh, wow. Y-You did it, Louise! How about a victory breakfast of ice cream? Thanks, T, that's a great idea. My baby! Our baby! We had to do it. It was the only way! You gonna finish that? Make it stop, make it stop! Knock, knock, time to pick up some runaways. Ow, ow, ow, , no, what's wrong, Louise? ow, ow, ow. She ate a bite of ice cream, and I guess it upset her cavity. Aw. Louise couldn't handle her high. Why-why is Teddy here? Yeah. Why are any of us here? Think about that. Whoa. You kids got further in Gayle Force Winds than I thought you would. Wait, you knew we were playing Gayle Force Winds? Ow. Um, I-I didn't. I just, um What-What's, uh what's Gayle Force Winds? Oh, now I get it. You guys were behind all of this. You cheated! How could you?! Ow! Tina helped us cheat! What?! Mom! Sorry, it's true. We cheated because we love you, honey. Yeah. Oh, that is disgusting. I hate you guys right no I can't believe it. Louise, you got to get that filling. I'm fine! Ow! Honey, now you listen to me. I know you're afraid. I'm not afraid! Oh Aw, screw it! I'm afraid, I'm afraid! I know a little something about fear. You've seen my life. Yeah. It's bad. So why don't you let Aunt Gayle help you get through this, okay? We're gonna turn your fear-believe into make-belie. That's not gonna work. Let's do it. Great! Now, what character do you want to play? You've been briefed of the situation. I have. This is the asset I spoke about. Is the asset willing to do whatever's necessary to save the universe? She is. And the asset promises not to bite me during the procedure? The asset promises. Then why the hell are we out here wasting time, damn it?! Let's go! Let's men! Sector eight, clear! Sectors ninend ten, clear! Ow. That pain is a toxin from our enemy's ice cream serum. The antidote is in this needle. Ooh! Oh Ooh, I don't know Okay, no! You must. The whole universe is counting on you, kid. Proceed. Ow! Very good. You should be completely numb in just a few seconds. Now, this might look like ordinary porcelain filling from a sad, lonely dentist's office, but this is a microchip of our plans for the most amazing weapon system ever. Oh, wait. Wait a minute. Oh, no! Our enemies are here! Ah! Louise, the mission must go on. Do it! Get him! Cover me, Bobby! Go, go, go! Grenade! Ah! Flamethrower! Okay Okay, all right, all right. I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm taking fire here! You got to call in some air support! This is crazy! We get the point! Geez. We got you. Okay. You may have shot me too many times, but our cause will never die. You did it, Louise. I did it? You did it. And it didn't inconvenience anyone at all. I'll hug him back to life! Okay, I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, Tina, he's fine. Don't do that. Okay. No. Almost there! Tina, let-let him go. Almost there! Tina, get up. When you get to the toy basket, get the squirt ring! The squirt ring! The future depends on it. Hey, you were good in there. You, too. I'd do a mission with you anytime. I hate to say it, but I think Gayle out-parented us. Maybe we should let her watch the kids more often. Oh, maybe Gayle could move in with us, be our full-time nanny. I'm gonna call your bluff on that. Yes. No. No, no. Too late. It's done. - See you at home, Gayle. - Gotcha! ""Happy Things We Should Send Into Space."" A jar of mayo. Magazine clippings of Scott Baio. That song that starts with ""Day-O."" Little cat, you're just like me. You go outside and squat to pee. Squat! Squat! Squat! Squat!"
"That's weird. Someone took  the mop part off this mop. Oh, my God. No! Sorry, Dad, I took it. I'm going out for cheerleader, and I needed some practice pom-poms. Oh, Gene, for my other pom-pom, I borrowed your Rasta wig. Not cool, mon. It's okay. So, Tina, you're going out for cheerleader! That's exciting. Yeah. At wrestling matches, cheerleaders are only ten feet from the action. When things get sweaty, that's the splash zone. I-I don't know. Isn't cheerleading kind of, well, silly? Plus, do you really want to get splashed by that? Yes. Oh. Don't you? What are you talking about? Cheerleaders help the team win by jumping around and touching their toes and asking if you're ready and then they say, ""Okay!"" And they whip the crowd into a frenzy by spelling words. W-O-R-D-S! Words! Lin, you're talking like you were a cheerleader. What? I was! Well, my best friend Monica was. So I was right there in the entourage. People were like, ""Hey, let's go to cheerleader practice."" And I would be like, ""Okay, I'll drive you."" Tryouts are today. I didn't want to tell you guys till I felt ready, so I've been practicing in my closet. Tina, do you really think you're the cheerleader type? Bob, be supportive. Come on, what cheer you gonna do for the tryout? Let's go, ignite, the Wagstaff team is dynamite. Okay, we're ready. Let's hear you do it. I just did it. Oh. Oh. Of course you did. Tina, honey, if you don't make it, it's okay. In fact, sometimes cheerleaders are not the nicest people. What? My friend Monica one time, she ditched me at the food court to hang out with the other cheerleaders. I had so many free samples of sesame chicken, I can't eat it to this day. You ate sesame chicken last night, Lin. I know, but I didn't like it. Damn you, Monica! Oh, my God. Okay! Gene, Louise, why don't you go to tryouts to support Tina? I'm sure she could use it. Okay. Oh, no way. I'm busy. By the way, with a cartwheel, are your hands or your face supposed to touch the ground first? Actually, I'll make time. We are the Whalers! It's true! We're gonna sink our hooks in you! Whalers! Oh God. - Great job. - I hate cheerleading. Her pom-poms make me want to vom-vom. She's in my math class and she makes me sad. I scored her a 4.7. We don't have a point system, Todd. I use a personal point system. Oh, great. Next! - Hi, I'm Tina. - Yay, Tina! Go, Tina! Tina's a wee-na! Let's go, ignite, the Wagstaff team is dynamite. Now the big finish. Ah! Ah! I'm okay. I just bit my tongue. Nailed it! Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina! He's got spirit. I hear it. Okay, I'm done. Gene's the Belcher we should get on the squad. Wait, I'm the Yell King here, and I got the guy stuff handled. I mean, is this a cheer squad or a male revue? Let's chat with Gene. Oh. But Tina was the one that was trying out. That's okay, Gene. At least I didn't embarrass myself. I don't even understand her. Gene, what do you say? Are you in or are you in? Mm, I don't know. I've got a lot going on after school. Clearly. I-I'm surprised he even made time for us today. Yeah, you'd have to offer me something pretty sweet to compete with my afternoon bath 'n' snack. Well, there's attention, popularity Got it, don't need it. Silk cheer shorts. I'm in. Yay, Gene's a cheerleader! The prophecy has been fulfilled! Bob, here come the kids. I'm sure Tina got bad news. Just don't overreact. Why would I overreact? I'm the one who thinks cheerleading is silly. Listen, you can be a little insensitive. Just follow my lead. Tina flew too close to the floor and hit her face on it swollen tongue. It was so much easier in my closet. Oh, my God, sweetie. Aw, your poor tongue. Who cares if you didn't make dumb old cheerleader, right? You know what? They can Oh, my God! Gene's a cheerleader! He's a jo Bob, Gene's a cheerleader! So, Mom doesn't seem to care. Oh, God, how'd this crazy, wonderful thing happen to us? Shh. Just take it in. I'm a cheerleader mom! Oh, I can't stand it! Um, obviously your-your mom is very proud. Uh, just like she's proud and sensitive about all you kids. Right, Lin? What? Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, Tina. You want to suck on a bag of frozen peas or something? Yeah, that'll help. I'm sorry, I can't understand you. Come here, Gene, oh, Gene! Ooh, let me wear your jacket! Oh, no, it's too small; let me put it on my shoulder. Look at it on my shoulder. Geez, Tina, that looks bad. The nurse said the swelling will go down in a couple days. I'm not really getting what you just said. I said the nurse said Still not getting it. The nurse at school said Eh You know what Tina needs? An interpreter! An interpreter? Oh. How about me? I'll do it. I'll be your interpreter. No. I'm hearing ""Yes."" No. ""Yes,"" we got that. ""Yes."" No. And she says ""Yes."" No. And she says ""Yes."" No. And she says ""Yes."" Well, looks like you've worked it out. Listen up. We're all here because we wanted this more than anything. Except me I wanted to advise Drama. But no, Ms. LaBonz got Drama and I got sis-boom-blah! Stop yelling. Anyway, what I am going to do is inject drama into cheerleading, with you as my stars! Hmm? Gene, you're the new kid. The raw rookie. Still breaking in your cheer shorts. Your arch rival is Todd. He is? Yeah, the bitter, boozy old Yell King. And, Todd, you hate Gene. He threatens everything you are! Already there. What about the rest of us? I don't know, let's go around. Who do you hate? Mm, I feel that I hate Jocelyn, because I'm the hot one, and she's the not one. Whatever. Tammy farts when anyone lifts her and it's gross! It's only when someone lifts me wrong. Okay, let's go with the Gene-Todd thing. You'll never be more than the bottom of my pyramid. I'm here to cheer. Get used to it! So as Tina's official interpreter, I'm gonna have my hands pretty full, and that means no homework, unfortunately. I don't know, Louise. Frankly, this sounds like a scheme to miss class. Yeah, I think so, too. What's she saying? Oh, she said she needs me. I didn't say that. And ""I have a disability, you insensitive creep."" What ""Give me Louise or I will haul your white ass into court!"" Okay, okay, okay! Settle down, Tina! Whoa, you're upsetting her. I've never seen her this angry. I Tell her I'm sorry. She can hear. Oh. I Sor ry. So you like the new you? Twice the spunk, half the junk. But you're not really interpreting. Hi, Tina. Hi, Jimmy Jr. You look handsome today. Yeah, she said, uh, ""Keep walking, dance man. Take a hint and a breath mint."" All right, that is really harsh. Wow. Okay, Tina. Be that way. The claws are out, huh? Good-bye. That's it! Louise, you are not my interpreter anymore! You're fired! Um, okay, so, if you're trying to play hard to get, it worked. You want to go out Friday? Okay, you can be my interpreter. W-A-G-S-T-A-double-F! Wagstaff! Gene, shoulder lift Tammy! Well, don't squeeze, newbie! Don't breathe in, you'll die! That hasn't been proven 100%. Gene, two-man pyramid! Now! Whalers! Great, Todd, re-hydrate. Come on. Sit. Hwah! Oh, no! That's my funny bone! Which is what I call my penis! Eh, you're hurting it! We're number one! Also I have to go number one. Cheer break! Hurry back. Gene, now's your chance to dramatically step in for Todd. I've been pumping him full of sport drink just so he would leave! Oh, my God, oh, my God! I don't know if I'm ready! You're ready! You have a cheer fire inside you and it's burning its way out! Okay. Squad, follow my lead! You can do it if you try! Come on, Zeke, pin your guy! He's gonna taste the sweet defeat when he sniffs your feet and seat! Cheer fire! Hey, the crowd's getting into it! I'm getting pinned! Oh, crap, I lost. I hate that! Look at Gene. Look at what he's done. Give me that! What did you do? What did you do? Just pee? That's right. Like a coward with a doodle? He doodled. He doodled! I didn't doodle, he doodled! I wouldn't Gene, Todd, please! There's a simple and dramatic way to handle this. A head-to-head competition in a public place with high stakes and arbitrary rules. Oh, my God, he's talking about a Cheer battle! Ah! I knew it, I knew it! Freestyle rules. Last cheerleader standing is the King of the Yells. It could go either way! I know who's gonna win. Your name is Gene, you've got heart and soul. I even like your haircut, but, hey, where is the bowl? Oh, no, I did that! Gene got bowl trolled! Okay, not bad. But here's the deal. I mopped up your spit, I rinsed out your towels, and when I hear you cheer, I evacuate my bowels! Ooh! Boom! Well, you've got no physique, you're kind of round. You make not very good mouth sounds! Huh? Ooh Hmm. Kind of a thinker. Good job, Todd. That was on the money. Who said that? Your rhymes are meh, your logic is flawed. If you're the Yell King, then I'm the Yell God! Oh-ho-ho! I think that was a death blow. I just got chills. No, no, no. Just give me it. Um You think you're smart, but you're stupid. Your cheers are just flivvity flovity flupid. Ska dee ba doo. That's not cheering, that's scatting. Get out of here, Steven Tyler! Ah, I give up! We have a new Yell King! Yeah! Todd, time to plot your revenge! Ah! Okay, here's your lunch, girls. Oh, Tina, for your lunch, I smoothied a tuna fish sandwich. Ugh. That sounds terrible. ""Yum! I love you, Mom. Make this every day."" Oh, and, Gene, here's your lunch, honey. Peppyroni Pizza, Chicken Pom Pom-adora and a Cheer-liter of soda. That's about 10,000 calories of cheer puns. Thanks, Mom. Bye. G! What? I was giving you a ""G."" You looked like you wanted one. G! Okay. E! N! E! Gene! Oh, my God, Lin. Well, I-I got to be going. Look, Gene, I can do a herkie. Ow! Uh, sorry. Lin, just let Gene go to school. No, let me do it again. Ow! - Bye, Mom! - I can do it better. Ow! Oh. I love you, my perfect little cheerleader baby! Hey, Tina. Hey, Jimmy Jr. Uh, ""Hey, idiot."" Ugh, I love it when she's mean. So have you thought about where you want to go Friday night? Wherever you want to go. She says, ""Pie in the Sky, ""the revolving dessert restaurant at the top of the Spinnaker Hotel."" She didn't say all that. You're right, I didn't. ""Yes, I did say all that."" No. Listen, it's not my first choice either, Jimmy Jr. Wait, you're coming, too? Yeah, I have to. It's work. When her lips are flappin', I can't be nappin'. You don't have to go. What'd she say? She said bring a lot of money 'cause we're gonna eat a lot of pie. Oh, man, I guess I could sell my bike. She's worth it! Super toe-touch, Tammy. Great buckets, Jocelyn. You! Nice job with the whatever that is. Todd, pal, how you doing combing out those pom-poms? Still some tangles. Mm-hmm. You're doing a great job with the squad, Gene. Gene is ripe for a fall, and you're the one who can do it, Todd! You mean work really hard on my cheering so that one day, I can Yeah, that's it, Todd. No, get dirty! So you want me to get dirty? No, that's not what we do here. Get dirty! Yeah, I'm gonna get dirty. You're telling me I lost my wrestling match 'cause of Gene's cheerleading?! He got the crowd on his side, Zeke, not your side. Yeah, the crowd perked up, and next thing you knew, the other guy's nad was in my eye. If only someone could convince Gene to quit the squad. Do what?! Maybe someone who had some muscle. Oh, I think I see where you're going with this. Yup, yup. I'm gonna tickle you! I'm gonna tickle you! Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going with this? Oh! Hang on, don't fall. What's that? It's a surprise for Gene. I designed a cheer stunt for his squad. He's gonna love it. Uh, Lin, do you think with Gene you're being just a little suck-uppy? Suck-uppy? I am not a suck up, and I don't play favorites with my kids. I love them all, even the ones who aren't special. Okay, it's just that Are you wearing a cheerleading skirt? No. It's something I picked up at the thrift store. It's a regular short pleated skirt with stripes on it. In royal blue. With a picture of a Viking. It's comfortable. Go team! Was that a cheer? No. Why would I cheer? My pep is pooped. All I want to do is eat a huge dinner and go straight to bed and get up later for my 1:00 a.m. cheese plate and then right back to bed. Gene, come look at my cheer stunt! Six cheerleaders sit piggyback on each other in a tower. Mm. And then they all roll at once in a giant cartwheel. Oh, oh. Whoops, whoops. No, don't-don't worry about that. Look, I made a flip book out of a sticky pad. Whoa! Ah! I call it the Pig Wheel. Get it? Huh? So you like it? That's a great idea on planet Crazy Cheer! We'd all die! No, no, look at the flip book. It's crazy, and you're driving me crazy! What? I'm just being part of your cheerleading. You're not a cheerleader, and you never will be! Oh, I knew it! You're just like Monica! I hope so because Monica sounds great! I wish I could have cheered with her! You! Forget dinner. I'm going to bed! But I'll still be up for the cheese plate! And we better not be out of toast points! Lin? You okay? Gene's not my favorite anymore! I'll go make his cheese plate. Hell-o. Hello. This is a warning! You quit cheerleading, or I'm coming back for the other nurple! Why?! Why?! Also, this isn't Zeke. This is someone else. And you can't tell who 'cause I'm wearing a jockstrap across my face. Got to go. Got math. Quit the squad! Look at this nurple! It's purple! Well, I didn't do it! Well, someone did! All I know is it wasn't Zeke! So I guess you're quitting. Keep in touch. I'll never quit, or keep in touch! Everyone quiet! I have a dramatic announcement. As a joke, I submitted a tape of this squad to the state cheer association. This morning, I got a call. Is that it? Is that the announcement, or is there? Oh, shh! I was pausing for effect! You've been selected for Regional Cheer Finals on Kingshead Island! We made the finals! Oh, my God, finals! I didn't even know about them, but now we're going! Oh, and it's tomorrow, and you need a brand-new, groundbreaking, original routine. Don't look at me. I'm busy! What?! Oh, my God, that's, like, impossible! To win in finals, we'd have to be ahead of our time. Or be from ahead of our time. What? We could be cheer-bots. In robot costumes with robot cheer moves. Beep bop boop. We will use our laser beam to annihilate your team. Mm-mm, mm. That is I can't make up my mind. It's either genius or crap. It's crap. Todd hates it. That means it's genius! Yay, cheer-bots! Mom, Dad! Come on, I can't be late! This is the regional finals! All right, keep your shorts on, Short Circuit. Hmm. Lin, come on. Be nice. Sorry, Bob. Still kind of miffed at Gene. Frankly, I'd rather be with Tina on her big date at Pie in the Sky. Poor Louise. She's probably feeling like a third wheel right about now. Ha-ha, look at me! The world is literally revolving around me! Okay, we have the pie-stravaganza party platter and three forks. Thank you, thank you, and that's my backup fork. Can I get some water? She said, ""We are barely revolving."" Let's turn this lazy Susan into a crazy Susan, okay? Um, it revolves at a speed that's designed for the comfort of our diners, so we can't really Jimmy, he wants ten bucks. Grease him. Oh, God, okay. Oh, I'll talk to my pals in the engine room. We want pies flying off the table, buddy. Oh! You feel that? Not really. Oh, yeah! Lovebirds, hold on to your nests! So, Lin, when cheerleaders compete, who cheers for them? Football players? What? I was I was making a joke. Bob, I don't believe it! What? Hello, Monica. It's Linda. Linda, I No. No, I'm going first, Monica. You hurt me a long time ago. But you can't hurt me anymore, Missy. I'm so sorry. I don't remember you. Ooh, that hurts. Ooh, that hurts! Oh, it hurts! Oh! Linda from high school. Do you have a child competing here? Yeah, that's my son Gene down there. Oh, my gosh. He looks just like you. Well, he acts just like you. A cold, unfeeling, dead-inside cheer-bot! Oh. So, uh, hey, I'm Bob. Guys, I think we got this thing. Yeah! We go on last, and so far there hasn't been anything half as good as Cheer-Bots from the Year 2525! And now, Melvin Laird Middle School presents the robot cheer team from the future! Beep, boop, gleep, glorp! Beep, boop, gleep, glorp! Melvin Laird stole our routine! Those are our semi-erotic robotics, and Melvin Laird stole them! Or someone here leaked it to them! But who would do that? Who would do something like that? Give up? It was me! Wha?! Why, Mr. Ambrose? Why? Because having your cheers stolen five minutes before you perform is incredibly dramatic! Now you really have to scramble! You are the worst cheer adviser. Someone burp me. Is that weird? I really need it. Louise, let's go already. ""Louise, more pie""? I may throw up, but let's roll the dice! No! Stop interpreting! This whole date has been about you, not me! Jimmy Jr., I don't know if you can understand me, but this is the date I wanted. We'd watch a movie probably 27 Dresses then we'd walk along the beach at low tide and find a cozy place to sit in the kelp and kiss. I heard every word, Tina. That's the same date I wanted, too. Except that movie I've seen it three times. So, that's 81 dresses total. Okay, I'm gonna be honest. I can't really understand either of you. Ow. Oh, now I'm definitely gonna be sick. It's okay. No one's gonna know who did that. Guys, guys, guys, huddle up. Maybe it's enough that we're robots from a different year in the future, right? It's not. It's over. There's one thing we can try. It's called The Pig Wheel. It's never been accomplished before except by stick figures. I don't want to be ""that guy,"" but if we do that, we're all gonna die a tragic death in front of our families. Stop, no, I never meant it to come to this! It's too risky! Do it! Do it! The person at the bottom might be crushed. I volunteer. No, Gene. We had our problems, but your passion and charisma are the reason we're even here. You deserve the top. I'll be the bottom. Then I went to college on a cheerleading scholarship. Mm-hmm. I was even was a professional cheerleader for a while. Well, my life turned out great, too! Yeah, I get all the hamburgers I want for free! And French fries! Show her, Bob! Uh, show her what? Well, sometimes you got French fries in your pockets. No, I don't. I d Oh, wait, there is one. Um, I-I don't know how that got there. Well, I'll eat it. It's pretty cool, huh? Pretty cool! Let's hear it for Melvin Laird! That routine definitely computes. Now up, Wagstaff! Hey, what the heck is that? I shouldn't have said I'd be on the bottom. Oh, my God, they're doing my Pig Wheel! I'm a cheerleader! Yay, Gene! You're my favorite again! Mama loves you, baby! Lin, this is crazy. Gene is way up there. There's no way that's safe. Okay, everybody, now we're gonna roll in a big wheel. We go on my count. One two That wasn't me! Oh, no. They're gonna fall. Gene! I'll catch you! I'll catch you! So many knees and elbows! Get off! Get off! Get off! Thanks, Mr. Ambrose. That was really, really sweet. Mr. Ambrose, you saved us! Why? Because five minutes ago, I started to really care about you kids. What a twist! The jaded cheer advisor has a heart of gold! Well, we still lost. Todd, if the judges saw what I saw, you're gonna win. So, last place. Mm-hmm. And you got a trophy. You get a trophy for last place? Yeah. At least no one was killed, right? Nope. So, that's also good. I don't care if I'm okay. Carry me off! It's more dramatic! Sorry, I said you weren't a cheerleader, Mom. I'm sorry, too, Gene. I was trying to cheerlead through you. And I still am. Here's a new stunt a pyramid of kids with a kid on top spinning another kid around like a windmill. Go on. I call it The Daffy Dutchman. Stop. Let's give it a shot right now. Squad! Mom, walk us through it. No! Ready. Okay. No! Man. Are we ever gonna get the check? Oh, hey look. Here comes my vomit again. Hi, vomit. We got spirit on our team! That's gr-reat! You got spirit on your team! That's gr-reat! Fight!"
"Come one, come all! Come on in! You! Look at me when I'm talking to you! Don't walk away, you coward! Hello, children. Why aren't you spending what little money your family has at Wonder Wharf today? We're supposed to be handing out these fliers, but no one's biting, so we were about to give them all to our old friend Gary Trashcan. You guys, we could give Mr. Fischoeder a flier. Looks like he's got his hands full with his own struggling business flyers, right, buddy? What? Struggling? The wharf isn't struggling. Ha, ha, ha. It's great! In fact, we're giving the whole park a facelift. And not the kind you give to decrepit old businesses, but the kind you give to hot, sexy, successful businesses. - You go girl. - Hey, listen, here's three coupons for one ride each. We've reopened the Scream-i-cane same thrilling ride without any lost limbs. One hopes. Aah! The Scream-i-cane! That's the idea! Yes! Aah! Aah! Aah! We'll take 'em. Hey, look.

Bob, I have a proposition for you. No. You haven't heard it yet. How would you like I wouldn't. to see this run-down old town turn into a thriving now town? No thanks. Wait. Felix, what are you talking about? I am in the midst of negotiations to sell Wonder Wharf and build high-end condos! It has a ring to it, right? Condos? Condos. Condos? Condos! We talking about condos here? Wait a minute. Sell Wonder Wharf? What does Mr. Fischoeder say about that? He says no, because he's a big dumb wiener! He thinks he can fix that wharf with a few ""renovations""? Does putting a Band-Aid on a fart make it go away? That doesn't make sense. Yes, it does. I don't know. Lot of memories on that wharf. I told Bobby I was pregnant with Louise on the Ferris wheel. He just kept screaming. I did. The wharf was where I won my first black light poster. Beginning of a lifelong love affair. The first body I ever worked on washed up under the pier. Little Italian guy. Strangled. Aw, sweet. You don't get it. What? They don't get it. High-end condos means rich people with money, which they will give to your businesses, so you can become rich. Well, when you put it that way, all right! I love condos! Yeah! Money, money, money. Yeah! Rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich. Hurray for money! Well, I don't see how we can help, and I don't want to help, so Bob, I don't think I've gotten through to you. Take a look at your specials board. Do you think these people appreciate saffron? Appreciate what you're doing here? What is saffron, Bobby? Uh, Mort was asking. I already know. Is it like a food thing, or more of an attitude? What if, on the ground floor of this condo development, there was an upscale burger place? You could call it ""Bob's Bistro on the Beach with the Burgers."" Ooh-la-la! Hello bah jour! I could make that happen. Hmm. You've described a secret fantasy of mine. I mean, a nice restaurant, upscale location. I wouldn't name it that, but I'd like to-to B-Bob, Bob, will you help me with something in the bathroom? What? Um, no. Uh, uh. Felix, I don't want to go, so And yet, here I am pulling you. Yes, you are. Linda? Bye, Bobby! The Scream-i-cane. We're going on it. Or hear me out we don't go on it. Ooh, interesting. I'll go on it, but only if you guys go on the carousel with me after. I want to go visit Mr. Goiter. You never forget your first horse love. Fine, we'll go on the Scream-i-cane, then the boring carousel with the freakish horse with a lump on it's neck. Yay! Hey, burger babies! Hey, Mickey. Three of your finest seats, please, Mickey. Gee. Sorry, Louise. You're too short. I can't let you ride. Oh, too bad! Bye-bye. Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, what's a couple inches between friends? Wouldn't be safe, and I also happen to be up for Employee of the Month. We get our pick of the stuffed animals, and I have my eye on a banana wearing Bermuda shorts. What?! Louise, let's just go. Come on. Oh, I hope you're happy with your shorts-wearing banana! Your only friend now, Mickey! Enjoy the park! Don't talk to me! Oh, Felix also bought me these. What? These. Blink, blink, blink. Y-Your eyeballs? The lashes. Oh, they're beautiful. Yeah, they're weasel fur. I knew it. Oh, and when the condos go in, Felix is gonna build me a recording studio. What? Also a nightclub. Oh. 'Cause I have a really good voice, so I'm gonna sing at the nightclub. I love nightclubs and singing! Sing me a song. Okay. She's gonna sing!  Who's that knocking on my door?   Ooh, it's Mister Dance Floor   Everyone is looking fancy   Things are about to get dancey.  Oh, my God, I just almost started dancing! Thank you! Yes, Bob's Burgers on the Beach sounds nice, but I still don't see what you need me for in all this. Also, I wish you weren't peeing right now. Look, Bob. God, I love this bathroom I built for you. I just do. Felix! Okay! I need you for a covert operation. you call Calvin with some reason to get him away from the wharf at 1:00 p.m. today so I can take the developers around. Oh, God. I don't like phase one. you work on him. Convince him to sell. Me work on him? Why me? He listens to you. Mm. You remind him of our father for some reason. Maybe something about that arm hair. He is always staring at it. Yeah. I understand why. It's exactly our papa's arm hair. That's pretty crazy. I Hi, Daddy. Um Too short? I'm not too short. I'm perfect! Hey, I know what this gang needs a trip to merry-go-round town. What? ""Carousel no longer in service""? ""Newer, better, less boring ride coming soon""? Let's take it down, fellas. Mr. Goiter! Whoa! Merry-go-down, am I right? Too soon. Please, Bob, just keep my brother away from the wharf for a couple of hours, work your arm hair magic on him, and you can have the beachfront restaurant you've always wanted. Oh, I don't know. This whole thing doesn't seem completely right. Bob's Bistro on the Beach with the Burgers. I still don't want to name it that. Do we have a deal? Okay, deal. But why are you doing that? Oh, I was just thinking of something from earlier today. Well, now I feel weird about this, 'cause you're laughing like that. No, no, no, it's-it's fine. You're doing it again. All right, come on, let's shake. Uh! Mr. Dance Floor! Ooh! Mr. Dance Floor! Wonder Wharf is open for business! Hey, you you don't look like you have a job. Come in! No! You bastards! Whoa. I just got a weird feeling. Well, I didn't wash my hands, so it could be my pee pee. Okay, so you're telling me that Felix gave you a covert mission to keep Mr. Fischoeder away from the wharf for a couple hours Uh-huh. so that Felix can take his developers around, get 'em interested. Uh-huh. And while we've got him, you have to somehow convince Fischoeder to sell Wonder Wharf? Yup. And we get a restaurant on the beach, and we all get rich? Yes. Great. Easy peasy. You think? Yeah. Aw, look at you, humble little burger man deciding the fate of the whole town. I'm not little. Little burger boy wonder. Ooh, I'm gonna make you a T-shirt that says that. I won't wear it. You will. So, a lie to keep Mr. Fischoeder busy for a few hours. Ooh! I got an idea! Mm-hmm. We call him up, tell him we're looking to swing, see if he's into it. Um, no? What? We're cute. Hmm. Oh! What about Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day? We tell him it's Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day? Yeah. Hmm. He does like lunch. He loves lunch. God, I'm hungry. Me, too. Let's eat first. Lady Big Nose, no! Oh! Oh! Mr. Down There Hair! Ooh! Aah! Henry Human Feet! His feet were more human than mine! Boss, I don't know what to do here. Listen, little girl, Mr. Fischoeder wants us to take down the carousel. No one rides it anymore. Possibly because they're put off by the deformed horses. This one makes me a little sick. I don't care about your facelift! Nobody touches Mr. Goiter! He's a hideous delight! Oh. Oh, man! Tina, got an idea! Be right back! Okay. Oh, no! Dr. Big Butt! Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day? Yup. And you want to go to King's Head island? It's your special day. Fanny, you want to come to lunch? Mm-kay! Hop in! Hi. Hi. How are you? Ooh, what'd you get? It's a skirt, but I'm gonna wear it as a dress so you can see my butt. Butt-dress. I like it! Butt-dress, butt-dress golly. Psst. Fanny, want to hear a secret? We're doing the plan. Hmm? Lin? Felix is planning to get Fischoeder away from the wharf. Lin? He doesn't have any idea. He doesn't have a clue. Linda, we can hear you. What? No. It's girl talk. They can't understand us. Oh, my God. Bob? Yes? There is no Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day, is there? Oh, maybe they can understand us. Little bit. Damn. I was really excited about it. - Landlords never get any fun stuff. - Aw. I just got a refill. What'd I miss? Well, the workers went on break, so I'm just taking a little breather. They're not on break. They're right there. What?! You said you were gonna sit with your lunch boxes and chitchat! We ran out of stuff to talk about. Well, I How about, um, like, what you did this weekend? Sorry, kid, but we got to do this. Fine. Just, let me say good-bye. Okay.  Good-bye, Mr. Goiter   I love you so much  Nice bike lock. It's Teddy's. He was hoping it'd inspire him to get a bike. Tina. What? Put your head right there. Okay. Hey! Oh. I wish I could have gotten in a more comfortable position. Now swallow the key. What is going on?! And that's how you lock your sister to a wooden horse! Yeah! Um, unrelated does anyone have any water or some pudding? So, as you can see, incredible ocean views, and a girl bike-locked to the carousel. What? I didn't say that. Okay, snow cones on me. Go pick out your flavors, go crazy. I'll be right back. Hi, how you doing? Greetings. Um, what are you doing? I've bike-locked myself to Mr. Goiter to save him. Yeah. Leave now, or I will make you leave. Oh, do you have the ability to make 13-year-old girls poop out keys? He might! Don't look in his eyes! This guy's trying to make my sister poop! No, I am not! Girl-pooper! Girl-pooper! Girl-pooper! Shut up! This is boarding school all over again! Boarding school sounds fun. So, Felix put you up to this, huh? Kidnapping me so he can show his developers around my wharf parts? No. Yes. Well, I want to go shopping. I want some new stuff. What? You can't just leave a kidnapping to go shopping. This isn't Florida. Bye! Shop! Yeah. So, you're probably mad. Not really. Doesn't matter. I'm not going to sell, anyway, ever. So, we might as well eat. Right? Uh, yeah. Oh, my God. I forgot my wallet. Ah! Imagine. Uh, you could cover and I'll get you back. You want to do that? Of course. Why wouldn't I pay for my own kidnapping lunch? All right. Bob's Bistro on the Beach. Bob's Bistro on the Beach. Here we go. Mr. Fischoeder, I know you said you weren't gonna sell ever, but if you did sell the wharf, you could I told you, Bob, it's off the table. Now, uh, what to talk about. What do you think of loose women? I like them. Mm-hmm. Mr. Fischoeder.  I know you're already a wealthy-ish guy   But think of what that condo money could buy   And I'd open up Bob's Beach Burgers and Fries   Oh, nice things are nice  Uh-uh. Not interested.  Your own private island   A million eye patches   No, I don't think so   A gold swimming pool   l to hold all of your cashes   No, sorry, Bob   I'd hire real waiters who all have mustaches   No, no, no, no, no, no, no   Oh, nice things are nice   Soon you will see just how nice life can be   When you start raking in condo people's money   Ooh, I love this dress, does it come   In size three?  Uh-uh. Okay, six? Uh-uh. Okay, ten?  Oh, nice things are nice   I'm chained to Mr. Goiter   La, la, la, la, la, la   In hopes that they don't destroy her   Okay, it's not a her, but I really   Really wanted it to rhyme   A legion of servants, all at your command   An army of tigers, like you always planned   I could buy my own missiles to launch at Engl  Never mind, I'm not telling.  My sophisticated burgers they would understand   Oh, nice things are nice  You guys. Excuse me. There's no singing in here. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Sorry. Sorry. Terribly sorry. Yeah. Thank you. Got carried away. So did you guys have fun? Uh, yeah. We, uh, shared a moment. I think. Or maybe not. I don't know. This is a disaster. Bob? Yeah? I don't know what it is about you, you bushy-armed bastard. Um But you've convinced me to sell Wonder Wharf. Really? That-That's great. Hooray! Hooray! All right! Have you ever tried brushing it this way? Like this? No, uh, but I will. It's a good look for you. Calvin, where have you been? What have I been doing? Just, you know, had myself kind of a chill-out day. You know, made a collage, skipped a rock. Felix, listen. You can tell your developers that I'll sell. Yah mo be there! Let's start calling the lawyers! What's going on over at the wharf? Oh, nothing, nothing. Lot of people. Are those news trucks? Hey. Don't worry about that. Look at me. Check this out. Here we go. Go down, and then my arms go back and forth, I lift my leg up and Why have you locked yourself to this horse, young lady? Well, um, he has a name; it's Mr. Goiter. Oh, there's my dad. Dad! They want to destroy the carousel. You have to help me stop them. Tina! Aw, you look so pretty for the news. Tina, I know you love the carousel, but I have to tell you something. They're tearing down Wonder Wharf to build condos. No! Uh, you weren't supposed to hear that. It's for the best. You understand, right, honey? Damn you all to hell! Yup, so great. They're tearing down Wonder Wharf? What if I grow? What rides am I gonna ride on now?! Why even grow?! And what do I do with I've been saving up for the Pontiac Solstice! Mr. Fischoeder, is this true? Are you selling the Wharf? Uh, yes, it's, uh Uh, Calvin, Calvin. Can I take this one? Hi, I'm Felix Fischoeder. The other odor. Listen, folks, once those wealthy condo owners start patronizing your businesses, your disappointing, fruitless lives will be full of fruit, because you will be rich enough to buy fruit. Yeah. Sweet condo-people money. That's right! That's right! That's right! That's right! Let's get their money! All right. Hey, I know you got a lot going on here, but, uh, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna cut out this pole, pull you off with a forklift, and hopefully, it's safe. What? What's happening? What's going on? What is happening? What is happening?! Tina! Uh Well, at least Mr. Goiter's okay. Tina, my precious baby angel! Tina, are you all right? No, I'm not! First Mr. Fischoeder wants to tear down the carousel, now you want to tear down the whole wharf? This place means a lot to a lot of people. What's wrong with you?! Okay, honey, you're hysterical. It's all right. Come here. Mama's gonna hug you back to normal. Come on. This park is like like the heart of the town. Shu-shush, shush, shush, shush. Shu-shush, shush, shush, shush. Oh, my God. You're right. Tina's right. I was gonna say all that stuff! You were? No, but you guys are getting so clique-ish! So you convinced Mr. Fischoeder to sell? Yes. To build condos? As in condominiums? Yes. Dad, I love you, but what the hell were you thinking, you idiot? Sorry, I love you. Oh, God, I-I got to go talk to him. No! The condos! The money! Hey, I got an idea, let's go get pretzels. Lin, I-I knew Felix was wrong, but I let myself get talked into it. I got to go fix this. Just be rational! Linda. Linda, let go. Linda, stop it. You're hurting me! Mom, let him go. Let him go, Mom! Drag her off me! Don't do it! No, you let him go! Don't you do it! Get her off! Nuts. Now, these condo people what percentage of their income would you say they spend on yarn? Oh, what a good question. Roughly 45%. That's not very high! Hey, Mr. Fischoeder, could I speak to you for a minute? In private? Yes. Please. These people keep talking to me. Uh, how about we go on a ride? Hey, I heard good things about the Scream-i-cane. Okay, what the hell. Come on, Gene. We're going, too. I told you, no roller coasters! The technology just isn't there yet! Now here's a question for you. Who likes nightclubs with a Caribbean theme and a 29-year-old singer who happens to be my girlfriend? It's me. Hey, Mr. Fischoeder. You're looking rich today, sir. Hey, we're with the boss man, Mickey, so lay off! Yup, safety second, that's what I always say. Stop us! Stop us! You're terrible at your job! We appreciate your feedback. I'm gonna die and I never got to see Hall & Oates live! So, you can't sell the wharf. Really? Yes. Great. Hey, I have some laundry here. Maybe I'll just throw it into you, big fat washing machine man. What? 'Cause you're wishy-washy! You just convinced me to sell the wharf. Look, Mr. Fischoeder, I was wrong. I got greedy. I don't feel good! - Good! - Yeah! I got caught up in having this nice place on the beach, selling burgers to Oh, God fancy rich people. Aah! Why did I think this would be a good place to talk?! 'Cause you're an idiot! Hmm. It always seems to get stuck here on the big hill. And then the limbs come off. Oh, God. Louise, is it over? Am I home on the couch watching The Closer yet? Yup. Aah! This episode takes place on the Scream-i-cane! Wow. It's beautiful. Are you going to try to kiss me? What? Well, you used to be straight, but who knows with Mr. Flippy Floppy? Mr. Fischoeder, listen. I thought I wanted nice things, but I don't even like nice things. I mean, look at this shirt. This is my favorite shirt. Ooh. That is so sad. Look, those condos would make us like everywhere else. The wharf is the heart of the town. It's what makes this place special. I mean, sure, it's run down, it-it's really seedy, it's kind of dirty, they don't pick up the garbage. Mm. But it's also great. Hmm. So, are they gonna chopper us out of here or Oh, God, off. Yes, off. We did it! I lived. I knew that rules didn't apply to me. I knew it! Whew! My pants are moist but not wet. Oh, that part's wet. Boy, it's been a long time since I've been on a ride; they're wonderful. Papa always said people like things that go up and down and side to side and jiggle all their stuff around. And mother sewed that on a pillow. That's nice. I'm never selling Wonder Wharf. What? Never! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you saying?! I'm not ever selling this wharf! What?! No, no, no, no, no! Damn it! Linda! Wha? I'm going on again. Me, too! And here I come, too. Clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop. Felix, what about my nightclub? Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny No! You're not getting any of this. Or this. What? Or even this. Thanks for saving the town, Dad. You're welcome, Tina. Thanks for reminding me what's important. Yeah, sure. Hey have you ever pooped out a key? No. Um dice. Mm. Well, okay, I'll figure it out. So, we really did it, huh? Well, I did it. You almost blew it. Yeah, but then I brought it all home, kind of heroically not to pat myself on the back, but Felix. There you are. Uh, sorry. I, uh I realized what you were trying to do was horribly wrong and is that a gun? Yup. It sure is. It's where I keep my bullets. Okay, well, I'm going to, uh, head out. No, no! No, no, no. Oh, he's doing that laugh. I don't like that. No. Are you thinking of something funny from earlier today? No! I'm laughing maniacally! Okey dokey. Glad you like this rotten old wharf so much, 'cause it's where they're going to find your rotten old bodies. Hey, hey. I-I don't think you have a rotten old body. Um, I think he's talking to both of us, right? No, no, no. Can't be. You're the old one. Look at your face. What? Shut up! You're both old and you're both gonna die! Oh, so you did mean both of us. Yeah. Quiet, please!  Wonder Wharf   Wharf of wonder   This won't end   Till Bob's six feet under   He wanted things that were nice   But will he pay the ultimate price?   Wonder Wharf"
"I am in the midst of negotiations to sell Wonder Wharf and build high-end condos. What does Mr. Fischoeder say about that? You work on him, convince him to sell. ""Carousel no longer in service""? ""Newer, better, less boring ride coming soon""?  I know you're already a wealthy-ish guy   But think of what that condo money could buy   And I'd open up Bob's Beach Burgers and Fries  That's how you lock your sister to a wooden horse. Yeah. I'm not ever selling this wharf! What?! Hey, have you ever pooped out a key? No. Um dice. Glad you like this rotten old wharf so much, 'cause it's where they're going to find your rotten old bodies! Oh, God. This is bad. Ow! These ropes are tight. This is really bad. There's no point in making us uncomfortable before you kill us, Felix. What happened to common courtesy? Stop talking! Keep being scared. Oh, just shoot us already, for God's sake. The suspense is boring me. What?! No! Don't. What are you doing? I'm calling his bluff, Bob. Come on, pull the trigger, you big baby. I'm not a baby! I'm a big boy! A big, dangerous boy! Baby. Stop it! Baby. Stop it! Come on, baby! Stop teasing him! I can't help it. He's incapable of doing anything right on his own. Stop saying that! I'm sick of it! Calvin Calvin, I've lived too long in your stupid, weird shadow to just shoot you. You're going to die slowly, tied to the pier you love so much. I-I don't love it. You see that way up there above your head? That's the high-tide line. That's where the water's gonna be in just a little while. I see. You'll watch the tide come in before you drown, which will give you time to think about how all this could have been avoided if you'd just stayed on track and sold the friggin' wharf with me! Oh, God. Now I have to kill you and inherit your stupid voting share and do what you wouldn't do. You'll just be some dead guy getting eaten by crabs, and I'll be Mr. Fischoeder! Me, not you! You'll be Calvin Crabs, the stupidest dead person in the world. Well said! Well, I-I just want to say, you are already the important Fischoeder to me, Felix. I've always felt Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob, I see what you're doing. I see what you're going for here, but I'm mad at you, too. Plus, you got to kill the witness. Everyone knows that. That is true. Don't agree with him! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get up there and start living my new amazing life as Felix Fischoeder, the condo king with a dark secret and a girlfriend! Okay. Oh, God. Please, Mr. Fischoeder, do something. I have kids! Oh, come on, Bob. Those kids aren't that great. Felix, come back! I will later. I'll see you when you're dead! Buh-bye! Help! Well, thanks to your father, we aren't getting any new condos in this dumb town. No new money and no Bob's Burgers on the Beach. Nope. Just back to our boring, crappy lives in this stinky, poopy, rundown, shanty town by the sea. Where is Dad anyway? I haven't seen him for, like, 45 minutes. Do you think he has a separate Dad pad? Maybe he's back at the restaurant. That's where I always picture him. Hmm, no Bob. Well, I guess we'll open up for dinner without him. Maybe he's out partying with Mr. Fischoeder, his new buddy. Big boys night out, I guess. We can have a girls night in. I have a great new nail polish I've been dying to try. It's called ""clear."" Sure, if you want to look like a prostitute. Fanny, there's my silly skunk! No! Get away from me! Get off! Sweetie, I know you're upset, but listen. I took care of everything. The condos are back on, all right? So, I will just put my arm around you thusly. Uh-uh! Fanny! I just said I took care of everything. So, I'm getting my recording studio and my nightclub? Yes! Damn it! I took care of it! Don't yell at me. Sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm Oh, God. You know, I'm having a stressful day. Don't care. Hey, let's, uh, walk around and see where that nightclub will be. Okay. How about over there? No! Okay. How about uh, you like that location? Mm mm-mm. Right. Let's look to our left now. I don't like any of 'em. Quit squirming around, Bob. Do you have worms? 'Cause I do, and you're making them crazy. I'm trying to get my phone out of my back pocket. I can't reach it. Mr. Fischoeder, you need to get it for me. Oh. All right. Ooh. Ooh! That's unfortunate. What is? Your butt. Oh. Sorry? Up here, you're okay, but down here, it gets bad. Okay, just pull the phone out. Okay. Flip it open! Really? You have a flip phone? Yes. It works fine to make calls, and that's what phones are for. Nonsense, Bob. Phones are for playing tiny games about fruit on. Just hit the call button, Mr. Fischoeder. It'll dial Linda since I called her last. Ah! Hello? She answered! Linda! Linda! Hello, Linda! Bob? I can't hear you, hon. Linda! It's loud. I think he's at a bar. I'm gonna kill him. Oh, what's that laughing? What is? Bob?! Linda, listen! Felix tied us up under the pier! Call the police! I think he butt-dialed you. Yup, that's his butt's voice. Dad, it's Tina. Are you at a party? Are there boys there? Bob, you're wasting all our minutes, so you better be out buying more minutes! Bye! I still can't hear you! He's pocket-dialing me again. Lin, don't hang up! No, no, no, no. Ugh! Try her again. Bob, I think we're coming off a little desperate. We are desperate! Bob, I'm putting your butt on ""silent,"" for once. Who wants ice cream? No! No, no! Ooh, that's chilly. That 911 operator did not like us, Bob. No one can hear us. They thought we were prank calling. Maybe we could text 911. Can that sad little thing text? Sort of. Oh, we could text Linda! It'll be hard, but let's try it. Yeah, it's hard. I can't really see what I'm typing. I'm just pressing on the phone. Wow, the tide is coming in fast. It's the same speed it always comes in. Don't blame this on the ocean, Bob. Hey, what are you looking at? My boobs are up here. Oh, sorry, babe. I There they are Milo and Otis. No, that one's Milo, that one's Otis.  Ding-dong, diddly, ding-dong, dong!  Mom, you got a text! You're blowing up! What's your secret? Maybe it's Jimmy Jr. texting you to ask you what I'm doing for the rest of my life. He's gonna be pretty disappointed when he finds out. It's from your dad. ""Help. I'm tired yo."" What?! Of course he's tired. He's so old. Your father doesn't say ""yo."" The only time he ever said ""yo"" was when he went to Tina's class for career day. Maybe that's not what he meant to type. Maybe it's autocorrected. Oh, yeah. Like that time I texted mom that I was super horny when I was really super hungry. Why would I be horny? I'm not an antelope. I wonder what his text was supposed to be. What if it was something that would make us all LOL? Well, let's figure it out. Should be easy. Dad doesn't know that many words. We got to get that phone. I'll try to get it with my foot. Oh, look at those nimble, hairy little toe-men go. What the hell was that? I think I took a picture, and I think I sent it. I hope you got my best side. I'm talking about my wiener bulge. Stop. Tina, are you wearing my bike lock as a necklace? Kind of? Well, it's very flattering. It makes your head look safe. Now he sent me a weird picture. Okay, you know, I'm starting to get a little worried about him. Let me see that. Just looks like a white blob to me. Look who's talking. Oh that's Mr. Fischoeder's butt. How do you know what Mr. Fischoeder's butt looks like? I have a photographic butt memory. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute. What's that thing? Could be a rope or maybe a breadstick? Ah, they stole my idea for breadstick ropes. I think I got it. I'm getting it up your leg. Grab it. Grab it. Oh, but it's all footy. Grab it! If it drops in the water, it's over! Fine. Okay, the autocorrect suggestions for ""tired"" and ""yo"" are up there. Now we match 'em up and see what makes sense. Maybe he meant, ""I cried, y'all."" Why is he now Southern?! Could it be ""I tried blow""? We were gonna do that together. Just once. Oh, my God! Teddy was right! I knew it! Wait about what? About the picture, the rope. ""Tired yo"" is ""Tied up""! Dad's tied up somewhere! He's in a meeting! And he's going to be there for a while. I hope this is working. I tried to write, ""Felix has us under the pier."" I'm not sure if I got it all, but it should be close. Hit ""send."" Are you sure, Bob? Are you going to yell at me again? Just hit ""send."" Okay. Oh, no! Oh, no! Aha! Well, who gets to yell at whom now? Oh, my God. Did you hit ""send""? Well, I hit something. Let's talk about something else. I spy with my little eye one large cloud shaped like a camel. Right there. Where? That one. That one, yes. Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, my God, who's got my Bobby tied up? Let's think. Who are Dad's enemies? Time, gravity, toothpaste Jimmy Pesto. Eh, Jimmy's got an alibi, which is, he is dumb. It's from Dad! It says, ""Fix got under seven seven,"" then a shrimp emoji, and the word ""Pierre."" Oh, God! Someone named Pierre's got him tied up, and he's force-feeding him shrimp. Okay, everyone, stand back! Help! Help! You have to pull yourself together! You have two children and a Louise to take care of! Okay, okay. Stop slapping me. Oh, no, wait one more. Wait a second. Guys, there's a restaurant a few blocks away, called Pierre's, and they serve shrimp and breadsticks. Breadsticks! They're all right. They're not great. Quick, Mom. Let's close the restaurant forever and go find Dad! Hang on, Dad. Here we come. And hang on, shrimp. Here comes Gene. Well, look at the bright side. With the water this high, we can finally go to the bathroom without being embarrassed. Oh, that's warm. Yeah. You doing that? I'm doing it. Okay, so, I'll do the talking. No, I'll do the talking, you do the roughing up. And I'll eat the shrimp. And I'll watch Gene eat the shrimp. And I'll look around for clues. But if any of those clues are shrimp, bag 'em and give 'em to me. Hello. Welcome to Pierre's. Table for what do we have, five? Yeah. We're not here to eat. We're looking for this guy. His name's Bob, and you kidnapped him! Let me at him! Give me back my son! I don't have your What are you? Please! All right, let me look at the toilet picture again. You got a lot of nerve, buddy. Ow! Ah, can't breathe. Seeing spots. Don't want to die. Wow, that guy really fainted. And barfed. I feel bad. He got really upset there. All we're trying to do is just talk to him. But he still gave me shrimp. And he said come back anytime. What a class act. Uh, well, what do we do now? Yep. Uh-huh. What is it? What is it? I think I know where Bob is. Where?! He took the chug boat out to Alcohol Island. These are drunk texts. I know 'em when I see 'em. Oh Look, here are 87 texts I sent to my ex-wife last night. ""I'm sorry I'm not sorry""? Well, Bosco was no help. We got to face facts. No one cares about Dad except us. And, really, it's just Mom. And me. And Tina. Time to split up and search. If we want to find him, we're gonna have to track him down ourselves. Does anyone have anything of his we can smell? I have his jeans. We all have his genes. No, I have his jeans. I cut them into shorts. Oh, come on, like you're not all wearing a pair of Dad's cutoff jeans under your clothes! Wow, wow, wow. I didn't think he'd go through with it. Where's your family, Bob? Why aren't they looking for us? I don't know. Maybe they didn't get our texts. Well, things are bad, Bob. Things are very bad.  I never thought this is how I would go   Ooh   Here under the pier tied to Mr. Fischoe   Der, but looks like Linda will be a widow   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Oh, bad things are bad   I fear that my Bob's in a terrible place   Maybe you'll find him inside   Of this vase   Maybe a lion is eating his face   Oh, bad things are bad   Maybe your Dad was tied up by a sailor   I'll help you look   After I pump this inhaler   Check out my pants, they are perfectly tailored  Oh, yeah. Nice. Thanks.  Oh, bad things are bad   Oh, I wish that Bob would come back   I could really use a big snack   Okay, it's not a burger but I'll just pretend it is   And maybe cry   I did what I had to, I have no regrets   I murdered my brother for power and sex   What's this weird feeling inside of my chest?   Why do you keep not looking at my breasts?   Oh, bad things are bad   Farewell, cruel world, looks like I'll die alone   If only you'd purchased a better cell phone   And now I'll never know who wins Game of Thrones   Oh   Things are bad!  At first it was kind of funny that Dad was missing, but now I don't like it. We could end up with just Mom. No offense, Mom. No, no, we need your dad. You kids are a two-adult, two-bottle-of-wine-a-night job. Ugh! Where the hell is he? He didn't just disappear. Oh, hey, look. There's Felix. We got to warn him his brother's in danger! Felix! Felix! Linda! What are you doing here? We got these weird texts from Bob. We think he's with your brother. You see? My-my daughter says that's probably his butt. Definitely. Definitely his butt. Look, okay?! What? I mean, look, I'm trying to be super friendly here, Linda, but I don't know where he is, okay? Linda, Linda, Linda. Bob and my brother are probably just, right at this moment, terrified What? gasping for What? Gasping for what? Cheese? You are sweating a lot, Felix. You are moist. You don't know how moist I usually am. You feeling okay? Uh ooh ah oh oh Well, Felix seems fine. oh uh Calvin! What have I done? I recognize that sound. From the phone call. He's here! Bob's right here somewhere. Hey, where'd Felix go? Why is Felix going down under the pier? I need him to pay for this hot dog. Do you have any money? How about you? Little one. How 'bout you, glasses? No? The pier? Pierre is pier. Bob's under the pier! Oh, my God! Uh, we need three pedal boats and hurry! Well, if you want a fast boat, you really want the turtle. I know it's counterintuitive Just get in! Now, you need to wear a life vest Move it, chump! Enjoy your time on the water. It's beautiful. Dad, if you're dying, don't! It's not your time, Dad! I want to put you in a nursing home next year! You've got to teach me to shave! Everywhere! Hey! someone's coming! Over here! Over here It's Felix! I knew it! Oh, no. No, no, no. No. I knew he didn't have the ball What do you want now, Felix? I'm here to save you! Oh. Hurry up then! Untie us! Right, so, just going to, uh shoot into the water to undo the ropes. No! No, no, no. That's a bad plan, Felix! Bad plan! Mm He's too chicken to jump in. Oh, my God, could you stop taunting your brother? Yeah, and I'm not chicken! I'm It's just the water's, uh, choppy. Bobby! Linda! Dad! Everyone quiet! I'm preparing to jump in and save them just, uh, need to mentally get ready here. Oh, come on! Someone, please hurry! Felix, what the hell is going on? I was gonna kill my brother so I could sell the wharf and get you your nightclub, but I-I can't do it. What?! I'm going in. Uh-uh, Felix. Nobody move! What?  Fanny, what are you doing? I won't let you ruin my dream. This is my time! All of my life, people have been telling me what I can't do. ""Fanny, you can't show your butt."" ""Fanny, you can't shoot people."" Oh, God. Shut up! I can't think. What else is new? Okay, Linda, you and the kids get off your boats, get in the water and then drown. Can't we just do the first part and splash around and have fun? Oh, come on, Fanny, I'm your gal pal. Shopping? Right? No! Out! Kids, grab onto me. Use me to float. Fanny, don't do this. Shut up, Felix! Just sit there and inherit his money. Okay, everyone start drowning now! Glug, glug! Ach! You guys are so bad at drowning. I guess I'm gonna have to shoot you! Oh, God. I'm sorry I got us into this. Kids, I love you. And, Linda, I love you, too. Almost as much as the kids, but not Oh, Bobby I love you, too. I'm sorry I was mad at you about the stupid condos. I love you, Mom! And you, Dad! I love you all. But that's just between us. I love everyone! I love you, Mom. Oh, I love you too, honey. What-what are they all doing? I have no idea. - I love you guys! - I love you, Dad! - Oh, God, they're starting again. - I love you, Mom. Okay, listen up! I'm gonna shoot you first. One Bobby, no! two Fanny, wait! What?! Uh, uh, before I die, um, could you I would really like to hear one of your songs. Really? Oh, my God. So sweet. Which one? Uh, the one about the dancing? And it's really loud? ""Dancing So Loud""? Yes! Well, that one's not really finished yet. I'll sing ""Mr. Dance Floor."" It's hot. Oh, good, good.  Who's that knocking on my door?   Ooh, it's Mr. Dance Floor  Linda, the piling. What? The piling near Fanny, Lin. Ram that boat shaped like a turtle into it. Oh. Got it. Got it.  Everybody's looking fancy   Things are about to get dancey  Show's over, Fanny! Hmm? Quick! Someone untie us! I'm coming for you, Bobby! I'm not that great at knots, but I'll try. Uh Uh Uh Oh, thank God. Yay, Mom. Hmm? Oh, God, swim away! Swim away! Everyone dive! Dive! Tina! Thank God, you beautiful four-eyed son of a bitch. Mom! There's my girls. Where's Gene? I'm over here. Just doin' my own thing. - I'm fine, I'm fine. - Who cares? Where's my Bobby? Ah! You saved us, Linda. Thank God we live in a time where women can learn to swim. A burial at sea it's what the carousel would've wanted. We talked about it a lot toward the end. My little Fanny-apple! Uh-uh, my hair's wet! Where are they going? They're swim-running away! They're escaping to Mexico! Or whatever's across the water. What's over there? So I guess they'll arrest Felix, too. No. I told them Fanny was responsible for everything. What?! Look at him, Bob. We can't send him to jail. He'd hate it there. He tried to kill us. Not really. We were just, uh, wrestling. Like brothers. Wrestling? Tussling? Bonding. I don't know. Oh, my God. Besides, he came back for us. I told you he'd never go through with it. I'm gonna tell them. Hey, how 'bout $4,000? Would that make you feel better? What?! You can't put a price on my family. Two. One. Blastoff! Guys, will you give me a minute here? Great! We'll just forget the whole thing. I didn't say What a crazy day! God, I had cereal in the morning, and by nighttime I'm getting murdered. Lin, I'm trying to work out some money thing here with Mr. Fischoeder, so Uh-uh. You need a warm shower and a hot meal, mister. Felix, I get one free punch. Come here. You know the rules. Bob, I'm glad we found you. I'm glad, too, Lin. The Belchers are a land family. We should be together in a restaurant, not under some dumb wharf. Let's go home. It's not dumb. That's the wharf we saved; That Dad saved. And look how it thanks us. Well, it sort of saved us. We get it, Dad you love the wharf. I don't even want to look at it. Ooh, I'm gonna have a bottle of wine and eat some croutons in bed. Yay, crouton party in Mom and Dad's bed. - No. - Yes! Oh, my God."
"(indistinct arguing) - DOUG: Your son ruined everything! - LINDA: My son is a star! (talking over each other) Calm down, Linda, calm down. He's the future Neil Patrick Harris! What? Neil Patrick Harris is way more talented than Gene. FROND: Quiet down, everyone! Thank you. Now, there's a lot of parents and children waiting out there that came to see the fall musical, but it seems that we have some conflict going on here. Luckily, conflict has one enemy: Me. So I'm going to get out my peace pad and we are going to process this mess and put it to rest. Now, who wants to tell me what happened? I'll tell it! Well, hey, why does he get to tell it? Because he's my beautiful boy, that's why. Yeah, and you're just someone's dad. Yeah, my dad. People, please! Gene It started with the school announcements MS. LABONZ (over P.A.): Attention Wagstaff student body. The fall musical is coming up, and we're not doing Grease again. I can't! I'm not doing it! For this year, we will be accepting student submissions for an original production. (gasps) So, if there's anyone out there - who's creative - Me. - Talented - Me! And musically brilliant Me! this is your big chance. Also, today's lunch is tacos. Tacos?! This is the best day of my life! Shirt rip! (grunting) - You guys! - This is it! I can finally unleash my passion project on the world! Are you talking about Die Hard, the Musical! You've been working on that one for a while. Yeah, ever since I saw Die Hard and said, why is no one singing? Why is no one dancing? What's wrong with Hollywood? Uh-oh. Who's got a necklace in her mouth, is smothering, and like-likes you? - Mom? - LOUISE: No, Courtney. Oh, no. Hey, Gene. Ooh Okay, she wants you back. I'll handle this. Look, Courtney, I know you want to get with this. Okay? But honey It's a mess. I mean, what are we even looking at here? Uh, no, I don't want to get back together. This is about the musical. I bet you're doing the Die Hard One, right? He let me read it when we were dating. That's it, Courtney. Just remember the good times. Anyway, I'd love to be in it. And I've been taking a hip-hop dance class (muttering): I my am Courtney I am I like to give and I go to the I ho ho, and this the ho ho, and now I'm done. (breathing hard): So, yeah. First of all, I love it. Second of all, no. Only because I want my play to be good. I totally get it. That dance was horrible, and I'm really annoying. Anyway, bye! - What? - I didn't say that. But I think I captured the spirit of your words. I am not annoying. Well Yeah, you are. Yeah, it's bad. Well, I remember it this way. May I be in your Die Hard musical, please? No! I like tacos! (farts) Yeah, that sounds like Gene. Yep. Anyway, along came the day we were all supposed to submit our plays So what's your fall musical about? Leaves. (blows note)  Red, yellow, orange and brown   They're on the tree then they fall down.  Good (piano playing) Wait, who's in there now?  I've got the passion of a woman   Looking for her start  And the only thing bigger than my hair  (off-key):  Is my heart! And that's just one of the amazing songs from Working Girl, the Musical! Courtney! You stole my thunder! No, I didn't. So it's just a coincidence you took a beloved movie from the 1980s some say the sassy sister film to Die Hard and set it to music and lyrics? Thunder thief! I'm sorry, but that keyboard is adorable. Did you rescue it from a shelter? Nice one, Daddy. Well, where'd you get your keyboard, Doug, the Too-Big Keyboard Store? Enough keyboard insults. Gene, it'll be your turn in a minute and we can hear what you've got. You'll hear what I've got, all right. Because it is very audible! (chanting): Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi Okay, I'm gonna stop you there. But I haven't even It's fine, don't worry. Thank you. Peter, you can come in now. Ready to catch my fall musical? It's fall, y'all! Ms. LaBonz, did I mention that I know Carly Simon, the artist behind the Working Girl and ""Let the River Run,"" and if we do our play, she'll come to the show? We're doing Working Girl! - Yeah! - All right! - Aah! - Oh. Oh, my poor baby! - My baby. - Lin, not so hard. Can we please stay focused here? We absolutely can, Mr. Frond. Let me take over. You see, being the generous soul that I am, I had to step in and help a brother out. Louise, why are we in the boiler room? I want to just go home and crawl into bed and have a good, long dutch oven cry. Buck up, Gene. It's like I scream into my pillow every time I don't get a horse on my birthday: There's always next year! Guys! There's a secret boiler room in the back of the boiler room that no one knows about. I think, in the olden days, they used it as the faculty opium den. Great. So why are we here? We're here because this room happens to be under the very auditorium where Working Girl, the Musical is gonna be performed. Then this is where I want to die! No, listen! You're gonna put on the guerilla-slash-protest production of Die Hard, the Musical on the same night, in here! It's the perfect way to stick it to Courtney, right in her thunder-stealing face! (gasps) It's brilliant! The symbolism! We'll be up-staging her from down-stairs-stage! No, what's brilliant is we're going to charge five bucks a head. Wow! What a considerate - and lucrative solution to Gene's problem. - I know! You're the smartest person in the whole world! I know! (chanting): Louise is the best! Louise is the best! Louise is the best! Louise is the best! What? What's taking so long? Waiting is gross. Yeah, the show must go on! That's a thing, right? Well, Gene, you violated school rules by entering the prohibited secret boiler room Yup. You decided to put on a guerilla-slash-protest play - the same night as the fall musical - Amazing. Things are not stacking up in your favor here. Do you want the whole story or not, Mr. Frond? Oh, my God, every word. I could do this all night. So things were really coming together Okay, we got the musical, we got the venue. Now all we need is the actors. Right. Do you know Sir Ian McKellen? No. - Crap. Hello, Courtney. Cool piece of paper. Gene, if you're here to try out for Working Girl, the Musical, you're too late. I'm posting the cast list right now. But I suppose I could work you in, as like a really stupid stapler or a desk or something. I'd be an incredible stapler! But don't even worry about it, - 'cause I'm putting on a pl - Weight! He's putting on a lot of weight, not being in any plays or talking about other plays that could get him in trouble. Oh, right Oh, well, good luck with your weight gain. Looks like you're almost there, bye! Thank you. You guys, I'm secretary number one! Eat it, two and three! Yay! - Aw, man. - Come on! Well, Mom, I guess I don't have the dashing good looks and charm of a medium-young Harrison Ford. I think I've found our cast. LOUISE: May I present the People that Didn't Get Cast in Courtney's Play But Still Want to Be in a Play Players. Yep, did not make the cut. I guess I'll have to win an Oscar for wrestling. Is it because I can't not sing like Mariah Carey?  I can't help it. - We stepped on each other's lines. - We stepped on each other's lines. Miss Merkin, what are you doing here? I've played piano for the Wagstaff Musical for 24 years. Then Doug comes in and pushes me out! Well, how are you with a Casio? (plays beautiful riff, adds dog bark) I think I can manage. Oh, wait. We still need a girl to play Holly Gennaro McClane. - So I guess that's you? - Oh, no way. I'm that blond bad-ass guy or nothing. Fine, then it's Tina. Where is Tina? TINA:  I'm Katherine Parker  And I'm super rich  And soon you will find that I'm quite a bleep.  Okay, so I betrayed Gene by being in Courtney's play, but I have a perfectly good explanation.  I'm a business man with a business plan   I need a business woman with some business hands  So, yeah. Oh, God. But your characters don't even end up together! We're all allowed to interpret the movie differently. No, they definitely don't end up together. Eh, to each his own. No, they really don't. Well, comme ci comme ÃÂ§a. All right, well, now you're just saying words. C'est la vie. Anyway, it was the day before the big show. Some of you might call it yesterday See you at my play tomorrow night. I wrote a play, we're doing it tomorrow, see you there. Where? Wait You hear that? It's the sound of me having a play and you not having one! It sounds like,  Yeah, I have a play and you don't have a play   I have a play, you don't have a play  Aah! I'll show you, Courtney Wheeler! In a way that I can't tell you about right now! So never mind! Bye!  Why did you throw that corpse on my car?   'Cause I'm inviting you to the party, pal   Think we're gonna be great pals   Al and John, John and Al  Now come here. I'm gonna wrestle ya. Get over here! Ow! Okay - Come on! - GENE: No, no, no, no! John McClane is in a tower. Sergeant Al Powell is on the ground! You can't wrestle! - I made a creative choice. - Very bold. And Rudy, you're moving your hands too much. And quit wheezing! (wheezing): I'm sorry, the asbestos might be affecting my lungs a little, but I'll work on it. Um, can we turn down the heat? Yeah, it's boiling up in here! It's the boiler room, Zeke! It's what it does! It's like you guys don't even care about this guerilla-slash-protest musical designed to take down Courtney and send us to Broadway! Uh, Gene. - (clears throat) A a word? - Mm-hmm. The play is tomorrow night. We gotta get it together. Give 'em a pep talk, you know? Put some fire in their butts! Is the putting a fire in the butt part of the inspiration, or is that a separate suggestion? - Ugh, damn it. - Fine. Listen up: I wrote an incredible musical. And I thought together we'd create the kind of theater that would make the gods cry. But now I'm like, ""What am I, nuts?"" You're all blowing it! Zeke with your wrestling, Darryl and your extra-note singing, Crazy Arm Rudy over here! Andy and Ollie, FBI agents don't hold hands! These ones do. Yeah, and they sleep in the same bed. And now I'm realizing that the only way to make this production shine is if I fire all of you and play all the roles myself! Uh (chuckling) Say what? Except for Miss Merkin. You're my rock, girl. Thank you. And I've been thinking about getting you drums and maybe a cute top. You cool with that? You know it. So congratulations, the rest of you have been demoted to stagehands on Die Hard, the Musical, a one-Gene show! Hurray. It's gonna kick ass. MR. FROND: So you fired the casting, and made Die Hard, the Musical a one-man show? Yes, starring me. Gene. Yeah. Okay, well, I've come to the part where I blame the parents. Bob, Linda - Hi. - Uh-huh? - I'm blaming you. - Yeah. Oh. Why didn't you step in and do something here? Hey, we don't know all the crazy crap our kids are doing. We don't want to know. But I did start to get suspicious when we were walking into the fall musical and I found this weird thing in my pocket.  Musical! Musical!  Time to watch your sister in a musical!  Wait, what's this weird thing in my pocket? LOUISE: See you in there! ""You are invited to attend the performance ""of Die Hard, the Musical, ""a one-Gene show, in the secret boiler room at school tonight."" Gene's in a musical at school, too? Tonight? Oh, my God, our kids are in competing musicals! I always dreamed this night would happen. - Aw - That's your dream? Yeah, Tina's the president and this. Well, I guess one of us should go to Gene's play. I call Working Girl! Ugh, fine, I'll go backstage to wish Tina good luck. Hey, my little Sigourney Weaver-achiever. How's your stage fright, honey? It just so happens I found the only cure. (whispering): It's his butt. Dad, Jocelyn's shoulder pads are too big! She's stuck in the doorway! (grunts) Just kick her from behind! Sheesh! Theater people! So dramatic. God, I love it. (laughs)  I want to sing, I want to dance   I want to act, I want to play!  Um, Mom?  Yeah Oh, sorry. No! This is Carly Simon's seat. Are you Carly Simon? Uh, no. I know you're not! Wow. Carly Simon's gonna be here?! Psst, Dad! What? Come with me. Oh, um, I think your mom was gonna go to Gene's weird play, and I was gonna stay here and watch Tina. Uh, I don't think so. We need your giant body to make the audience look fuller! But Working Girl's the film that inspired me to be anything I wanted to be! And so you're this? Come on, Dad! (sighs) Fine. Hey, if you want to see some real, gritty theater, we got Die Hard, the Musical down in the basement. Only five bucks! Louise, don't bother these people. Plus, that's not gonna work. Oh. I'm a Die Hard freak. Check it out. Bonnie Bedelia. Also, I'm just an uncle, so no biggie. (chuckles) LOUISE: Here ya go, champ. Geez, it's hot in here. - Whoa, is that a rat? - Yes, it is. Huh. I guess Bob went to Gene's play. My son's doing Die Hard, the Musical, in the basement. It's a competing musical. It's competing with this one right now. Shh! - Aah, you're jealous. - Shh.  This is a boat  A boat that is a ferry  Ferry on the water  Staten Island Ferry  I'm a working girl  A workin' working girl  I'm a girl who's working   I work  In New York Ci ty GENE: All aboard the plane from New York to Los Angeles! (imitating airplane engines) Thanks, Argyle. Boy, that guy on the airplane was right about taking my shoes off.  I'm a barefoot cop oh!  Coffee, coffee  Coffee, coffee   Coffee's all I get  Coffee, coffee   How'm I gonna get ahead  Coffee, coffee  GENE:  I'm Grubin'  I'm Hans Gruber and I'm Grubin'   And sometimes that can mean shootin'   Mr. Takagi in the head  Hey, this is Katherine, you work for me   I've broken my leg while trying to ski   Do me a favor and fill in for me   Even though I stole your radio deal idea   For Trask Industries  You did what?! That's my daughter! - Shh! - Jealous. This is everything that's wrong with Broadway today. Die Hard, one-man-show, in the basement. Blow your mind! Okay. Aw, I'm missing it! Maybe I can pop down for a bit. There I go.  Fight scene, fight scene  We're gonna have a fight scene  (grunting) Oh, my God. Eh, 'scuse me, eh, 'scuse me. I know, right? He's magnificent! Ooh, it's warm in here. Hey, did Louise charge you five bucks? - Yes. - Ooh, rat!  I have a head for business  And a bod for sin  Well I want both, so count me in!  Smile. Smile! What the hell? Where is everybody?! Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going? Uh nowhere. And, uh, not to the Die Hard musical in the basement. Great job, Jimmy Jr.! (whoops) Thanks, Dad. Where the hell is Carly Simon?! She, uh, left a message! She's getting drive through for everyone.  Oh, the life of the wife of a cop   Makes my head spin around like a top  Hey, hey! Five bucks! What's going on?! You're doing your Die Hard musical?! Oh, I love the Holly Gennaro McClane number. Oh, my God! He's musical battling us. I've seen it a million times! Stop it! Stop that singing right now! Nobody tells my son to stop singing! Well, actually, I've probably seen enough. Keep going, baby!  That Johnny McClane's  Driving this gal insane I'll make him stop. (slow-motion): Daddy, no! (grunting in slow motion) (audience gasping) (slow-motion): Huh? - (gasping) Ugh! - Wow. Yes! That man hit my son with a shoulder pad. Hold on! I accidentally grabbed a shoulder pad, maybe it went flying, maybe not. And then she came after me! And Bob pushed me! Hey, I was just pushing you away from Linda. She's crazy. That's right, honey! Oh, my God. I'm rich. - What? - Nothing. Well, I think I've heard everything. Great, let's all go watch the end of my play. I hear the finale is amazing. No, no, my play! Nobody wants to watch you running around changing wigs! Tell that to British Parliament! I-I have to admit, watching one person do Die Hard is a little bad. (gasps) Father! Hey, at least Gene's was raw! From the gut. Courtney's was all slick like a kid didn't even do it. That's because a kid could never do it. Never! Oh, yeah? My son's not the one who promised Carly Simon, and then left everyone hanging! She just texted me that she was car-jacked, but she's still going to try to make it! So we should finish our play, Mr. Frond. Yeah! (stammers) No, no, no, no, no. My mother was right. This musical theater stuff is just too dangerous. So for the safety of everyone, there will be no more musicals tonight. And maybe ever! LOUISE: What? LINDA and TINA: No! I don't know if I have that authority, but at least for tonight, it's finished. - Oh, come on! - No! Tina, what happened? Are we gonna finish the play? No, come here. Shh-shh-shh. Come here, come here. We'll get through this. I-I-I don't want No. No, thanks. Okay, time to go home, everyone. Show's over. (all groaning) Yeah, the whole night was a bust. Come on, Gene. Let's go home. Wait! Mr. Frond! What? I guess one boy, no matter how talented and charismatic and likable doesn't have the right to ruin musicals for everyone. So, Courtney, you finish your play. Aw, Gene. So noble! No, Gene. You were right. I did steal your thunder. Working Girl is the sassy sister film to Die Hard. Everybody knows that. I was just so mad you wouldn't let me be in your play. Well, maybe we can be in each other's plays. I What?! We just need three and a half hours to prepare. Gene, it's 9:30, and I have a lot of sweat in my underwear. Fine, fine. (stammers) No way, Gene. This is done. Aw, too bad. Seems like that conflict resolution could've been epic. Maybe award winning. Oh, my God. You think I could win a Conflicty for this?! Yeah, you could win a Conflicty! Let's do it! (all cheering) All right, come on, everybody! Take my hands. No, wait, wait. Whoa. We got to do this ourselves. It's what Tess McGill would've wanted. But Courtney, honey (muffled mumbling) Sometimes Shh! Sometimes to break through the glass ceiling, you got to break some hearts. And glass. You probably think this slap is about you. Ow! So I don't know if we can pull this off, I mean, we wrote and rehearsed it in under 20 minutes, but if we do, it's because we did it together. All of us. That's exactly what people say before they make a baby, I think. Okay, well, without any further ado, we present to you the musical rom-com-slash-action-thriller, Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl. Oh, no! We're a bunch of secretaries from New York held hostage in Nakatomi Towers! Shush! I'm Karl, the one with beautiful hair! I'm Hans Gruber. Consider yourself Grubed! Tess McGill can't let a bunch of terrorists ruin her dream. I hope the police come soon. Ow! Glass! Hurtin' John McClane's feet!  I'm Agent Johnson  And I'm Agent Johnson  And we're from the FBI  I'm Johnson He's Johnson! -  He's Johnson - I'm Johnson! BOTH:  Two fancy-footed federal guys   I might just be a local cop   But will you guys back off me?   Things are getting pretty tense   Does anybody want coffee?  You know we're not so different, you and I.  We're both ambitious, Hans  Tess McGill, you've stolen this Gruber's heart.  Like I'm stealing  Like you're stealing  These bearer bonds  I cracked the co de So here's the bearer bonds. Which is the same as money, I guess. Hey, let's make that radio deal. Hip hop? Hip hop.  Mwah! That's not in the script. Just go with it they love it! Is that two rows of teeth I'm feeling? My baby teeth never fell out. And Jack Trainer and I are a couple now as well, so that's good. Hip hop. Hip hop.  Hans, you're feeling love's great power   But now I got to push you off the tower!  Now come here. I'm gonna get ya. Come on. (screams) I'm so mad about my brother so I kill you about it! No! (screams) Thanks, Al! If only there was a place where we could all be happy and not get killed! ALL:  Maybe there's a tower  Somewhere up above  Filled with bearer bonds and love   Where dreams don't die hard  Maybe there's a tower  Somewhere up above  Filled with shoulder pads and love   Where dreams can fly hard  But until we can live in that imaginary world   We'll work hard or die trying, girl.  Yes! Yes! (whoops) Oh, my God! Carly Simon? Who? Oh, sorry. Y-You you look like Carly Simon. You look like Carly Simon. It's a compliment. Back off. Sorry. Geez. I smell a Tony! Which is also what happens to be what I call my farts.  Work hard   Or die trying,  WOMAN:  Ooh, you work hard, you die hard   Work hard  GENE: You work hard! ZEKE: Come on, come on! WOMAN:  Oh!  Or die trying, girl   You work hard, you try hard  Ooh  Work hard   Ooh-ooh-ooh  Or die trying, girl  GENE: Yeah!  You work hard, you die hard  Work hard   No, no, no, no, no  Work hard  Or die trying, girl  GENE:  Ooh, yeah!"
"Two days until trick-or-treating? What am I supposed to eat until then? Other food? I know. Like what? Like, bread? I don't know if I'm gonna go trick-or- treating this year, guys. All the bigger kids are hanging out at the old cemetery. Hi, Jimmy Jr. Are you going to the cemetery on Halloween? what time were you planning on going? 'Cause I'm planning on going at that time, too. I'm going when all the other kids are going. Oh, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. But why does everybody want to go to a stupid cemetery on a day when you can knock on people's doors and they literally hand you free candy? And then you kiss them on both cheeks! So, just to nail this thing down, we're going to the cemetery together? Geez, Tina. Everybody's going at the same time. We're not going together. It's a group activity. Kids go and break into the mausoleum. It's a rite of passage! Mm-hmm. So you think that's, like, 8:30? Maybe touch base around 8:15? I'll just see you there if I see you. God, he was all over you.  Ghosts and goblins, goblins and ghosts, yeah.  This year I got the bats that are smiling. It's more realistic. Why is it more realistic? 'Cause they're happy. It's their favorite holiday. They love it. Hi, I'm the exterminator. Oh, hi. From Hugs Not Bugs, the sensitive bug killers. Well, the name is misleading. We actually use a highly toxic chemical. It hugs them to death, really slowly. They suffer. I'm Marcus. Uh, they showed up the other day. I-I don't know what they are. They're weird. Uh, everything okay? This isn't good. What-what isn't good? This is very bad. What is very bad? This is really creeping me out. You're creeping me out. What-What's going on here? Bobby! Is he squirting poison? The kids just got home and they want to watch. There is definitely an otherworldly presence in this basement. A what? A presence. Wait, are you saying ""presence""? A presence? Presents? I always thought there should be Halloween presents! No, not presents. A presence. A ghost. There's a ghost in this basement. Yes! What? A ghost? Who said ""ghost""?! We have a ghost? Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. You need to catch it and get rid of it. Like salmon. Whoa, whoa Marcus. Hi. Hello. Uh, question. Did you say we have to catch the presence? Yes. How does one do that? First, you got to make contact with the ghost. Then you got to try to get it into a vessel. A vessel? Yeah, like a bottle. Or a box. Oh, a vessel. Cool. Can you please get rid of the bugs first? Dad! So we get it into the box. And then what? Throw away the box in the trash. Great. Now on to the bugs. Can you just squirt them with your thing now? No way. Those are probably phantasmal bugs attracted to the spirit world. Sure, sure. Phantasmal bugs. I'm not going down there. I got to go. You cannot be a real exterminator. I'm licensed and I'm running away. Bye, Marcus! Bye. Uh, I'm not paying you for this! I'll get the Ouija board! And a box! And candles! And some smooth jazz. Well, the restaurant is closed. Thank you so much for not helping out at all tonight. You're welcome. I called another exterminator, not that you care. So, yeah, just go ahead, do your capture-the-ghost sÃ©ance. Mm-hmm. - All right, so here's our vessel. I brought my Easy Breezy shoe box. It used to hold the world's most comfortable heels. Now it's gonna hold a ghost. What a life this box has had. Okay. Here we go. We're gonna make contact with the other side. I just need one more sip of my sÃ©ance wine. Yep. If you make contact, can you ask the ghost if it's any good with a mop? Ha-ha. Very funny. Open the door. Attention, ghost. We are gathered here today to help you cross over into this box. Kids, put your hands on the thingy. is there a spirit here in this basement? It's moving! Great. They're in here, too. Hey, guess what. You're not phantasmal. You're phan-dumb. Oh, my God! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Ooh What is your name? - What's your name, baby? - Stop moving it, Louise. I know it's you. I'm not moving it. It's Gene. It's not me. Ooh! Look, it's spelling something out. J E F F. Jeff. I just got chills. How old are you, Jeff? One. Three. So the ghost is a That's interesting. To all of us. Jeff, do you, uh, want to check out the inside of this totally normal shoe box? I think he's in the box! Put the lid on it! Got it.  Hello? Did anybody hear me screaming? There was a crazy amount of bugs flying at my face. Bobby, calm down. We caught the ghost. His name is Jeff. Everything is fine. Everything is not fine, Lin. We have a horrible bug problem in there, and I'm sick of all this ghost stuff. Ghost stuff is over. Now we do the ceremonial throwing it away in the trash. No, wait! Don't! You can't just throw Jeff out. Ghosts were people, too. What if it's Jeff Bridges? Imagine the money. Tina, what are you doing? We're keeping Jeff. You can keep him, Tina, but you have to empty his box every night! So, Jeff, how's your first day at school going? purgatory or the smell in Tina's locker? It doesn't smell anymore, Louise; I got rid of the yogurt. Why do you guys have an Easy Breezy's shoe box? I didn't know it was Take Your Mom's Shoes to School Day. There aren't shoes in this box. It's a ghost. Mm. You're totally lying. And lying is bad for your skin, thank you. Why is everyone looking at a box? What am I missing? I'm bored. Somebody explain it to me quick! It's a ghost. His name is Jeff. It's a strong Christian name. You have a ghost, Tina? Oh. Hi, Jimmy Jr. This is Jeff. He's a ghost, he's a boy, and we've been spending a lot of time together. Ghosts aren't real. Yeah. Death is the end. It's final! That's right, Zeke. Yeah, nothing more! High five! Really? Well, maybe Jeff will have something to say about that. Anyone want to talk to him? I do. Okay. All right. Hands on the Ouija board, everybody. You can ask him anything you want about the afterlife. All right. If you're real, what do ghosts eat? It's moving. S O U P. Soup! He's right! Must be real. Whoa. This changes a lot for me. A lot. Are you okay, Zeke? No, this is weird. Well, Zeke's changed. Who's next? I have a question. Were you cool when you were alive? V E R Y. Very! Jeff is cool! I-I don't think Jeff is real. Something smells fishy. Oh, man. He got you! Ghost burn. That's not funny. Jeff's funny. Uh-oh. Time's up everyone. Wait, wait. One more question. Hey, Jeff, do you want to walk me to class? You go, girl. He has a creepy crush on you. Weird. We have to call another exterminator. Let's go with ""Beetle Kanevil""? What is wrong with the exterminators in our town? Why don't you ask him? Marcus! I just wanted to show this place to some of my friends. This is Phil and Don. Hi. Wait, what? They're gonna check it out. I'm gonna run away. Bye, Marcus! Good luck! I hope you don't die! He always says that. What are you doing? What's all this? Mm. I'm definitely recording some EMF traces in here. We just might have something substantial on our hands. Are you paranormal investigators? Guilty. I'm Don, vice president of our local chapter. This is Phil. He's president. Mm-hmm. Voted in by a landslide. One vote. It was me. Uh, you can't do that stuff in here. This is a business. So, Marcus told you about our ghost. His name is Jeff. Uh, he's doing great. I mean, he's adjusting well. I Bob, do you think he's comfortable? Lin, stop. There is no ghost. Oh, boy. Don, you're gonna want to take a look at this. Okay. This booth is covered in some serious spectral traces. My meter's going crazy. Mine, too. Of course, it could be cell phone interference. Mm-hmm. Or an AM radio. Or a microwave. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I bet it's a ghost. Mm-hmm. Oh! You hear that, Bob? A ghost. Uh-huh. Looks like we got our work cut out for us. Phil, you think we should order some lunch? Burger. Medium well. Man knows what he wants. That's why he's president. Ow. What's going on here? Um, nothing. Don't mind them. Can I help you? They have a ghost. We're here to investigate. No, there's no ghost. Don't listen to him. He's Honey, they have a ghost. Let's eat here. I mean, yeah, we have a ghost. Uh, come on in. Sit down. We have at least one in every booth. Jeff, people are loving you! Tina's hanging out with the most popular box in the school. I don't even care that he's popular. To me, he's just Jeff. Bye. Wait, wait, where are you going? Oh, I was thinking of showing Jeff the butterflies at the science center. You guys don't want to come along, do you? Probably not. Great. Bye. Jeff, you have my sister home by 11:00! Wait, make that 9:00, Jeff and I are gonna watch Kitchen Nightmares. That's gonna be our thing! The butterflies are beautiful this time of year. The rest of the time, they're caterpillars. Are we holding hands? I can't really tell. Jeff, you'd tell me if you were just a box, right? You're just a box, aren't you? I'm on a date with a box. Oh, my God. Whoa. I'm getting butterfly kisses from a butterfly. Is it you, Jeff? Is this a sign? - Oh, boy. You really are real. - What are you doing? No, no, no. No eating the butterflies! What is in the box? Um Jeff. Who's Jeff? Oh, wow. Um you're kind putting us on the spot here. Is he a friend? Is he more than a friend? We're just enjoying it right now without labels. Oh. I thought it was food or drink. Enjoy your visit. Lin, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad a crazy exterminator told us we had a ghost. Big day. People like your burgers more when there's a dead person in the restaurant. Okay, people. We're gonna listen for subsonic metaphysical phenomena now. We need everybody to be very quiet in here. Except for ghosts. You guys talk it up. Hi, everyone! Oh! Ah! Oh, my. Oh. Damn it. We have an announcement. We're officially dating. Ooh! Ghost boyfriend! You'll have to get some clanking chains for prom. Aw. Wait. Is there a ghost in that vessel? Did you just say you two were dating? Dad, you're not gonna like every guy she brings home. Mm, I'm getting some heavy activity. Of course you are. It's Jeff. He's like that. Congratulations, Bob. He seems great. Yep. Every father's dream. Aw. There he is! Coolest guy in school. What's up, Jeff? Oh, hi, everyone. Uh, me and my boyfriend Jeff were just looking to have a little lunch. Oh, my God, did you just say ""boyfriend""? Did I? Oh, yeah, I did. Hmm. You guys are so cute together! You're the new ""it"" couple! Whoa, people, give them some space here. No photos! Well, Jeff and I are gonna get in line. God, just leave him here for a second. You're smothering him, Tina. Let him breathe. He's already in a box. Yeah, let him hang out with us. This ghoul needs some guy time. Come on, Jeff! I'm gonna get ya! Get over here, all right! Oh. Uh, okay. We'll do our own thing for a bit and then meet up later. See you in a few, Jeff. I'm gonna get you! Get over here. Miss you already. Get your ass up here! Come on. Careful. I'm back, Jeff. Hope you like hot dogs Where did Jeff go? Tammy got some mustard on Jeff's box, so she went to wash it off. You guys, get in here! I went into the stall to go number one, because I never go number two at school, or at all, because that's gross, and Jocelyn clogged the toilet that one time. I'm sorry, Jocelyn. But look what I found when I came out! Huh? ""Tina and I are taking a break. ""Tammy, you are hot. Be my GF."" Wait. What? Jeff asked me out! And of course I said ""no"" 'cause that's not fair to Tina. Just kidding! I said yes! Oh, yay! Oh, my God, you guys are the coolest couple in school! You deserve it. I guess now I have a hottie without a body. Come on, Jeff. Nobody's saying it, but Jeff is a scoundrel! He's buried, not married! I can't believe Jeff dumped me for Tammy. Since when can Jeff write on mirrors? I'm pretty sure that's his handwriting. It's girly, but it's just 'cause he's sensitive. The girl's bathroom is nice! Each stall has a tiny metal mailbox. I'm glad I was carrying around that postcard for Ken. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through the rest of the day. Come on, Tina, get off the floor. What's the big deal? He's not even hot for a box. That's not what I care about. I care about what's inside. Also, we don't know if that's water or urine you're lying in. I think it's just water. Yeah, water. No, pee. Tina, they're gonna do an ultrasound on your box. The box didn't quite make it home with us today. Kids, there's a lot of people who are very focused on the box. Where's the box? Did he switch vessels? No, he didn't switch vessels. He switched girlfriends! To an annoying girl named Tammy! Ugh! I hate his stupid ghost face! He dumped you?! I'm gonna kill him. Again. Oh, I knew this would happen. Sort of. Spirit appears to be a bit of a player. Tina's gonna be okay. I made her a PB and J. She said she didn't want it, so I ate it. She was still sad, so I made her another PB and J. She didn't want that one either, so I ate it. Anyway, Tina wants to be alone for a little while, and we're out of peanut butter. Guys, I hate to break your hearts, too, but Jeff isn't real. What are you talking about? I was controlling the Ouija Board. I was messing with you guys. Yeah. I thought that was pretty obvious. I named him Jeff. It's the stupidest name for a ghost I could think of. Of course. Oh, yeah. I know Jeff's not real. It was Louise. Sure. Wait, so let me get this straight. His name's not Jeff, but he's real. No, Gene, there is no Jeff! I just thought it would be funny. I didn't think Tina would fall in love with him. And I definitely didn't think Tammy was gonna pull the same crap as me but better with that mirror thing. And now I'm gonna go tell Tina and say I'm sorry, and we're all gonna laugh about this someday, right, guys? I don't think that's such a good idea. Lin, why is that not such a good idea? 'Cause Tina's already feeling heartbroken right now. If we tell her the truth, she's gonna feel heartbroken and dumb. She got catfished by a box! So I'm not telling Tina? You'll see. You'll all go trick-or-treating tomorrow. She'll be fine. She'll be back to her normal, teeny Tina. She just needs nougat. Happy Halloween! I'm a witch! Costume fashion show! Get out here, kids! Here comes Gene! Turner and Hooch. Half dog, half Hanks, all cop! More like Turner and Cute. Come here, you! Oh, here comes Louise. Shiny scorpion person. Wow! I'm Ryan Gosling from the major motion picture trailer Drive. So violent, but so well-reviewed. And here she is, last but not least, Tina! Dressed as a pretty glasses girl. Wait. You didn't change at all. I'm not gonna go trick-or-treating, guys. What? No. You should go! Eat your candy. You need it. Yeah, no, I'm just gonna hang out here for a while. And later, I might stop by the cemetery. If I don't show my face now, I'll never be able to do it. What? Why would you go there? Tammy's gonna be there. And a certain cardboard box. Ruff! You guys go ahead without me. I'll be fine. I'll just watch other people have fun on Halloween. That kid's having fun. Glad Tina's okay. Time to go trick-or-treating! Are you kidding me? Tina is not okay. Look at her. I know what we have to do now. Tammy's going down, and she's going down with a strong dose of her own medicine. Which I invented! Love it. One suggestion. Can we go trick-or-treating for a couple of hours, and then see how we feel? No, Gene! Can we just stop for ramen? Ha, all right! We're the older kids now! Hanging out in the cemetery! Man, in a few years, we'll be parents! And I have a serious boyfriend. So, uh, I guess we're supposed to break into that creepy mausoleum, huh? It's a rite of passage. Hey, we got a ghost with us. We're good, right? Jeff, you know the doorman? Oh. Hey, guys. Oh. Um, you two have, like, zero out of ten permission to be here. You're too young. Yeah, little fetuses. Hooch, heel! Where's Tina? Crying into her butt? No. My butt is dry and strong. Ew. Ruff! Good boy. Hey, Louise. Tina, I'm glad you're here. You're gonna want to see this. I thought you guys were gonna go trick-or-treating. And I thought you guys were gonna actually go into the mausoleum. We're going! We're just we're just getting our legs ready. Look, here they go! We're about to march right in! Tammy? Tammy? What? What? It's so awkward that Jeff's ex is here. It's like so You could cut the tension with a knife. No, like, whatever. I'm so confident, because Jeff is, like, so over her. Come on, legs. Good, great, come on. Keep going! You can shake, but you can't quit on me! I can't see anything! Whoa. Someone just knocked Jeff out of my hands! You guys don't even care! I would care, but I'm too scared! Zeke, light the rite of passage candle. Here you go! I took it from my Dad's Jacuzzi tub. Here's your boyfriend, Tammy. I found him on the ground. You should really be more careful. Great. Now he's got ground on him. Sorry the candle smells like lavender. Kind of changes the vibe a little bit. Yeah. I'm feeling really relaxed all of a sudden. The door slammed shut! Well, somebody open it! It's locked! I can't open it! No! Oh, no. Tina, try it again! I can't budge it. It just won't open. Louise, how'd you do that? I didn't. That wasn't part of my plan. Well, then what was your plan? I put some bugs from the basement in Tammy's box. That's it? Gene, you were there. You helped me get the bugs. I know. I just thought there was gonna be more to it. But, yeah, no, it's-it's good. Oh, my God! Guys, look at this! ""You are all condemned to eternal damnation ""in here with me. ""This is Jeff!"" Jeff trapped us! Not cool, Jeff! Not cool. 'Oh, no! Eternal damnation sounds bad and long! It's the worst kind of damnation! If you really aren't doing this, Louise, Hooch is gonna have an accident. I swear it's not me. I knew I shouldn't have taken Tina's spooky seconds! Ugh! Got her. Uh-oh. This might have backfired a little bit. They're on me! They're on me! Listen! Listen to me! I have something to say. We're not trapped in here for eternal damnation. - I wrote that. - What?! Jeff the ghost isn't real. My sister made him up. Dude, what?! Oh, my God. That was me. Uh, hi, everybody. The bugs were also me. Part of me always kind of thought Jeff was fake. But then, last night, when I heard my family talking about how fake he was, I realized that he definitely was fake. Mm. Ah. Also, it's crazy. It's a box. But the things we wanted from Jeff were real. I wanted a boy to pay attention to me and never leave my side. Ah. Oh, man. I wanted to believe that there's more than this life. I wanted to believe so bad. It's okay, Zeke. Oh, God. It just means take advantage of the here and now. Oh, I hear you, man. And I wanted someone to watch Kitchen Nightmares with. And I just liked him 'cause everyone else liked him. I need to start thinking for myself, unless you guys don't think that's cool. Then I won't. And Tammy wanted to steal someone away from me because she's a horrible, jealous girl. She's right! Tammy's a handful! But we don't need Jeff. We can get these things from ourselves. Ah! I don't need a boy to pay attention to me. I'll pay attention to myself. And, Gene, it's okay to watch Kitchen Nightmares alone. And it's okay that I'm jealous and terrible. No, no. Fix yourself! Holy crap! Tina, you're amazing. I can't believe you planned this whole thing. You-you shut the door and pretended it was locked. You came here early and wrote this on the wall. What'd you use, by the way? Hopefully, not paint. It's ketchup. Checks out. Listen, I'm really sorry I made up a ghost that you fell in love with. It's okay. It was good practice for when a real ghost comes along. Well, you made this the best Halloween ever. And there's still time to go trick-or-treating! It's 10:30. It's too late. Ah, damn it, Jimmy Jr.! Why do you always know the time?! I have a watch. Oh. Quick, to the Pacific time zone! It's still Halloween in San Diego! I'll be honest. I miss Jeff. Well, Bob, we have a lot of data to sift through. We got to get back to the lab. Let's, uh, close out your tab here. You guys ate, uh, 11 burgers. All delicious. We were about to settle the bill with you, too, Bob. Let's see. We did a beta wave test, a black light scan and an audio spectral recording. With all these services rendered, looks like it's gonna be a wash. Bye, Bob. Bye, Linda. You can't leave. You have to pay for your food. We can't pay you. Mm. Why? Should we tell him, Phil? Mm-hmm. We've been dead for 12 years. Oh, my God! Bobby, they're ghosts! I knew it. Bye! Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Hold on. Watch out, Bobby! They're gonna walk right through you! Do you take credit cards? Oh, they're not ghosts."
"I hope you didn't need this jar. We're getting into canning. What are you gonna can? Farts. Oh! When you need one, you don't have one. And when you have one, you need more! Wash it when you're done! Wait. If we freeze the fart, it'll last forever! It'll be all that's left of the human race when the aliens show up. Ha-ha, aliens! We farted on you! Hey, let's go down and see if we can make the walk-in cold enough to make fartcicles. Guess who just went to the doctor for his five-year checkup? Kirstie Alley. Me. Longest I've been naked in three years. Well, what'd he say? Doctor stuff. You know, ""Your cholesterol is off the charts."" ""You absolutely must change your eating habits, or you will die."" Anyway, one cheeseburger and fries, please. Maybe you should be a little concerned, right? You eat a burger pretty much every day. That-that can't be good for you. Yeah. Right. Don't you eat your burgers every day? Not every day. Yeah. We order off-menu. It's how we have fun, right? Kill me. Ha-ha, that's nice. Anyway, cheeseburger and fries, please. You sure you want to ignore your doctor, Teddy? I'm not ignoring him. I'm just not listening to him. - Bob's Burgers. - This is Teddy's doctor. Let's take a look at Teddy's heart, shall we? Okay. Whoa. That's strange. Oh, hey hey, that tickles! What are you doing? Whoa. Look at that. Sick! Can I bring that to show-and-tell?! See how disgustingly unhealthy it is? And it gets bigger and bigger with every burger you serve him. Uh Doctor, stop shoving burgers into his heart! Oh, but I'm not, Bob. You are. Mmm! Keep 'em coming, Bob. Oh, God, no! Keep 'em coming No! Keep 'em coming! It's gonna pop! It's gonna blow! I'm sorry, Teddy! What? What happened? What-what happened? I'm killing Teddy. What? You're gonna kill Teddy? All right, car's gassed up. That's good. Guess I could home-school the kids 'cause No, Lin, the burgers are killing him. What? The ones I give him every day. Oh. Gotcha. Good God, Linda. You had all that ready? What? I'm just being supportive. Good night. Lowering the temperature a few degrees really works. I should have worn my higher socks. You guys call them pants. Is it frozen? Sorry, kids, no fartsicles. Just disappoint-sicles. Well, this experiment was a bust. Aah! Stupid patch of ice! Sorry, you're not stupid. You're just slippery. Hold on. This stupid patch of ice might actually be a genius. And tomorrow, the walk-in goes from stinky to rinky. Feels weird cooking a veggie burger. Plus, he's going to know it's not a hamburger. Nah, nah, Teddy'll eat whatever you put in front of him. Remember when he ate that receipt? Well, I hope you're right. This tastes kind of funny. You don't need to look at it. Just eat it. It tastes burger-ish, but not good. Is that what you were going for? It's a Veggie burger. It's a what? A veggie burger?! Listen Agh! Ugh! Why would you do that? Oh! Why? Oh! Teddy Now I can't get the taste out of my mouth. Ugh! Look, I can't in good conscience serve you a burger every day. I don't see you shoving a veggie burger down Mort's throat, and he eats a burger every day. That's not true. I often get the soup. What?! You do? Soup?! Take it easy, Teddy. Wait. Teddy, you eat a burger every day? Of course I do! That's messed-up. You eat a lot of burgers, Mike, the mailman! Yeah, but I walk nine miles a day. Look at my calves. Wait. Don't look at my calves. They're not that impressive. Okay, here's the deal, Teddy. I'll-I'll make you soup or salad, but I don't think I can serve you my burgers anymore. You cutting me off, Bobby? I guess I am. You're cutting me off?! Is this some kind of sick joke?! I think it's for your own good. You stay the hell out of this, Mort! Bob, if you take your burgers from me, I will murder you and your mouthy wife. What? Huh? I'm sorry! I don't know what I'm saying. I'll kill you! Give me a burger! Teddy! Calm down. You calm down! Oh, my God. Whoa. I will replace that. I don't want to be alive. I don't want to be alive! He's handling this well. Mm-hmm. Fire! There's a fire. Fire! No, Lin, it's the alarm clock. What? Snooze it. Oh, you know the buttons don't work. I have to unplug it. Someone unplug the alarm clock! Thank you! Where are you going so early? I told Teddy I'd go jogging with him. He wants to prove to me that he's healthy enough to be un-cut-off from our burgers. Why are you running if you don't want to? Just tell your teacher you have sciatica. I think it's sweet you're helping your best friend. Teddy's not my best friend. Teddy thinks you're best friends. - He does? - Sure. Yup. Wait. Who's your best friend then? Mm probably Walter Russo. Walter Russo?! When was the last time you talked to Walter Russo? I don't know, like, six years ago. Bob, you see Teddy every day. Yeah, but Teddy's not my best friend, Lin. He's my best customer. There's a big difference. And I really value that 30 inches of Formica that's between us. Are you talking about your dingdong, Daddy? Brag. Yeah, well, off to take my best customer jogging so his heart doesn't explode. All right, have fun. Are you all in bed with Mom? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Coming up, coming up. Oh, our little seal platform. What is that? My alarm clock. Got to go. Oh! Uh, we gotta go check on nothing! Oh, yeah, maybe the nothing's ready! Aw. It's perfect. Huh? Look how high my knees are! I'm in great shape. Great enough for one burger? I don't think so, Teddy. Oh. Should we call the cops? Some kind of early morning gang brawl? Wait I-I think they're fake fighting. Excuse me. What-what's going on over there? It's called stuntman boot camp. I'm in the best shape of my life. You're a stuntman? No. I just train like one. You should check it out. Whoa. Grenade! And another grenade! Got to admit, that looks kind of cool. Sort of cool. Well, that guy doesn't look cool. All right, great ""grenadies,"" everybody. Now, don't forget to sign up for the intensive, weekend-long, stuntman boot camp in the woods. Where you might learn how to do this. Go ahead. Now this is actually a ten-story burning building, and I'm on fire. Ow! On fire! Oh, wow. I'm on fire! I'm on fire! So much fire! Falling and rolling like you're on fire burns as many calories as running, people. That is why, pound for pound, stuntmen are the greatest athletes in the world. Up top! Huh. I thought it was golfers. It's not golfers? Holy frozen nips! Look at this place! It's so slippery! Yeah, we like it. It's all right, I guess. So, what do you do down here? Well, we've experimented with lots of stuff. We tried - curling. - We tried lying on the ice. That was refreshing. Some of us didn't like it as much as others, but we respect their opinions. And ice fishing. We did not get a bite. In the end, the most fun thing to do is this! Whoa! So pushing? Ice pushing. It all makes sense! Hi, Andy. Hi, Ollie. Hi, Louise and Gene and Tina's mom! Louise said to say we're meeting in the basement for homework club. Okay. Have fun. Homework club?! Oh, my God, they're doing drugs to each other! Push me till I feel something, Zeke! Well, well, well. Mom! Hey, uh, uh, we were just all getting a-a head of Yeah? A head of lettuce. Mom, you didn't happen to look down, did you? As a matter of fact, I'm looking down right now, Tina. And it's amazing! Oh, God, look at it shimmer! It's frozen water! They call it ""ice,"" and it's gonna change the world! If you're gonna be pushing each other on the ice like this, you need to be wearing Helmets. I know. I've been a broken record about it. No! Costumes! Glitzy ones with sequins! I want to be the bad boy of ice pushing like Elvis Stojko! And I want to be the bad boy of public radio, like Elvis Mitchell! I'll go get the costumes. Ooh, and don't tell your father. We won't if you won't! Got to love that woman. Hey, Lin. Whoa! Where-where where are you going? What?! What? What? Nowhere. What's this stuff? What? What are we doing? We're making burgers? Let's do it. Let's go. What's this? This is to-go? Hey, buddy, catch! I-I got this. Geez, Lin. Here you go. Hey, there, Teddy. One veggie burger, please. I just got to use the restroom real quick. Hmm. You ever see Teddy with a briefcase before? Only in that one play. I forgot about that. Put the coffee down! Coffee is for closers only! Teddy, what are you doing in there? Washing my hands or something. I can hear you chewing. You're chewing a burger. Did you get that guy to buy you a burger?! No, I'm just checking the bathroom to see that it's not leaking. He's eating! Teddy, stop eating. You don't know how hard this is for me. I paid that guy $300 to buy me this burger. Come on, Teddy, you owe it to yourself. No, I don't. Okay. Well, then do it for me. Ah, you're just helping me because you feel guilty. That's not why. Yeah, it is. Admit it, Bobby. No, it's not. Admit it! Teddy, it's because you're my friend. Your best friend! I didn't say Besties. Linda. Really, Bob? We're best friends? I mean  Best friends till the very end!  Lin.  He crashes on your couch when he loses his job   A guy pulls a knife, and you jump in front  What?!  You take the blade right in the gut!  Oh, my God. Ow!  Then he holds your hand till the medic comes  Linda, thank you. You son of a bitch. Get in here, bestie. Oh. Okay. You got it. You got it. Yeah.  You feed him soup when he breaks his jaw   You help him pee when he has that thing   He's your best friend  Ah, hockey. Well, I-I guess it's time to hit the hay, huh? Bup-bup-bup-bup, hold on, hold on. What? What? I got to take this. Hello. Really? We got in? Ha, ha! How about that. Okay, hey, we'll see you in the morning. Tremendous news! Remember how you said that stuntman boot camp was cool? You didn't sign us up for that, did you? Better! I signed us up for the intensive weekend boot camp retreat in the woods! What? You did? Yup, the whole weekend. So I'd watch the restaurant, the walk-in, everything in the walk-in, and you'd be gone? Huh? Ah, nothing. And it's two to a cabin, so you and me will be roomie-caboomies! I don't know, Teddy. That, um, doesn't sound like something I want to do. What?! You've always wanted to do stunts in the woods. Yeah. Get the hell out of here! Yeah, go for it, Dad. Do it! Though you've already pulled off the toughest stunt of all raising three great kids. Yeah. Come on, Bobby. My treat! Okay, I'll go. That's, um Thanks. Aw, it's nothin'. Well, not nothin'. I won't have electricity for three months. But yay!  He crashes on your couch when he loses his job  Okay  He helps you pee when you've got that thing  Okay, that's great.  He hates squirrels 'cause you hate squirrels  Please stop.  He's your best friend   Your best friend  There's gonna be a lot of exercise this weekend. So take it easy, okay? You're not in the best shape, you know. I know, best buddy. Okay. Now I need everybody to breath out stress Mm-hmm. breath in stunts. Stunts. Congratulations, you've now got stunts inside of you. Now we're gonna get cracking and roll down these stairs here. So everybody knows that falling down a flight of stairs is the same as doing 100 sit-ups. Really? We're doing this? You're a mid-level drug dealer in an apartment stairwell. Cameras are rolling. Bang! You've been shot. Uh Action! Action, man! Go! You got to go! Go! This is a go. That's you, Bobby. That was a go. Go, go, go go, go! What? Wait a Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow. Wow! That was terrible! Wait, have you done any of your morning melees in the park? No! Oh! Well, then you could really get hurt. Welcome to the Freezer-Dome! Whoever wins this whole shebang takes this baby home! Ooh. It's beautiful. Aw. You all look so cute. Everyone got their pillows? Yes. Now let's rumble! If your butt touches ice, you're dead. Really? No. No, you're just out, honey. Two kids enter, one kid leaves! Two kids enter, one kid leaves! First up, Rudy versus Louise! Go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why am I going against Rudy? He's a pushover, a cupcake. What? I'm tough. Rudy, I'm in your P.E. class. I was there for the kickball incident. That was humbling. Yeah. Hey, it's called weight class, cool breeze. Deal with it. You can't hang with the big boys, anyway. Oh, I can't hang with the big boys? No, I'm gonna hang with the big boys. You'll see. Look at me. Ding! Oh. All right, take care, buddy. Next! That's Mama's girl! This is sugar glass, everyone. Fights often end with someone flying through a window. It's a staple in action movies. And an amazing cardio workout, which you can incorporate into your daily routine. My grandmother does it. Now, Teddy, you're looking for the guy who kidnapped your daughter. Bob, you're the guy who kidnapped his daughter. Ooh. You are a horrible person. Teddy wants revenge. Go! Wait, why am I the person who's No! Where's my daughter, punk?! Get Teddy, get off. Get off! Today, one of you will advance to the Freezer-Dome championship. The other one will leave in shame. But all the losers get stickers. Stickers of shame! Now fight! Clank-clank! You're going down, Zeke. Good luck with my low center of gravity. I'm practically unpushoverable. We'll see about that. Come on, girl! I told you you're going down. Yeah! I did it! I pushed a girl and not because I like her and didn't know how to show it! Oh. Sorry, sweetie. You got to get off the ice. Go on, get off. Louise versus Gene! Easy win, Gene. I'll be waiting for you in the finals. Well, if he shows up to the finals and looks like me, that's because it's me, Zeke! I'm Mommy to both of you, but let's see who wants Mommy's love more. Ding! I want Mom's love pretty bad, so look out. Oh, yeah? How 'bout a little of this? Well, you're sturdier than I thought. Sturdy and purdy. Hold on, hold on. I got something in my eye. Man, it's really in there. Gene, have a seat. This could take a while. No problem. You fell for it! Aw! She beat you fair and square, unfairly, here in the Freezer-Dome! She advances to the finals tomorrow! I'm coming for you, Zeke! Bring it on! You've got to be kidding me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wake up, stuntboys! I'm sorry that was weird I don't have a bugle. It can't be morning. No, no, no, no, no. Big day today! You're gonna get chased by robots, get set on fire it literally burns the calories right off. Freeze, human. We have apprehended you. Beep beep. All right, time-out, time-out, time-out. What is going on here? Oh, my God. You don't have the mental fortitude of someone that wants to train to not be an actual stuntman. It's like you don't even want to be here. Because I don't! What?! Look, guys, I only came here as a workout buddy for my friend Teddy because I felt guilty. I mean, he's not even my friend. What are your words even meaning? Listen, between you and me, I had to say he was my best friend so he'd get healthy and not eat my burgers all the time. Oh, I sell burgers. So he's really my best customer, 'cause all he does is shove burgers in his mouth. But he's not my best friend. Oh. Oh, my God. Hey, Teddy. Hey. So, uh, you just heard all that. And you're on fire. Those words hurt more than that fire. Yeah, he's gonna be scarred inside and outside. And o We should put Put him out he's scarring. We should put him out. He's starting to scar. Yeah. How could you lie to me like that?! Who says they're someone's best friend when they're not?! I lied because I care about you. Pull over here. Here! Stop the car, Bob! You're not the only guy that serves burgers. I'm gonna be a regular at Dusty's Feedbag now, friend. Come on, Teddy, d Oh, and one more thing three years ago, you forgot a tomato on my burger and I said nothing nothing! Teddy, don't go in there! You don't tell me what to do! Oh, wait, I guess this entrance isn't open. It's around the back. Then just come back here. You Keep driving! Is it around the side or Where am I? Something. It's right there in the front, the huge entrance. I think this door goes Get out of here, Bob! I don't need your help! Boys and girls, girls and boys, future adults of America, it's time for the most important thing in the world the Freezer-Dome finals! Only one of you will go home with this! I want that belt. And I'm not gonna fall for your little tricks, girl. I wouldn't try to trick you, Zeke. Ding! Ow! Oh, wait, wait, wait! I got something in my eye. Hold on, hold on. All right, I guess I'll just take a seat here, bend my little knees down Ha! Just kidding! Hey, hey, you had to try. You know why? 'Cause you're tiny! Ah! You're home early. What, did you pull a hammy? No. Long story. Where's Linda? Downstairs, I think. Mike, what are you doing? That's weird. I'm normally over there. I thought you were with Teddy. Uh, he's at Dusty's Feedbag, his new favorite restaurant. Oh, that's not good. Why? You haven't heard of the Belt Buckle Belly Buster? They serve that there. Belt Buckle Belly Buster? It's a five-pound burger. If you eat the whole thing in a half hour, it's free, and you get your picture on the wall. Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no. Teddy! So you said it's cool to have more ice cream? You're gonna get destroyed. Throw in the towel! Never. Never, never, never! Finish her! Why you putting up a fight, you tiny sweet angel? Take your medicine, girl. Just go down. I'm s I'm still totally gonna win, so shut your mouth. You might have beaten me, Louise, but blood is thicker than ice. But not actually. Time to unleash the beast. Now's your chance! Oh, God. Oh, that's what killed the dinosaurs. That's awful. Ooh. Zeke is down! Louise, you win! Yay!  Everybody kiss my butt   Everybody kiss my butt   Kiss her butt   Everybody kiss my butt   Everybody kiss her butt   Everybody kiss my butt   Everybody kiss her butt  Yeah! Teddy! Bob. You didn't order the Belt Buckle Belly Buster, did you? Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. But I did. Excuse me. Uh, are you Dusty? Dusty? Uh, no. There's no Dusty. Uh, this is a chain, pal. I'm Kevin. I'm the manager. Listen, Kevin, you can't serve this guy your five-pound burger. Oh, okay, making a note. I can't serve someone a burger in my own restaurant. Look, Teddy is Well He has the biggest heart of anyone I know. Both because he's incredibly sweet but also because it's full of cholesterol. Which is why you can't serve him that huge burger he-he might not survive it. Well, you know what? Big boy paid for it, so order up! Good God, look at that thing. Oh. Let me at it! You're not giving him that burger. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, let that Belly Buster through. Please take the burger back to the kitchen, ma'am. It is so weird that you think you work here. I just Damn it, I don't remember hiring a fat Burt Reynolds. Look, this burger is not going anywhere. This is just fantastic. I'm gonna get to throw fat Burt Reynolds out of my restaurant! Oh, yeah? Well, I can get tough, too. And I'm staying. Guys, come on. Don't fight over me. Wait, is that what's happening? Bad news for you, Kevin. I've just been through a bunch of kick-ass training, so if you think you can just Oh, no Oh, yeah? Well, I hope you got trained to get your ass kicked! Actually, I did! Oh, God! Here comes the glass! Thanks for coming! Are you okay, Bobby? Real glass hurts so bad. Am I bleeding? Not, like, too much. And the concrete wasn't padded. It was so hard when-when I landed on it. Before you pass out, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. I have so much glass in myself. I'll get you out of here, buddy. All right, let's go to the hospital, Teddy. No, Bob. Let's go home. No. No, we're gonna go to a hospital Shh, shh, shh. Home it is, Bob. Here we go, almost home. I'll just see if someone else can take me. Hey, even though I'm not your best friend, I really appreciate what you did. Look, I-I'm sorry I said you're not my best friend. Because you are. I am? Yeah, I mean, it depends on how you define it. You technically are my best friend. But, I mean I might meet Bup, bup, bup stop right there, Bobby. But, I mean, I don't know who Yeah. Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob. Eventually I Enough. Can I carry you across the threshold? All right. Ow. Watch your head. Sorry. Aw, my little beat-up Bobby. Where's that belt from? Where's all the food? Shh, shh, shh, shh, shush. Is the ice helping? Pretty refreshing, right? Yes, Tina. How 'bout this? Is this helping? Thanks, Teddy. Yes, it's good. How 'bout some smelling salts? Oh, God. Come on! Oh, you come on. That fart's a winner and you know it! All right, let me smell it again. Yeah, you're right.  He crashes on your couch when he loses his job   Guy pulls a knife and you jump in front   You take the blade right in the gut   Ow!   Then he holds your hand till the medic comes   Yeah   You feed him soup when he breaks his jaw   You help him pee when he has that thing   He's your best friend!   He crashes on your couch when he loses his job   He helps you pee when you've got that thing   He's your best friend   Your best friend!"
"(birds squawking, gobbling) Whoa. Those are the birds? W-why they making that noise? Hell if I know. They've been screeching that way for the last eight hours. Where are they from? They came from a horrible crappy farm, okay? Just sign the form. I want to get out of here. Those birds give me the creeps. Come on, how bad can it be? They're just a bunch of cute little birdies. They're probably hungry. Yeah. Here you go, buddy. You want some pretzel? (screams) My hand! My hand! Not your beautiful hand! (shrieking) TINA: Whoa. Look out, everyone. Dangerous curves ahead.  Turkey trot, looking hot  Do you like these pants I got?  Ha-ha! Do you? Bob, do you? Yes. I like them. They're fine. I love them. Wait, wait. Let me put my belt on. You sure you got enough water, Mom? Hey, you got to stay hydrated. Plus, look how little they are! So tiny. Aw! Ooh, can't wait to get out there. running with us. Mm. It's gonna be like the running of the bulls but cute and safe! Mm-hmm. And we'll be on the half-priced rides having full-priced fun. Dad, are you still mad at us for going to the festival? Mad!? No, I'm thrilled! Because you were kind of mad the other day. What? No, I was I wasn't. Oh, right! 'Cause that's what Thanksgiving is for, running around with a bunch of birds and going on rides! Well, fine! Go! But you know what? I'm not making dinner! He's taking this pretty well. No, you're crying! I just calmly said that if you all go to Fischoeder's dumb festival instead of spending the day here, I will not be making dinner. Day off for old Bob. No big deal. No big deal! The turkey baster is in the drawer, probably pretty happy not to work, and so am I. All right, come on. Don't want to be late for the Turk-tacular Turkey Town Festival and Turkey Trot. (kids cheer) (whoops) Fine! You all go have a Turk-tacular time. So, we'll bring home some Chinese food? Yup! Or whatever you want for Thanks I mean, regular dinner. Okay, don't start a brothel while we're gone. Just kidding, you can. And no making a fort out of the couch cushions. Just kidding, you can. But don't turn that fort into a brothel. Just kidding, you can. Oh, my God, just I mean, it's illegal, but I know. Just leave. Nice stems! Thank you. I'm wearing hose to compress my varicose veins. Teddy! I didn't know you were gonna run. Oh, I'll probably walk. I just wanted to see the turkeys. I worked on a turkey ranch one summer, when I was 14. I learned a lot about life. And a lot about turkey feces. Sounds like a magical summer, Teddy. Now let's hit the rides! We're not gonna get whiplash just standing here! Good luck, Mom. Bob at home, cooking away? Nah. He's boycotting Thanksgiving this year. (gasps) What? Yeah. But Bob loves Thanksgiving. I know. He's mad that we all wanted to come here instead of sitting around on the couch all day, waiting for food. Poor Bob. What a tragedy. Well, the real tragedy is that I don't have time to get nachos before we start. You know what? Maybe I do. So, I say we start on the Scramble Pan and work our way back through Violent Mountain and then the Bruise Cruise. I wouldn't mind a trip on the Tickle Boat. But, Gene, they closed it, remember? That guy died. Oh, right. But what a way to go! Yeah. Scramble Pan it is! This is great? Not celebrating Thanksgiving is kind of great. I like it. I'm alone. I can do whatever I want. I could sit in my not-usual spot on the couch. I could even cross my legs, and no one would make fun of me. Felix? Yes? Have all the turkeys been fed? We aren't going to have a repeat of the unfortunate finger nibbling incident? No, Calvin. The turkeys are fine. And the chickens. And the ducks. And the geese. ""Geese""? You were supposed to get You had one thing to do! - One! - I tried! Turkeys are scarce right now, for some reason! Oh, I wonder why that could be! Oh, I'm sorry I let you down again by buying a bunch of dangerous birds that (amplified): (gasps) Oh, my God! The mic is on. - Hi! - Oh, ho! I hope you all enjoyed those Thanksgiving jokes we were just making. (both laugh uncomfortably) A little light Thanksgiving humor. Oh, I love humor. I do love to laugh! Now, on behalf of myself and my brother Calvin, we'd like to welcome you all to the first annual Turk-tacular Turkey Town Festival! All right! Is everybody ready for some poultry in motion? (gobbling) Those birds don't sound right. Hey, Regular Sized Rudy. I didn't know you were a scramblin' man. I'm not usually, but since my parents are divorced, I gotta have two dinners, so I'm trying to make myself throw up breakfast. One time I had two dinners because Ollie was too sick to eat his. I had malaria! Let's quit yakkin' and get crackin'! Mickey, come on, let's do this! Set it to maximum! Okay, hold onto your heads like this so your necks won't break! And now, the beginning of a new Thanksgiving tradition that's fun for the whole family. The Running of the Turkeys etcetera. On your mark get set go! (gobbling) (crowd clamoring) (laughing) Ow! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Linda! Run! Run! Run! (woman screams) Oh. Oh (runners screaming, clamoring) Pretty good, pretty good. I'll try right over left now. Mm, yup, yup. Also good. (runners yelling, clamoring) (man screams, chicken squawks) Oh, ah, no! Birds! Birds! Birds! Birds! Excuse me! Excuse me! Make way, make way! Sorry. Hey Coming through! Here we go, pardon us. (panting) Oh! (squawking) (Linda grunting) (yelling) (groans) What? What happened? Aah! I'm short and wiggly! Ooh! I'm tall and wiggly. Oh, oh, it's a fun mirror. It's a fun mirror. Aah! Linda! Aah! Linda, it's me, Teddy! From your town! Teddy? Wha-What's going on, Teddy? How did I get in here? When the birds attacked, most people got away, but you got knocked out by this freaky one-eyed cyclops turkey. So I picked you up and carried you here. - Whoa! How long have I been out? - A lot's changed. We don't have to start repopulating the Earth yet, but eventually we might have to do just that. - I don't know - Teddy! How long have I been in here? - Five, maybe six minutes. - Oh. Oh, my God, the kids! Where are the kids?! But I'm a vegan! Aah! LOUISE: Ugh! I can't believe Mickey left us here! Those birds are getting awfully close. I hope they don't have tickets for this ride! We got to get off this thing. Andy, Ollie, you seem like you're up for a challenge of getting off the ride and shutting it down. We'll try anything. Yeah! I tried shrimp at my aunt's house! Great. Go get 'em! (both grunting) Oh, what happened? We travelled through time! I guess I'll give it a whirl. Literally. (grunting) whoa! Hey. Welcome back. We're gonna die like we were born. Spinning around in an egg! That really makes you think. This is great. Don't have to keep getting up to baste. Baste not, want not. You get it? Yes. I don't have to storm the Baste-ille. Eh. Get it? Kind of. It was a prison in France. The Bastille, and I said ""Baste-ille."" Oh. I'm here live at the wharf where today's Turkey Trot turned into turkey terror. What exactly happened in there today? I assure you it wasn't that bad, really. I mean, people overreacted, that's all. Those birds went crazy, man! They tried to kill us! (grunting) Hey! That man is clearly insane. You saw his outfit! So, you closed the gates to keep the birds in? That's right. Their wings are clipped. Mm-hmm. That means that they're contained. But what about the people? Was anyone left inside? No, that would be a PR nightmare. Which we are not having today. No, thank you. No, today was nothing less than a total success. There's your headline! Yes. Write that down. We're on live television. Then make it into a graphic. A fun one that spins in. (whooshing) Total success! - Yeah. - We'll get right on that. Okay. Well, that went well. Yes. I think it did, too. Should we go home for dinner? - Yes, I am starving. - Yeah. Did everyone get out, by the way? - Uh no. No, no. - Ooh. I mean, they were screaming when I closed the gates, so I don't think so. (laughs) But who's gonna believe them, right? Oh, ooh, we're still recording! - Oh, dear Lord! - Well, look at that. - Yep. - Happened twice now. Oh well. Look at 'em. Where'd they come from, poultry prison? Yeah, this is bad. Their pecking order's all messed up. What? ""Pecking order""? What are you talking about? Every turkey group has one guy who can peck everyone, then the guy below him who can peck everyone except for the top guy, and so on until the sad sack who can't peck anyone. Oh, that's terrible-- it's like the ladies on The View. Yeah, with all these birds and people mixed in, they don't know what to do. They're pecking everything! It's chaos! Well, we still got to go find the kids. Let's just tiptoe past them. Ready? Ready. (both yelling, turkeys gobbling) Run! (both grunting, panting) It's him-- Cyclops! That's the one who knocked you down earlier. Oh, God, he hates me! (gasps) Oh, my God! - I know what's happening! - What? We rejected Thanksgiving and now it's attacking us! That's crazy, Lin-- these turkeys are just all mixed up. They were keeping them with other birds. It's biology, not hocus pocus. Oh, I love that movie! Oh, how are we ever gonna find the kids? MICKEY (over P.A.): They're on the Scramble Pan. Oh, my God! The birds have learned to talk! No, no! - It's me, Mickey. - Mickey? Mickey?! The kids are on the Scramble Pan? What? I-I can't hear you. - I said the - Turn on your microphone. - What? - Here. (amplified over P.A.): Uh, da. My kids are on the Scramble Pan? Yeah, I, uh, saw them. As I was leaving them there, and, uh, running over here to hide. You abandoned my kids? Eh sort of. But, uh, you know, they're safer on the ride, so I kind of did the right thing, if-if you think about it! (gobbling, squawking) Oh, man. You can only eat an animal for so long. It's the turkeys time to rule the Earth now. We had our chance and we blew it. No, it's the pecking order! It's the spirit of Thanksgiving! - That's crazy talk! - Don't call me crazy. - That's not crazy talk. - Guys, guys, guys, guys! - I didn't say you were crazy. - We got to stop fighting! We're turning on each other. This is exactly what they want! We gotta get the kids, Mickey. You gotta come with us. We need your help to turn off the ride. I would love to do that, Linda. But I'm actually really comfortable here, hiding in these stuffed animals. I just feel safe with these guys, I'm sorry. - That looks nice. - Oh! That gives me an idea! Mickey, we're coming over! Hey, daytime whiskey. Want to meet my CD collection? I feel like you guys would hit it off. Donna Summer? It's Summer time. (slow, sultry pop intro plays) DONNA SUMMER:  Dim all the lights, sweet darling   'Cause tonight it's all the way   Hey, baby   Turn up the old Victrola   Gonna dance the night away  Gene, Tina, Louise! Hey, wait, is that Mom? Yes! She said my name first! Mom! Help! - All right, Mickey, turn it off. - Can do. Oh, shoot-- I threw the key into the ocean. - You what? - I didn't want the birds to get it. We can't let this technology fall into their hands. Is there another way to turn it off? Wait! There's a drunk operator override switch on the ride! - What?! - MICKEY: All the rides in the park have them. In case the operator gets drunk and goes on the ride, leaving no one to turn it off. Oh, smart. Okay, here I go. Just like turning off a bicycle. Oh, God, I'm gonna barf. Guys, I can do this. Oh, God. So dizzy. Oh, God, this is bad. Aah So nauseous! Whoa Seriously?! We've been on this thing for a freaking hour, and no one's barfed. Gene even had a snack. Looks like it's up to Mama. (Linda retches) Holy moly, this thing cannot be safe for children. But you adults seem to be doing really well with it! If only I had something to throw at the switch. Oh, my God. My water babies. (gags) Good-bye, baby bottle. Little Karen. LINDA: Okay, no problem. I-I got nine more. Okay, this is the last one. Little Timmy, you were always my favorite. Please let someone else do it. I can do it! (buzzes) - Yay! - Nice! Way to go, Rudy! Rudy-- one, asthma-- zer (gasps) Are you okay, my babies? Yep, I'm probably always gonna move in little circles like this, though. Uh-oh. Looks like we've got company. Bad company. And not the band! Probably. (gobbling, squawking) (siren wailing) Everyone relax, we're here. Those birds are crazy-- look what one of them did to my nightstick. Please step aside. Let us take care of this, all right? Who's in control? - Animal Control! - Animal Control! Open 'em up! (screaming) DONNA SUMMERS:  It's all the way  BOB (singing along):  Oh, baby  Turn on that old Victrola  Gonna dance the night-- it's so bright   Okay, here we go!  (siren whoops) LINDA: Oh, God, we're surrounded. REGULAR SIZED RUDY: Who wants to be in charge of my epi-pen? I'm allergic to geese and ducks! I will not invite you to my duck-duck-goose party, then. Understood. (whooping, hollering) LINDA: Teddy, what are you doing? I'm whooping and hollering. This is how I used to get the turkeys to follow me on the farm. (whoops) Save yourselves. (hollers) Honor my memory, Linda! - Remember my name! - Teddy! Don't try to stop me, Louise. I just remembered your name, it's Teddy! Right. I'll never forget his incredible legs. They looked like hotdogs. We have to get to the front gate. Help must be there by now. Whew! Great dancing, Bob. Time to reward myself with some beer. Oh, hello, uh, turkey baster. How-how-how are you? Good, good. Uh, yeah, good. I-I-I'm doing really good. Yeah. That's funny, I was just, uh I was, I was just talking about you. Uh, well, uh It was good to see you.

A-Are you happy now? Yeah, yeah? That good? Do you want it to come out? You want to do this right now? You want to do this right now? That's a cl that's classic. That's classic you, turkey baster! Classic you. Not fitting in the drawer. Deliberately not! (laughs) That's great. Oh, come on. Don't look at me like that, turkey baster. Don't look at me like that. I I didn't want this! You think I wanted this?! But I didn't! I didn't. This isn't what I wanted. I-I never wanted to be apart from you. It was all an act. It was it was a lie. (sniffles) Oh, God. That's so much snot. (sniffles) You know what? I'm gonna do it. You're right, turkey baster. I'm Bob. I make dinner. It's not too late. The grocery store's open for another hour. We can still do this! Let's go! Let's go! Get up! Get I can't get Oh, my God! I (straining) Let's get up, drunk! I am dizzy! I'm really dizzy. Oh, my God. I gotta sit down. Give us give us a minute. COP: Please remain indoors. (siren whooping) I repeat, there's been a poultry-based disturbance. Please remain indoors. Poultry! Oh, come on! Everyone, get behind there. (moans) There's no one here. No one came for us. (moans) No one even cared. (moans) We're all gonna die here. We're all gonna die. (gibbers) - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Thank you. Well, I've decided to go join the birds. I eat lots of bread already, and I'm tired of fighting. Good-bye. I'll miss you, but I understand. (motor rumbles) What is that? I know that sound. Wait a minute It can't be. It is. The old Tickle Boat. I hope you guys aren't ticklish. Because of the boat Tickle Boat. Son of a bitch. I was thinking of that line the whole way here. Pretty good, right? Pretty good. Hey, can we get in? LINDA: We're coming, Bobby. (chickens clucking) ""Went to store real quick. Love forever, Bob."" That's a perfectly good note. That doesn't sound drunk at all. LINDA: We're almost there. Hey, look-- I'm giving those birds the bird. (laughs) Mom, Mom, can we do it, too? Uh, yes. Just today, 'cause it's a holiday. Like this. (grunts) (cheering) LINDA: Up, up, higher, higher. Whoa LOUISE: Oh, I feel it. It's so insulting. Never do that again. (humming casually) (turkeys gobbling) This is fun, the two of us. We should go on more walks. (horn honking) Happy Thanksgiving friendly guy. (man shouting) Hey, careful. I think that guy was drunk. Hello? Huh, that's weird. Okay, just gotta grab every single thing for dinner. That's no problem. (turkeys gobbling in distance) Bye, Andy. Bye, Ollie. Happy Thanksgiving. Go, go, go, go, go! I'm thankful that you saved Ollie's life. I'm thankful you saved Andy's life. Now, get out of here! LINDA: Bob? Bobby, we're home! We're sorry! We didn't mean to leave you all alone - on such a big - TINA: Dad? If you're hiding, that's fun. He's not hiding. Aw, giblets. We're going to get Daddy at the store. Rudy, honey, are you sure you don't want us to drop you off at home? I'm going with you. I kind of want to see how this one ends. (inhales) Oh, sweet Rudy. You probably won't live to see the end. Oh. There you are. The one that almost got away. Hello. Oh, whoa. You're an actual turkey. That's standing there. And you have only one eye. Not that that's bad. He-he was like this when I found him. 'Cause it's a grocery store. W-What are you doing here? (whispering): Okay, everyone follow me. (Tina moans nervously) (Bob screaming) - Dad! - Run! Run! Oh, my God, it's Cyclops! (Teddy shuddering) What the hell is happening?! We didn't do Thanksgiving right, and we didn't listen to you, and now Thanksgiving's attacking us! - That makes sense. - No, it's biological! No it's the beginning of a turkey revolution, Bob. We got to pick sides. Ow! He pecked me! Holy crap, that hurts. (nervous moaning) Oh, God. The final ""peckoning."" Pecked! That's it-- pecked. I think Teddy was right! - I was? - And I know what to do. - You do? - Teddy was right?! (grunts) Ow! Lin, what are you doing?! I'm getting to the top of the pecking order. Linda, you're a genius. - Right? - Ow! Damn it. Son of a bitch. - Ow. - Oh! Aah! (yells, grunts) Whoa, did that actually work? Stand back, let's see. (gasps) I'm the alpha turkey. Yeah, that's what I thought. Go stuff each other. To the Tickle Boat! Wait, the Tickle Boat that killed that guy? Yeah. Let's go. Go, go, go, go. - Come on, go. - All right. Move, move, move, out, out, go, go, go. BOB: Well, everyone, here's to us. We've been through so much in the last here's to us. Wait, stop, wait, wait. Uh-huh. I want to say: Here is to Bob on his favorite day. Bob! Yes! LOUISE: Bob! - Yay, great. - Yes! - Thank you. - Yes! And here's to Linda, queen of the turkeys. She really knows how to peck people. - Yay! - Aw - Hear, hear. Queen of the Peckers. - Aw - Nice. And speaking of turkey-- who wants some? Wait, no one wants turkey? - Not so much. - I just don't think it's appropriate. Probably never ever again. I can still smell 'em, Bob. They're inside my mind nose. - I'll make spaghetti. - Yeah! I can't have pasta, but I'll eat a bowl of sauce. I'll make sauce. Fine, I'm putting on Donna Summer, though. Who's Donna Summer? Oh, Rudy, you are gonna love her. Mmm. Mmm. Well, Felix, should we do the wishbone? Yes, I guess we shou (clattering) - What was that? - What was what? Come do the wishbone. Come, come on. No, no, no. I heard something outside. You didn't hear that? What was that? Come I wish you would come do the wishbone. All right I guess I win. (screaming)  There's been a change   Inside my life   And I just wanna let you know   I've got my finger on the trigger   Love is in control   Yeah, ho!   I've got my finger on the trigger   I ain't lettin' go   Mama used to tell me   Girl, you better load your gun up right   She said, ""You, you gotta come out smokin'   Hit it with your best shot every time"
"I want to give a big Chuck Charles thanks to all you little people for coming down to this year's Wharf It Down Food Festival, which, for so many years, has been a strange, slightly sad event, where artisans try to sell specialty foods. But not this year, thanks to me, Chuck Charles, and our 1st Annual Best Burger Contest! Now, we've met our contestants, we've explained the rules of this really, truly, simple event. But the only thing we haven't done is start the clock. Here we go All right, Bob. Let's do it, let's win! Win! Win! Win! Lin, please, Let's go! take it down a notch, okay? Or five? Kids, come on, cheer for your father. Cheer! Cheer! Cheer! Lin, stop. Cheer. Dad, big smile, big energy! That's it, doll. Hey, you're sweating too much already, buddy. Pace yourself. Go, Mom and Dad! I mean, stay there and cook, don't go anywhere. Sorry if I'm being confusing. Okay, come on. Go! Cook! Cook! Cook! Cook! Let's check in with our contestants. Skip Marooch! Uh, am I saying that right? Yes, Skip. Great! So, you're from Pakistan, you've got a successful restaurant, you're on a book tour. Guy, what can't you do? Complain everything is going so well. This guy. So, what are you making today? I already love you. Well, today, I will be making a pomegranate and green chili chutney burger with my grandmother's special spice blend. Yum and yum. She always told me, ""Put spice on everything."" She also said, ""I hate Mondays,"" but she never got credit for that. I would love to meet her. Ah, too late. Oh. Sheesh. I know we're here for Bob, but it's hard to root against that guy. He is likeable. Shush! I can't hear them cooking. Skip Marooch I can't believe we're competing against that guy. He has a book; I read it. I mean, I mostly read it. I looked at all the pictures. Uh, why did I think this was a good idea? You know what? I'm signing up. We're doing it! Do it! We're doing it! This feels good! Do it! Quiet! I don't know what kind of ""doing it"" you're talking about, but you're too loud! I really hate contests. This is why we made a ""no signing up for things while drunk"" rule. Wha? Gene never would've taken ballet. Look at Skip over there. I-I don't think we can win this. It's-it's like I'm Rocky and he's Apollo Creed. That's good! Rocky always won. Rocky lost in the first movie, Lin. Oh But he walked up all those stairs. That's not fair. And let's get a few words with Bob ""The Slob"" Belcher. Hi. That's not my nickname. Well, it is now, everyone heard it. Bob and I have a bit of a history, folks. I graciously allowed him onto my morning talk show, and in turn, he got me fired! I didn't get you fired. Linda did. Hi, Chuck. So, what stupid burger are you making, Bob? Okay, well, it's not stupid; It's smart. I call it the Bet It All on Black Garlic Burger. It's made with Stupid name. What? Stupid name. It's not Oh, my God. I-It's made with black garlic. Uh it's a fermented garlic; It comes from Korea. Don't blame Korea for your stupid burger, Bob. Not fair to them or burgers. I-I'm not blaming them The Stupid Black Garlic Burger. Put it up on the screen. Oh, my God. Eh, we made it up. Look, we're on the screen. Chuck hates us. No It's okay, I hate him, too. God, this was a bad idea. No It's fun. It's fun Over here, we have the Prince of Pizza trying to become the Chancellor of Cheeseburgers Jimmy Pesto. Thank you, Chuck. Uh, Jimmy Pesto's is known for our family-friendly atmosphere, festive drink specials and Italian-flavored foods. All right A-A-And after I win this contest today, we're also gonna be known for our Oregano Burger! All right! And what's in that? Just a ton of oregano. The Big O! Don't say ""Big O."" What? A all right, I won't say anything, then, ever. Sounds horrible. I guess it's just us and Skip here. All right, time to break out the black garlic. Lin? You got it! It's not in here. Wait. What? Not in the cooler. It's empty. Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap, crap, crap. Crap! Gene, can you go to the kitchen and grab the black garlic? On it! What color is it? - It's black, Gene. - Yup. Wait. What's black? The garlic. On the counter. In the kitchen? Where I am? - Are you?! - I think so. Well, then, yes, on the counter. Okay. I feel really good about this, Dad. I feel great about it. Way to go, everybody. Gene! Dad?! What are we doing? I asked Gene to get the black garlic from the kitchen the single most important ingredient in my recipe and we're looking at an empty cooler! Okay, don't freak out. Hi. Hi, everyone. Hi. Hi. Hello. I'm not freaking out! He's fine. He's he's silly. Just put something else on the burger. What about a Oh, a-a granola bar burger! Half a granola bar burger. Yeah, yeah, let-let's do that. That's a great idea. Great! I'll start chopping it up. Ha, ha, ha! Oh, it's old. Oh, that's okay. That's fine. We can make it. Linda. Oh, my God, I wasn't serious. Look at the screen. It says ""Stupid Black Garlic Burger"". I'm pretty sure we can't beat Skip Marooch if we don't have black garlic on our black garlic burger! Okay! Geez. Kids! Kids, come here! The answer is yes, you look terrified. Is that the question? Listen! Gene, what did you do with the black garlic? It's not in the cooler! Calm down, Dad. What is black garlic? Ugh! I need you guys to go back to the restaurant, get the black garlic and bring it back here as fast as you possibly can! No problem. It's on my way, anyway, bro. No, no! Tina, Louise, go with your brother. - And hurry! The clock is ticking. - Hmm. Let's talk more about this clock that's ticking. Tick, tick. What do want, Louise? Louise?! Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick We never have to work again. You can have the day off tomorrow. Deal! Great. Here. Aah! Don't throw things! We don't throw things! We don't catch them, either. We're not in the circus, Dad. Yeah! Just go! Hey, Belcher boppers! Mickey! Wait, you drive a pedi-cab? I thought you worked at Wonder Wharf. Oh, I just started driving this during festivals and weekends. Make a lot of money hauling around lazies and drunks. We are both. Give us a ride! Hey, you kids don't want a ride from toothpick legs over here. Check out these pedal monsters, huh? Wow. It looks like a bunch of snakes inside a leather armchair. Yup. Back off, Manny. This is my fare. Oh, yeah? Well this is my turf, rookie. Here. Hey! My first turf war! Whoa! Oh, hold on, let me Okay, well, I-I think we'll go old-school pedestrian. See you guys! Good luck with your turf war. Thanks! Whoa! So, Bob, you look sweaty. Think you have what it takes to beat the competition? I personally doubt it. I'm not sweating. Oh, I am. Okay. I, uh, I was just prepping. Normal, everything's fine. We've got all our ingredients, Chuck. All of 'em. Unnecessary information, totally boring. I'm gonna go ahead and talk to Skip. There he is, guy! Tell us more about your grandmother's secret spice blend. All right, well, there is saffron in it. Oh, no, I told you the secret! I have to kill you now! Die, die, die! Warm, charming, and funny, strong hands, to boot! That's why he's got a book and Bob doesn't. Oh. Ah, there you are, my stinky princess! We're getting you out of here! Come with us! Hey, there's my back-scratching spatula! What are you doing in the kitchen? Aah! Gene, you're crushing it! What? Oh, no! My shirt! Aah! You just cost Dad the competition! Forget Dad. You just cost us our day off! Maybe it's still good! I'll scrape it off with my back scratcher. Ooh, it works on your front, too. Mm. What's so hard to understand about, ""I saw the black garlic, ""but then I saw my spatula back scratcher, ""and when I reached for it, your black garlic got smeared all over my belly""? Oh, my God. Gene, put Tina on the phone. She's pretty big. It'd be easier to put the phone on Tina. Gene! This is Tina. Tina, listen to me. Go to your mom's bra drawer and find the cash she thinks is secret. There's no money in there! There's no money. Take $20 and go to that specialty food market on Third. Uh, Fig Jam. Uh aren't there any other places we could go? It's the only place in town that has black garlic. Hurry. We're down to 12 minutes here. Dad hung up on me, but it's okay because I know he loves me, and he says we have to go to Fig Jam. Fig Jam? Fig Jam. We'll take this dark chocolate bar with bacon and red pepper flakes, please. Okay, that'll be $13. What?! No, we're just getting one, so this should cover it. Here you go. Mm. You know, I think you three may be in the wrong store. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable shopping at the gum ball machine at the gas station. Are you kicking us out? No. I am strongly suggesting that you take your business elsewhere, what little of it you have. Hmm. All right. But when a rich john sets me up in style, I'm coming back. And you better hope you don't work on commission. Yeah, where'd you import this chocolate from anyway, your butt? No. Yeah, and where'd you import these sea salt caramel crisps from, your butt? Oh, Belgium. That's it. You're banned. We ban you. Get out of the store! I will not get out of my store! You get out! You are banned! You're banned! You're banned! You're banned! You're banned! You're banned! You're banned! We have to try, guys. If we don't get this black garlic, Dad is going to lose, and our family will be dishonored. It's not like we've got a whole bunch of honor to spare, is it? No. No. Let's go! Oh, wow, Skip Marooch is cooking up something special. It smells good, and he looks good doing it. Scratch that. He looks great. Thank you! Moving on. Let's see how Jimmy Pesto's doing. Done! Ding! Ooh, what? Wow, Jimmy has plated his burgers with ten minutes left. Course, those burgers may get cold before the judges have a chance to Ah! Da-da-da. Oh, okay, brought a little heat lamp with him. Yeah. Heat lamp adds a little flavor. And it keeps my lizard warm! Would you?! Come on! Let's check in on Bob, because we kind of have to. Lots of chopping. His bald spot's getting bigger and shinier. Hair probably falling out all over his food. What a disgusting creature. I'm catching all the hair before it even comes close to the food. God, it is coming out. Your wife is a lucky woman, Bob. Thank you! Maybe he won't recognize us. Banned! Whoa, hey, come on. Let's not do this again. Let's start fresh. What'd you say your name was? I didn't. It's none of your business. Hey, don't look at my nametag. It's Ray. I saw it. Aw, Ray, I love that. Ray of sunshine. Ray of hope. We need some emergency black garlic; It's a black garlic emergency. Oh a black garlic emergency. Yeah, so Well, in that case No! A ""no"" is just a ""yes"" upside-down. Get out. We'll pay double. Really? Yes. All right, $16. Aw, that's the ray of greed I remember. Gene, where's the cash? We got to go. Come on, we got to go. A cool older kid with a skateboard asked me for a dollar. So, I gave him the $20 and he's skating right back with the change. Ugh! Gene, you fool. He's not coming back. Never trust a boy with a skateboard. They're too fast. Hey, Ray, friend, uh, new plan: I'm gonna give you Gene, and then I'll take Out now. Banned. Banned! Psst. Psst. Time for Operation Black Garlic Down Freedom. What's that? Hey! We'll come back and pay for it later! Thanks for all your help, Ray! Get back here! Mickey! Hey, kids! Hey. Hi, Ron. Hey, move over, buddy. Aw, sorry, gang, I'm kind of in the middle of a fair here. I was going to the library. Taking a pedi-cab there is my weekly splurge. But we stole something. Oh, why didn't you say so? Where to? Take us to the food festival and step on it! Stop! Ho, ho, ho there, cowboy. I will give you 20 bucks if you catch up to that pedi-cab. Wait, what? You mean that spaghetti-legged fare thief? Uh yes. Oh. Oh, baby. Mickey, you are going down. Okay. Let's get 'em! Whoa! Let me hold the black garlic. I want to apologize for murdering its brother. No, Gene. I don't think that's a good idea. Yeah, we're trying to get a day off here. Wait, why can't I hold the black garlic? It's just that you always I don't want to say ""screw everything up,"" but maybe Louise does? You screw everything up! Wait, me? This Gene Belcher? It's just sometimes you lose focus. Your name is a verb in this family, Gene. We call it ""Gene-ing out."" I thought that meant taking off your shorts after a good meal. No. I was Gene-ing out at work the other day. I'm Gene-ing out right now. Mickey, no! Mickey, hey! You're taking us to the food festival as fast you can! Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. Oh, my God. I'm a verb. I'm a bad verb. You're a berb. I'm a berb! Eight minutes left until burger judgment day! The kids should've been back by now. We're screwed. Bob, you said you were Rocky. Come on. Start acting like Rocky. Scream ""Adrian."" I-I don't want to scream ""Adrian."" Scream ""Adrian""! Linda, that analogy doesn't work anymore. Rocky's son didn't leave Rocky's boxing gloves at home. Yeah. Rocky's son, huh? Hmm. Well, maybe Eh, forget it. No, what? Wh-What were you gonna say? I'm just saying, you picked our least responsible kid to do the most important thing. Maybe you kind of expected him to screw up. That is ridiculous, Lin. Well forgetting the black garlic sort of lets you off the hook for losing. Like it's not your fault. All of a sudden, you got a built-in excuse for not being the best. That is crazy. That's maybe right? Oh, my God. Oh, it's the kids! ""Got garlic. Broke law. You fix later. On our way. 'Smiley face.'"" Aw, smiley face! Oh, my God. They got it. They're coming. We're gonna have everything we need. No more excuses. No. I'm terrified. So I was ri Linda, you were right. Yes! Right! Me! Aw, you don't have to say that. It's Ray, and he's either getting bigger or closer. Uh-oh, he's got Manny driving him. Don't worry, I'll slow him down. Oh, that was overdue. Why did I do that? Eh, they're throwing stuff at us. Ah, no throwsies, man! Yeah! No throwsies. We got to get this to dad. Go. Go. Get him. Faster. Faster. I am going! I just want you kids to know, I will fight. I will fight Manny or Ray, but I-I prefer to fight Ray, actually, 'cause he's smaller. Nice. Thanks, Ron. Ah, no problem. There's the contest! Mickey, pedal harder. Mow these people down! Oh, no, a train! Beat it, Mickey! Beat it. Ah, damn it! No! Sorry, kids. You're gonna have to run from here. You guys stay here and block. I'll cut through the crowd like a fart through butter. Let me take the garlic. I need this. This is my redemption song. Bob Marley, give me strength! This is a food festival, Gene. It's a distraction minefield for you. Yeah, Gene. Stay here and help me block Ray. It'll be a block party. Okay. Hey, look, that cloud looks like a dinosaur on a thing. Where? Huh? Aah! I can't believe it! Gene made us Gene out! Oh, yeah, I see it. Okay, Gene. Get this black garlic to dad. Don't lose focus. Ooh, muffins. No, don't lose focus! Hi. I'm Ron. I'm blocking you. Where are those kids? Oh, you mean us? Meet your new cankles, Ray. Hi. Where's the black garlic? You'll never get it. It's too far away, and as we've already said, you're cankled. Don't you cankle me! These are good. These are gonna be good. Linda, be my eyes. You see the kids out there? No, I don't. What do they look like? Oh, God. I'm panicking. I'm panicking. Free cupcake-flavored ice cream, served on a waffle! You're killing me! Pizza tacos. Pizza tacos? Ten for one dollar. Don't you tell me ""ten for one dollar."" Robot cake, release your hold on me! So, uh, you work at Fig Jam, huh? I-I-I heard you had great fig jam. Oh, yes, it's delicious. And you'll never know, because you're banned! Aw. Hey, wait a minute. Is anyone even watching Fig Jam right now? Ray, people are probably looting it. A bunch of hippies stuffing truffled cheese in their banjo cases. Hello? Hello? I'm just gonna leave money on the counter. Love your store. Oh, my God. Fig Jam! Fig Jam! That was some mean pedi-cabbing out there, rookie. You got the legs of a mouse but the heart of a lion. My uncle's got the heart of a lion. He got it in Thailand. Thailand, huh? Yeah. They got nice ties in Thailand? I love you, Manny. I'm almost there. Hot Fudge Car Wash. Hot Fudge Car Wash?! No! Oh, it's Gene. Bob, it's Gene. Dad! Gene! I-I'm sorry I screwed up today! I I'm sorry I screw up all the time! No, Gene, you didn't screw up. I screwed up by trusting you. Wait, that came out wrong. I'm confused, are you trying to make me feel better? Yes, I am. Before I give you the black garlic, I just want to say one more thing. There's only 45 seconds left, Gene, so I've always admired you. Just give me the garlic, Gene! We'll talk later! Okay. Thank you. Sorry I snapped. Come on, Bobby. You got your gloves, now time to beat Apollo. Adrian! No, not like that. Say it right. What?! I'm saying it right. Adri I don't have time, Lin. Ten seconds left. Some cooks look like they might not make it. I'm talking about Bob. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. I got everything ready. Here we go. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Time's up. Hand off your meat, chefs. We finished! We finished the burgers! Hooray for Bob. He managed to somehow do what he does every day for a living. What a champion. That's my Bobby! Chefs. Pre sent your burgers to the judges. Looks like the judges are tasting Jimmy Pesto's burger first. Let's see how he oh, oh, they are spitting it out. Oh, it's cool. Hey, two-for-one pizza night Wednesdays, karaoke Tuesdays, trivia Thursdays. We never card. Come on down! Thank you, Jimmy. Spitting it out bad sign. You can probably go. Ah come on, Trev. Hey, I'm sorry I was so hard on you. Things got a little heated. And not just 'cause of your heat lamp. Ah you said ""hard."" I did. Up top. All right, now they're tasting Bob's idiot burger. Get ready for another spit-out. This is fantastic. The meat is seasoned perfectly, and this black garlic is Oh! Oh This has exquisite mouth feel. Bobby, they loved it! That one's creepy, but he loved it. Oh, my God. Did we just win? I mean, they still haven't had Skip's burger, but And now the last, but most likely the best, from the Cinnamon Stallion, Skip Marooch. This is amazing. This chutney is absolutely, mmm, oh Exceptional mouth feel. Hmm. It might be a little closer than I thought. Okay. Okay, Bob. You got a ""fantastic"" and an ""ooh,"" but he got an ""amazing"" and a really weird moan. And he liked both your mouth feels. I'd say it's a tight race. And now the judges will deliberate. Cue deliberating music, please. You know what? I did my best, I held my own with Skip, and no matter what happens, Lin, And the winner is Skip Marooch! Oh, my God, I feel bad. Oh-oh. Ah, damn it! Piece of garbage! How could we lose?! Are you kidding me?! Okay. Okay. Ah, it's shaped like a burger! I get it! I'm so excited! Skip Marooch, handsomest chef. What about me? Great emcee. Gonna go have a plate of shrimp, a 20-ounce beer and a massage, from my friend, Hank the masseuse Oh, my God. Sorry you lost, Dad. Maybe if I'd gotten you the black garlic sooner, you would have won. No, no. We made the best burger we could, but we lost, and that's okay. I don't need an excuse. I guess Skip was just more charismatic and likeable, Dad. That's right. No! I don't need an excuse. Either way, I'm sorry. Listen, Gene. You may get distracted from time to time, but I love you and I love who you are. And what matters most is Gene? Gene, are you listening?! I am. I am. I love you. I love you, too. But what are those people doing waiting in front of the restaurant? Hmm. People don't wait for our restaurant. Maybe they all need to use the bathroom. Hey, get out of here! Go pee in the bushes like normal people. Are you guys open? We want to try that black garlic burger. Can I have a black garlic burger, too? Skip? What the hell? Yeah. You want to try my burger? Yeah, I smelt it, and now I want you to dealt it. Into my mouth. Come on in. W-We just need a few minutes to get the grill going. Gene, you want to go start the grill? Nope. My day off starts now. And I will be spending the next Bye-bye. Oh. Gene! Yeah? Did you just say ""Hot Fudge Car Wash""? I did. My day off starts now, too. Bye-bye. Whoa, whoa, wait. We have customers. Sorry, Dad. I have to go see a car wash about a fudge. Get Mommy a to-go bucket.  Hot Fudge Car Wash   Hot Fudge Car Wash   Hot, hot, hot, hot fudge   Mmm   Hot Fudge Car Wash   Hot Fudge Car Wash   Hot, hot, hot, hot fudge   Hot Fudge Car Wash   Hot, hot, hot, hot fudge   Hot Fudge Car Wash   Ooh hot fudge!"
"Hey, Bob. Thanks for cooking me. You're pretty good with that spatula; How old are you? Oh, wow, you're like a prodigy. Yeah, I'm pretty good, I guess. That tickles, I like it. Here you go, Henry. What's this? I ordered the usual. Well, well, since Pop's getting his prostate checked, and I'm manning the grill, I thought, why not try the unusual? Ooh. Henry, I present to you ""Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger."" Sour cream, chives, and little fried pickle wheels on the sides that make it look like a car. Vroom, vroom! You know he's a grown man, right? Someone's having fun at work today. Yep, a lot. I came up with a bunch of ideas for specials. The Crispy Brinkley Burger, the Richard Per-Simmons Burger, the Greed is Gouda Burger - Easy, easy, whew. Okay, okay. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry, I got excited. I-I'm just passionate. So that's what a prostate exam is. Did you guys know what it was? I think it's more fun if it's a surprise. Hey, Big Bob, look what Little Bob made. Junior, what is this? It's a ""Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger."" A what you can what my what burger? Henry, did you order this? What'd you order? The usual, but this looks okay. I-I like cars. Try it, Henry, y-you might like it. Don't tell him what to eat, Junior. He didn't order that, he's a tuna melt man look at him. I-I'll take a bite. I'll eat the wheel. Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's my burger-car. Get off. It's nobody's burger-car. We'll make you a tuna melt. Just everybody shush! That's the last time I get my prostate checked. Wrap it up, Teddy. We got to close up. We're going to Big Bob's Christmas Eve party. Ugh, Teddy, eat slower. Actually, that's too slow. Dear Lord Santa, this year, please bless me with a calendar of Australian firefighters holding puppies in casual settings. And bless me with a perm. You only live once; Why not have a little fun up top? And, Santa, bless me with an internship at your company. Preferably something in the flying animal or breaking and entering department, thank you. Kids, I know it's Christmas Eve but I don't think you pray to Santa. Lord Santa, strike him down! Ooh, that reminds me. I'm supposed to go to midnight mass tonight. Either that or midnight basketball. I've got my shorts in the truck. What do you think I should do? Combine them mass-ketball! All right, let's go. Big Bob's Christmas party, here we come. I don't want to go. Plus, is it a party if my dad just works the whole time and charges people? Isn't that just being a restaurant? It's Christmas, he invites us every year, we're going. But we just went two years ago. That was seven years ago. You sure? I remember. I was still breast-feeding. No, you weren't. Not with you. Fine, we'll go, but we're sticking to the 15-minute rule. What? What are you talking about? It-It's that I can only be around my dad for 15 minutes. Then I have to leave before I completely lose it. Well, good luck. I give it three months. I'm gonna go inside. You're a lot fatter than I was at your age. Gotta go. Aw, cute kid. So you named him Gene, huh? Is it too late to change that? I'm gonna leave now. But this is your house. That's okay. Yep, so now Dad only sees Grandpa in 15-minute intervals. It's like speed dating but with your dad. Hey, father issues we all got 'em. I've got mother issues, too. I've even got cousin issues. Beautiful blonde cousin issues. Aw Ew. What? Oh, forget your 15-minute rule. Tonight's the night you and your dad finally patch everything up. Because of  Christmas magic   Christmas magic   This time of year  Okay, stop, stop.  This time of year  Stop, stop, Teddy.  And all the cold hungry people   All those cold hungry people   They're dying in the streets   They're dying in the streets   Me and my family will be warm tonight.  Okay, Lin. Anyway, the rest of us get along great with Pop Pop. I enjoy his opinions on what's ruining America. You know what you should do? You should ask him for $5. He'll give it to you in cash. Okay, fine, fine. We're w-we'll go to Grandpa's. But we're only going for 15 minutes. Teddy, have fun at church. Or basketball. Either way, I'm wearing shorts.  Fa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la   Oh, it's Christmastime again  Guys, guys, did you get presents for Mom and Dad? I got Mom that hip-hop yoga video she wanted. I went in on it. Tina, how much do I owe you? Just kidding, it's on you. Great, that'll be from all of us. So what did we get Dad, Tina? I didn't get him anything. Oh, way to go, T. Gene and I are pulling our weight. Yeah, Tina. Sorry, it's just been a crazy season. Well, we can't put ""sorry"" under the tree, can we? We'll just give him whatever's in my pocket. A chocolate-covered raisin. Scratch that. A raisin. Crap, this happens every year. Well, we're gonna have to make him a gift at Grandpa's. Mm. There it is. Our restaurant's dad. Hey, look who's here. Hey, Pete. Merry Christmas, Bob and family. Merry Christmas, Pete! You haven't been here in so long, I grew a big white beard. Just kidding, it's a Santa beard. This is my real beard. Keep going! Russian nesting beards! How's your bar? Pete owns the bar next door, remember? Is it still gay, still going strong? Stronger and gayer than ever. That's our motto.  Stronger and gayer than ever!  I just wrote a jingle for you. Hmm. Ha! She's pretty ""singy"" tonight.  Yeah.  Hey, Big Bob's in the back, and I think it's hug o'clock. Huh, kids? I get it. We're coming for you, Pop Pop. Here you go. Merry Christmas, Big Bob. Linda, kids. Boy, you get smaller every year. When do I stop calling you Big Bob and start calling you Old Wrinkly Shriveled-Up Bob? Ha! All right, all right. Sorry. And how are my grandkids doing? I got problems, but nothing five dollars wouldn't fix. Grandpa, you don't look a day over grandpa age. You're a doll, Tina. Thank you. Hey, look what I got here. Who's your favorite president? Bill Pullman! ""Today we fight for our independence!"" Here you go. Oh. Merry Christmas. Thanks, Gramps. Hey, listen. We have an arts and crafts emergency. We need glue, we need paper, we need pasta. We need it, like, yesterday. How many sizes of googly-eyes do you have? I don't really have any of that. But I've got a bunch of crap down in the basement if you kids want to take a look. One man's trash is another man's present for their father. Hey, Junior. How are things? Eh, my prep guy's gone tonight. Went to the hospital 'cause his daughter's having a baby. People can be pretty selfish, I guess. Jerk baby. Linda. Uh, h-hold on here. Bobby, this is going well. Yeah, check back with me in 14-and-a-half minutes. Christmas magic. Stop saying that. No, I don't want to. You sure look slammed tonight, Big Bob. Seems like you could use a hand. If only there was someone here Lin, no. - Who knew their way around the kitchen - Stop. They knew the menu Lin, no. Where to get the cheese No. Knew where that goes. Stop. They knew their way around. Stop it. Like the back of their hand. Like they were raised here. No, no. I-I don't. Yeah, I doubt he'd Bob could help cook. No, I-I don't Ah? I'll get trapped in there It's you father Stop it. It's your father. Shut up. All right! You two bond, have fun! Okay, this is it. I'm gonna give Little Bob his Christmas gift. Everybody ready? Bob Junior! Wh-What's going on? Bobby, you've been working here your whole life. And I'm sure you've been waiting for this day. W-What are you doing? From this point forward, Big Bob's Diner will officially be called Oh, Dad, don't. Bob and Son's. All right! Yeah! The new menus. And Okay, that's gonna say ""Son's."" It's not done yet, but it's great, huh? My cousin's painting it. He's slow, he can only do about a letter a day, but he can spell like a son of a bitch. Like a son of a bitch. Come here, partner. Uh Uh, uh Come on, want to be partners, or what? No? You're welcome. I think Wait, what'd you just say? I said no. I could never be partners with you. You're impossible to work with. What? Oh, boy. Easy, Little Bob. I want to change the menu, a-and you never want to change the menu. And you're so critical. I can't even lift a spatula without you saying I'm doing it wrong. 'Cause you're doing it wrong! L-Let's let the spatula decide. You both call it, a-and we'll see who it goes to. I want to express myself in the kitchen! And when I say that, he makes this weird sound! That sound! What is that?! You're gonna do this? Right now? In front of everybody? You know what? Get out! Take your jokey burger specials and go! Fine! You just gave me a new burger idea. The I'm Sproutta Here Burger. Comes with sprouts. Ah, not that but something else. I thought of a better one! The ""I'd Be Cheddar Off Literally Anywhere But Here Burger!"" Comes with aged cheddar forget it! Forget it! Merry freaking Christmas! Merry Christmas, Little Bob! Lin, this was not the plan. Me cooking with my father at the party was not the plan. We are radically off plan. Bob, calm down. Listen to me. This is a great opportunity for you two to turn your bad blood to glad blood. Here, Bob, have some Christmas magic, eh? Wait, Christmas magic is wine? It's whatever you want it to be. It can be snow or Santa or beer or gin or rum or schnapps. I-I get it. Listen, I've been with him for five minutes, so I'm setting this timer for ten minutes, and then I'm leaving. Well, I'm setting this timer to forever. 'Cause that's how long you and your father are gonna love each other. Talking about your heart, Bob, not your nipple. All right, pastrami with mustard, table three. Uh, w-where's the club sandwich for table two? Right here, Dad. I got a great idea, Big Bob. How about I run the food, that way you can stay in the kitchen and cook with Little Bob. No, no, I-I think Big Bob is fine running the food. That's Look out, table two, here comes Linda with your club! Wait, where's table two? You order a club? Club? Club? Present for Dad, present for Dad, present for Dad. Ooh, cans of beans! Dad loves to drum on beans, right? What about this chair? Dad sits sometimes. Ugh, boring. He'll sit when he's dead, Tina. What if we glue all these mousetraps together, and call it a super trap? What if I make my chair a super chair? Like, if I tape this pad of paper to it, then he could journal. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this a little friendly competition we have here? A little Christmas competition? Whoever gives Dad the best present, wins a A Mistle-Tony! Yes! The most coveted award in gift-giving! Dibs on bringing Mom to the ceremony! Dibs on bringing Dad. Dibs on bringing Dad. Nope, too late. So, who you bringing, Tina? I don't know now. Yeah. So, uh, th-the grill seems good. It's getting to be an antique. Yeah, we all are, you know? Yeah. It-It's a new hood? Five years ago. Good hood? Yeah, pretty good. Pretty good hood. Yeah, I-I got a good hood, too. Ah, that's good. You always said you need a good hood. I never said that. I thought you said that; I that's No one in the history of time has ever said that. ""All you need is a good hood."" I swear I remember you saying that all you need is a good That wasn't me. It was someone else. I don't know why anyone else would say that. Dad's chair is almost done. He'll never have to stand up again. Dad's thirsty; He's got a water bottle. He's cold; Box of matches. Now he's bored. Not anymore. Here's a basketball. And then I can use this dish towel to wipe the floor with you. Because I just won the Mistle-Tony. Um, when you see this trap, you're gonna want to shut yours. Period. End of burn. How's your present going, Little Drummer Gene? Beans, beans, the tragical fruit? The more you drum it, the more you lose? The contest? That we're in right now? Mm-hmm. Like the saying, about the beans, but with, uh, different words. Well, I was gonna empty out these cans to make a better drum sound, but now I think I might soak these old bones in a little bean bath! Gene, you're pulling out of the competition? No. I'm just taking a little siesta to clear my mind. Tina, be a dear and get me two slices of ham to put over my eyes? Hey, Dad, we're probably gonna head out in about, um, have to finish up this last order. What do you think this says? ""Grilled cheese."" Grilled cheese. Huh. That's weird. Wh what? Nah. Nothing. Never mind. It just it says ""grilled cheese"" on the ticket, but maybe you thought it said ""burnt toast,"" I don't know. Oh, my God. Okay, Dad. We're gonna hit the road. How we doing? Good. We're just learning how to make grilled cheese for the first time, for some reason. Oh, hey, look at me! I got a new order over here! Uh, Henry here at the counter says he wants ""the usual."" ""The usual."" Uh yeah? I'll take care of Henry's usual, Bob. You keep burning the grilled cheese. Oh, no, Dad, I'm gonna take care of this. I'm gonna take care of Henry. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the burger I tried to make him when I was 14 and you put me in charge of the restaurant. That's what I'm talking about! Wait, what burger? The Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger, Pop! Okay. Everyone's fine. Talking it out. Here we go! Let's see if he's got any chives. Probably not! Why would he have chives in a restaurant? That would be too much flavor! Oh, I've got chives, buddy. Good. You ready, Henry? What? Stay out of this, Henry! Sorry. You are not making one of your gimmick burgers in my kitchen! Vroom. Vroom. What is that? It's a car sound! That's not a car sound. This is a car sound. That's how you do it. Oh, my God! Al right, stop making that burguer right now! Henry wants the tuna melt! Isn't that right, Henry? No, Pop. Henry wants the Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger he never had a chance to taste because of you! Look, uh, I don't want to cause any trouble here. I'll just eat whatever you put in front of me. No problem, easy breezy. You're getting the tuna melt! You're getting the burger, Henry! Not if I make the tuna melt first! Good luck! Hey, don't box me out. Hey, if you're having a hard time getting to the grill, it's not my problem. And hug. No? Okay. Dad will never walk again. By choice. Nor will he love either of you again. By choice. Guys? Did you hear my trash talking? You can't hurt me, Tina. At this point, I'm more bean than Gene. Nobody talk! Nobody talk. I just need to get one more on here and I win. I win. I win! Oh, you might have won if I was done, but I'm not. What could be better-y than a battery taped to the back of the chair? Game. Set. Match. No! No! No! Uh-oh. Hope you're happy, Tina. Now Dad doesn't get a Christmas present. Looks like Dad just won a bean bath with a little pee in it! Oh, that's something. This'll make Dad's skin look 40 again No! I spilled my beans! I guess the Mistle-Tonys were a bust. Tina, new game. You have ten seconds to find a gift for Dad. Go! Um we could give him this snow globe? It says, ""Oh, snow, you didn't."" Attagirl. Wrap it up, make it look pretty. I'd give you this big, beautiful bow, but then what would I wear? I threw away your garnish! Damn it! Order up! Order up! Lin, take this to Henry! No, Linda. Take this to Henry! I'm not taking anything anywhere until you two make peace! You know what you need? Come on, people! Sing! We can bring these guys back together!  Peace, peace, peace   Peace, peace  Everybody!  Peace, peace  Come on.  Peace, peace, pea  Yeah!  Peace  Yeah, yeah Fine, I'll take it to Henry myself! Then I will, too! - Get your foot out of my -  Ow! Come on, it's Christmas! Here you go, Henry. The usual. Here you go, Henry. The ""Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger.""  Peace, peace  All right, it's not working. Uh, they both look good? You son of a bitch. Take a bite. Eat the tuna melt, Henry. Could I just give the burger, um, a sniff? Henry It's okay to smell. Oy gevalt. Henry Smells good, right? Uh, maybe-maybe just a a quick lick? No, not a lick. Don't do it. Don't lick. Come on. Get it all up in there, Henry. Don't do it, Henry. You know what? Maybe I won't. I knew you wouldn't do it, Henry. Oh, my God, I have to! Henry! Oh What? I'm not chewing. I'm just holding it in my mouth for a second. Ha! You see that, Pop? I'm sorry. Oh Oh, no. I'm swallowing. Oh, it's so good. I'm having another bite. No! I win! I win! Ha! How do you like my joke burgers now, Pop? Okay, Junior. You win. Thanks for coming to my party. Hey, everybody! I'm covered in bean juice! How about I run around and you all try to catch me like a pig at the state fair? Here I go. Try to catch me. No one's trying very hard! Good night, everyone. Merry Christmas. Well, he's out. More bean boy for the rest of you. What?! Why is everybody looking at me?! Bobby, easy, easy. Dad. Dad. Yes, Louise? Everyone looks like they're mad at you. Thank you. Maybe this will cheer you up, Dad. Thanks, Tina. Open it. There's something inside. A snow globe. Yes. Great. Th Wait, where'd you get this? Europe. No, the newspaper. Where-where did you find this? From Pop Pop's basement. It was in his desk. Look at him. He's like a baby, playing with the wrapping paper. Aw. Bobby, what is it? It's the first review of Bob's Burgers. My dad saved it. Oh, my God. That's beautiful. Read it. I don't think so. Read it. I don't want to read it. Read it! ""Unique burgers. Good prices. ""Service leaves something to be desired. But worth the trip."" Hmm. Not great. I mean, it's okay. Oh, Bobby. He does love you, and you drove him out of his own restaurant. On Christmas. Oh, my God. What did I do? I just told you. Oh. Right. Drive your father out on Christmas Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I heard. Oh, my God, that's so sad. So much for Christmas magic. Put this on and come with me. Wait, what? Your dad's in my bar. We're gonna go see him. Go, Bobby. Go. I-I The kids and I will take care of the diner. Go. Yeah, Dad. When a mysterious cowboy/Santa says, ""Come with me,"" you climb on that horse and ride. Also, free hat! I thought this was a disco. That's Wednesdays. Thursdays, we watch Scandal. Tonight's Country Western line dancing. And tomorrow's Christmas or did you forget? I know. I know. Things got a little heated. There he is. Go talk to him. With the hat. Okay. Just leave me alone. Pop, come back to the diner. I'm busy. You're just sitting here. No, I'm not. I'm I'm dancing. Da dancing? You don't dance! Whoa. Get out there, Bob Junior. Pop, will you please just come and talk to me? If you want to talk to your dad, you're gonna have to boot scoot to him. What does that mean? What's ""boot scoot""? It looks like this. Hey-a! Bend bend your knees. I'm-I'm ow, okay. Now shake that pudding. What do you want? I just want to talk to you. You're doing it wrong. Those aren't the steps. Oh, my God. Really? This is why I didn't want to work with you. You have to control everything I do. My cooking, my dancing Not everyone wants to dance exactly the same way. Okay, bad example. You guys are really good at this. I'm here every Friday night. And Thursdays. I love Scandal. Pop, are you? I'm not gay, Bob. These guys are my friends. They eat at my diner; I come here and dance. Oh! Ah, damn, missed it again. Why'd you come over here, Bob? To miss steps? Look, Pops, you are who you are, and I realize now that I should just accept that. That's right. Be yourself, sister. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Not for leaving. And not for starting my own restaurant. But just for how I handled things on the day we broke up. I know it was your way of showing love, it's just I never felt like you were supportive of me. At least, that's what I thought until I found the review you saved. You found that, huh? The kids did. Not a good idea to let my kids into your basement, by the way. Gene took a bean bath. Well, at least somebody's having a good time tonight. Dad, I'm sorry. You didn't deserve to be embarrassed in front of your customers. I did it back then and I did it again tonight. Nope. Wrong time. Listen, I know why you had to go. I can be not great to work with. It was tough without your mom around. You did great on your own. She'd be very proud. You really think Okay, I'm the only guy facing this way now. So I'll turn around. Here we go. Gene, take this chicken noodle soup to table five. On it! Tina, clean up the spill by the bathroom. Bathroom spill is my middle name. Attagirl. Louise, grab some napkins for the kid at the counter. That kid's a mess! I know. Look at your family in there. They really can sling hash when they want to. They don't usually work this hard. You got happy kids. Weird, happy kids. That's nice. You're a good dad, Junior. Thanks, Pops. Let's go back inside, huh? Yeah, let's Hey! Hey! Kids, let us in. Ha ha, no! Open it! This is our restaurant now! It's called Chez Restauranto, and we're Brazilian barbecue! Here. Aw, come on, Tina! Sorry. All right! Christmas magic! My Bobbies are back!  Yay! Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas, Pop Pop!  Christmas magic   Christmas magic   Comes every time each year, whoo!   Christmas magic   And all the cold hungry people   Christmas magic   Fa-la-la-la-la   They're dying in the streets  That can't be good.  Christmas magic   Me and my family will be warm tonight   Aw, yeah, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la."
"Distinguished gray. Undistinguished gray. Hey! Stop counting my gray hairs. We would count Dad's, but his hair is so fragile. No, it's not. Oh, my God, a clump. Mom, can I use this bag to store my Thundergirls uniform? Aw. I still can't believe you quit the Thundergirls. Are you gonna put away your thunder-wear? Congratulations on getting out of that cult, Tina. I was just getting too old for it, I guess. What do you mean ""too old""? Dad, Tina's 13. In Thundergirl years, that's, like, 40. Hey. 40 is the new 38. Yeah, and 38 is the new Yeah. Tina, what happened? There may have been a culture clash between me and the younger girls. I mean, I wouldn't say I was a stick in the mud Look, a stick in the mud! In the old days, that's how a Thundergirl made a sun dial. Oh, that's nice, Tina. Did everyone see Tina's stick? Yes Anyway, now that I have an opening in my schedule, I can spend more time with you guys. Okay, great. Gene, what do we got going on this week? Uh, you've got a bath night I can move around, but you've already moved it twice. Let's cancel it. Tina, you're in. Okay. Well, I know what I'm doing. I'm calling Gretchen at the salon. Say good-bye to the gray, kids. Fine. But I'm keeping this one. - Ow! - Oops, it's a black one. I'll put it back. Ugh, Gretchen, I'm so glad you got rid of those old-lady grays. No more salt with this pepper. You ready? Ready! Ta-da! Oh! Oh, my God! Uh-oh. Yeah, uh-oh! L-Little mistake. You made me look like a zebra! Fix it! Please, fix it. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic, Lin. Fix it! I know I know what I can do. Dye it back! No. Dye it blonde. What? Trust me. Everything is better as a blonde. Everything looks better. Everything tastes better. Like what? Ketchup packets, cough drops Ketchups? Come on. Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, Oh do it, do it, do it. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! What the hell? Can I get a menu, please? Whoa! Oh, my God. Ah! It's middle-aged Mom Barbie! I like your hair. It matches your teeth. Thank you, Tina. Sort of an extreme reaction to a few gray hairs, don't you think? No. I'm not having more fun yet. Wait! Yes, I am! You see? Gene gets it. Bobby, you try. No, I don't think so. Aw, come on! Tina? Um, can I do it later after the chemical smell wears off? Louise? Who said that? Where's Mom? Tina? Trash? No, it's Ginny. From Thundergirls. Ginny? What are you doing in our alley pretending to be the trash? I couldn't risk anyone seeing me. I'm here because Troop 119 has a mole. I thought Katie just had a beauty mark. No, a mole-mole. I think someone in our troop has been spying on us. For our archrivals, Troop 257. Troop 257? They're the toughest troop in town. I heard they hold hot dogs in the fire with their bare hands. Yeah. I saw one of them at the mall, and I hid in the middle of a rack of clothes. But how could there be a mole in Troop 119? We pinky-swore we'd be friends forever. Except that one girl who didn't have a pinky and moved away. She had a lot going on. Tina, I know it sounds crazy, but it's the only explanation. You know how every year our cookie sales are pathetic? Yeah, that's our thing. It's because of the mole. She's been giving away our cookie leads to Troop 257. I wasn't 100% certain until last week I was at my new job. Lot of cookie lovers there. I could smell it. I arranged for Troop 119 to come to my office and sell cookies. It was gonna be a huge score. But when we showed up, guess who beat us to the punch. - Troop 257? - Yes. I had to eat Troop 257's cookies from my own break room. Well, you didn't have to. You I had to, Tina. I had to! I'm so sorry. I've talked to all the girls in the troop, and I can't rule out any of them. The mole could be anybody. Except you, Tina. Oh, good. It can't be you because you left the troop before the humiliating office incident. That's why I need you to rejoin. Talk to the girls. Find the mole. Me? Rejoin? But my wounds are still fresh. I mean, I don't actually have wounds. And if I did, I would do first aid on them because I have that patch. Tina, every year at the cookie jamboree, I've had to explain why we have the lowest sales of anyone. I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not! Now, if I don't find the mole, I'm just I'm gonna I'm gonna dissolve the troop! Huh?! Dissolve Troop 119? No, you can't! Well, I'm gonna do it! Fine, I'll help you find your mole. Great. Okay. Thank you. And remember, don't tell anyone anything about this. Got it. This is between you, me, and my journal. No. No journal. I meant my secret journal. The one you don't know about. You just told me about it. Okay. I'll just write it in a letter and mail it to myself and not open it. No. Don't write it anywhere. Okay. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Cool. We're back in, original copy of the Thundergirls handbook that the other girls think is old and outdated, - like me. High five. - Hey, Tina. We're gonna go find shells and make me a shell bikini. Want to come? Whoa! What's with the Thundergirls uniform? I decided to rejoin the Thundergirls. What? No, Tina. You just got out. Now you're going back in? You're like the Brett Favre of Thundergirls. I couldn't stay away. I mean, it's not for any weird reason. It's not like there's a mole in our troop and I'm going undercover to catch her or anything. Wait, wait, wait. Your troop has a mole? A thunder-mole? What? Where'd you get that idea? Is she giving away your cookie secrets or something? That's my stage name, Cookie Secrets. Actually, yes. To Troop 257. But you didn't hear it from me. Tina, you're the worst person to go undercover to catch a mole. You just spilled your whole story to us. You guys were all over me about it! All right, here's what you got to do. You got to go in there and rattle some cages. Grab those Thundergirls and shake 'em till you shake out a confession! It's me! It's me! I'm the mole! No, Louise. I have to go about this delicately. I have to make the mole feel safe so she comes to me. Ugh, Tina, you so need me on this. Do what I say and say what I say, and we'll have this case cracked by dinnertime. Louise, it's Thundergirls stuff. You wouldn't understand. I can handle this on my own. You don't need to get involved. Tina, please. I'm not gonna get involved. It's not like I'm gonna go out right now and buy a Thundergirls uniform and then show up at your meeting later. I mean, come on. Okay, good. Hey! I was thinking you guys could start calling me Blom. Because I'm blonde and I'm your mom. Get it? Mom, we're busy in here. Hey, don't talk to Blom like that. Thank you, Gene. Okay, Tina. You're back. I mean, you're not back. You're here to find the mole. I mean, maybe sing some songs and make some s'mores. But mostly to find the mole. Hey, good to see the braid trains are still running. Tina, come on in. Look who's back, everyone. Hey, guys. It's your cool, young, hip friend Tina. Can you dig it? You can take my place on the braid train. I have to get snack ready. I hope you all like chips with guaca-mole. Ginny, did you know that the last chip in the bowl is 93% skin cells? Ugh, yes, Jodi. This is nice. Oh, hey, should we play a game where we tell each other our deepest, darkest secrets? Just kidding. I mean, unless you want to. Room for one more on that Thundertrain? Huh? Oh. Hi. Are you Nobody told me I-I don't have any Paperwork? Don't worry about it, honey. My lawyer's sending it over. Meet your newest, greenest, preteenest Thundergirl, me. No! I mean, welcome. Thank you. Louise, I can't believe you joined my Thundergirls troop. I told you I had everything under control. Also, your sash is a disaster. That was driving me crazy. Tina, forget about the stupid sash. We've got a mole to catch, girl! You and I are the mole patrol. Come on! Do it! Beep, beep. No, l Look at my mouth. Let's just get down to business. All right, here's what we know: Troop 119 has a mole who is giving away secrets to Troop 257. Mm. - So, which one of you is sabotaging our cookie sales? - Katie. She's in honors math. - Or she's an evil genius. Ooh. Julie. She's kind of a motor mouth. Is she yapping about troop secrets? Hmm? Rena. She's a little on the short side. But maybe she's telling tall tales. Mm-hmm. Jodi. She wears rubber gloves because she's a major germophobe. Or so she won't leave any fingerprints behind. And finally there's Molly. She's double-jointed. Or a double-crosser. Any one of them could be the mole. Look at this suspicious character. Gene Just let me into your world! Fine. You go through everyone's trash, okay? Dig around. Look for Half-eaten sandwiches? No, clues! They're not mutually exclusive! So we all agree, a surgical mole removal and no one gets hurt. Right, Louise? Yeah, we all agree. But what if I just did this? Ah! Ah! And now we shoot them. Just kidding. I kind of thought that'd be more fun. Let's go trip Dad.  So blonde, so delicate and blonde.  Here are your buns, Mr. Belcher. Why are you calling me Mr. Belcher? - Don't say 'cause I'm your boss - 'Cause you're my boss - And you're my sexy assistant. - And I'm your sexy assistant. Yes. I'm gonna take off all my clothes and wait for you in the walk-in. I don't think that's a good idea to Ow! That hit my eye. Yes, it did. It really hurts. Let me look at it, you big baby. Oh! I'm the blonde nurse! No. No, no. It's World War II. You got shot in the eye. No. The chemistry between us is smoldering. Oh, my God. Let me see it. This The fantasy doesn't work. Why? I-I feel like if I got shot in the eye, I would want you to help my eye. And my brain. Well, I don't know. I'm not a freaking doctor. I'm a nurse, Bob. Well, can you get a doctor? 'Cause I need a doctor. Oh, wait. Uh, I'm a doctor. No. Not Uh, let me look at that over here. Oh, my God. How are your bracelets coming along, girls? Fine. Good. Fine. I'm giving my bracelet to my new baby sister. She's so cute and she has almost no jewelry. I'm giving mine to Katie. I'm giving mine to Julie. Jinx!  Jinx! I mean Okay, time to put the plan into action. Get them to trust me. That's a pretty bracelet, Julie. Thanks! - Okay, phase one complete. - Turn everyone against each other until the mole is flushed out. Wait, what? Katie told me she thinks your bracelet's ugly. Huh? Oh, no. Oh, yes. Okay, I found some pretty cool stuff, and I've organized everyone's trash into piles. Whose trash is that? Jodi's. Hmm. Interesting. It's all interesting. Each pile tells a story. For example, last night, Rena had chicken. The end. Louise! Everyone in Troop 119 hates each other. This is exactly what I was worried about. I believe what you're trying to say is, ""Thank you. Thank you, Louise, for helping me smoke out the mole."" Louise, you're going to destroy the troop! Why do you care so much about the troop, anyway? They rejected you, remember? Troop 119 shaped me into the woman I am. I thought your underwear did that. Tina, we tried things your way. No, we didn't. I did in my head, and it didn't work. You'll thank me later when we remove the mole. Changing subject. Be honest, do I look like a Jessica? This is nice. Wait. Where's Louise? And where's Jodi? Katie, will you watch my lanyard? I'll be right back. Let's mess with her lanyard. I know you know something. Tell me, or the glasses get a swirly! I don't know what you're talking about! And I can't see what you're doing! I'm holding your glasses over the toilet! Louise! Sorry, Jodi. Let me get your glasses back for you. Wait, now what are you doing? Just that thing where I breathe on the lenses and wipe them off with my shirt. I was just about to break her! You're causing too much trouble! At least I'm doing something. While you're making lanyards, whatever those are, I'm the one doing the dirty work. No more dirty work, Louise. I think I think you should leave the troop. Wha What about mole patrol?! I'm shutting it down. Wee-ooh-wee-ooh. That was the sound of the siren shutting down. Okay, fine, I will leave. That's a great idea! Oh, it is? Oh, yeah! So no hard feelings? Nope! All right, everyone, let's make milk carton bird feeders. One last milk carton bird feeder for the road? Good-bye! Bye. See you at home. Which one of you lucky mamajammas wears a size 14 boot and isn't all hung up about having one for each foot? Ugh. Gene, what are you wearing? Trash fashion. I call it trashion. We should probably get you a tetanus shot. Belcher residence. Tina, can you tell Mom and Dad I'll be late for dinner? My meeting's running long. I hope Mom doesn't get too upset. Oh, okay. Wait, what meeting? Oh, just a troop meeting. You know how it goes. Got it. Oh, yeah, yeah. What troop? Troop 257, Tina. You joined Troop 257? No, Louise, you can't do that. They're the enemy troop. Too late. Got to go. Bye-bye! Hello? Louise? Let's get to know our newest member. Troop 2-5-7! Whoo! You guys are the fun-dergirls over here, am I right? Good start, good start. New girl, I didn't catch your name. Alanis. Where'd you say you moved from again? New York, New York. Oh, my cousin Not the one in New York. New York, New York, Michigan. Oh. Hey, so what are we doing, making bracelets? Bracelets? Girls, why don't you do some wood carving today? Okay! What are we whittling? Well, you could whittle a bear or a heart We're whittling knives! You girls and your knives! Hey, guys, sorry I had to stay late at school. We had a bullying lesson. From me. What the hell was that? Our handshake. Love it or lick it, snurb. Hey, I love it already, snurb. No, it's like this. Aah! That's awesome! Do it again! All right. Rock and roll. Oh, girls. How's it going? Any leads yet? I did some research on good places to go on our retreat. I thought we could all spend some time together, talk, create a safe environment. We don't have time to create a safe environment! Ginny, I couldn't help but notice it smells kind of moldy in here. And so I have a couple names of really good mold people Oh! Not now, Jodi! I'll just I'll leave the list over here. I brought you back in here to do a job. My duct tape wallet got stuck in my hair. Well, then cut your hair, Rena! Okay. The cookie deadline is next week. If we don't catch the mole before then, this troop is done! Uh what do I do, what do I do? I'm sorry, Thundergirls, I've let you down. Maybe Louise was right I don't have what it takes. I'm just a washed-up old Thunderhag! Son of a bitch.  La, la, la-la, la, la blonde   La-la, la, la, la, blonde  Lin, you've messed up this order. Blonde? That's the third time today you've got an order wrong, and we've only had three customers. Blonde? Yeah, and I found a bunch of cheese slices in the cash register. Oh. Uh-oh. I think being blonde is making me dumb. Uh, no, it's that you haven't paid attention to anything else but your hair since you dyed it. No, really, I feel kind of dumb. Well, you are kind of dumb. Bob! I'm kidding. I am kidding. You're very smart. Oh, see? - I don't get kidding anymore. - Linda? Who's that brown-haired beauty spinning around in your restaurant? Who's that girl? It's m Whoa! I really am dizzy, I really Oh, boy. Help me up, please. Oh, my God. Gretchen, you're a brunette now? I'm like the Tina Fey of my salon now. Everyone thinks I'm so smart and funny. Really? Yeah. So, how's it going, James Blonde? Ha-ha-ha-ha! Uh, that's one of my jokes. You might not get it 'cause you're blonde. I do get it, Gretchen. I think. Well, I'm off to the library to pick up smart guys. Good-bye, Gretchen. Real quick, Bob, what do you think of the hair? I changed it. I know. Yep. Good-bye, Gretchen! You know what they say once you go brown. Bye! Louise. Tina. Nice sash except for the numbers on it. Nice detective work except for not catching the mole. By the way, I'm heading to a meeting right now. A huge cookie lead just came in. So I guess I got to go solve this thing all by myself. Well, say hi to 257 for me. But don't, because I hate them. I mean, ""hate"" is a strong word, but Okay, while you're finishing that thought, I'm gonna go catch the mole. Thundergirls forever! Thundergirls forever. - We're 2-5-7! - Tell 'em! - What do we do with cookies? - Sell 'em! And what do we do with seat belts? Shut up! Okay, I'll-I'll just drive slow. Fingers in! How'd we find out about this cookie lead? Huh? I'm just curious. I mean, you guys seem to have a lot of leads. We're here! Oh, no. You know this place? This place? Blech! Yeah, I got food poisoning here. Gross! You know what? I can't even go in. I'm gonna, like, throw up. What are you talking about, Alanis? You've got to help carry cookies. Fine. Be right there. Just got to adjust my sash. Aw, it's does anybody's sash just choke you? No. Hi, Thundergirls. Are you the cookie buyer? No yeah no. What? You wanted to buy Uh, no, we didn't. I'll take 'em. Gene, no. Fine, 70. No, not 70. Sign here. Don't sign that. Just sign it. Louise? Why are you dressed like a Thundermummy? Louise? Huh, you must have me confused with someone else. I'm Alanis. What? Louise, what's going on? Why do they think we want cookies? Why do these people keep calling you Louise? These people happen to be her parents. Wait. Where's Tina? What troop is this? These people are her parents? What are they saying?! Well, bye! Hey, look who it is. People that I just don't even know, because I'm not in that troop. Louise! Tina sent us a 911 text to meet her here. What's going on? That's what we'd like to know, Alanis. What are you guys doing here, 257? This is our turf. Are we rumbling, or what? Oh, my God! Hold on, Larissa. Alanis is gonna tell us what's going on. There's a good explanation for everything that I'm gonna tell you when I think of it outside. Oh! Geez! I can explain what's going on. I know who the mole is. You guys are making banana nut fudge cookies with macadamias now?! Tina, what is going on? Why did I dye my hair blonde? I don't understand anything anymore! I said, I know who the mole is. Allow me to explain. In the original edition of the Thundergirls handbook, ""If you want to trap a rabbit, you don't set one trap, you set five."" I gave all of you a fake cookie lead, each one at a different location on Ocean Avenue. Then I staked out Ocean Avenue, knowing that 257 would show up to one of the fake leads. I brought enough food, supplies and toilet paper for days. Luckily, they showed up before I finished my first roll. Gotcha. That's when I texted everyone to come meet me here. Wow! That's impressive. Okay, I am still lost. So, who was it? Let's just say it rhymes with ""Tina."" It's you?! No, it's Rena. Rena! Is that true? I'm not a mole! Tina, how do we know you didn't tell Troop This is your family's restaurant. Uh oh, yeah, good point. Yeah! Hold on a sec. I found  these in Rena's trash! So? Those are my old soccer cleats. Well, they fit me perfectly, and I'm grateful to you! This is ridiculous. Tina's obviously trying to frame me. Tina?! No! No, I'm not. I'm not framing her. Wait, Rena. Rena is the mole! I was right! I knew it! I knew it was you! But you just accused me on the ride over here. Yeah, you accused me, too. I knew it was someone! The only thing I couldn't figure out was why why'd you do it, Rena? My first year as a Thundergirl was in Troop 257 best year of my life. We were in a vicious cookie turf battle with Troop 119. Drastic measures had to be taken. I was selected for a very special assignment to leave the troop I love and pretend to love the troop I hate. We thought you were our friend! All these friendship bracelets, did they mean nothing? You mean this arm garbage? Larissa. Geez. I thought Tina took this Thundergirl stuff seriously. You guys are intense. Yeah. You're like Linda Hamilton when she does all those angry pull-ups. Let's hear it for Tina! Yay! Ugh! Come on. Let's get out of here. Oh, wait! We want to buy your cookies! No! Oh, right, right. No. With these glasses, my garbage  ensemble is complete. It's good. I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I love it. One man's trash is Gene's next outfit. Pick me out something next time you go. What do you like to smell like? Mm, surprise me. Well, another great Thundergirls meeting. Look I got a ""wise owl"" patch for demonstrating the wisdom of an older Thundergirl. Got to hand it to you, T. You earned that patch you caught the mole and saved the troop. I-I know I just said that. So you're sticking with the Thundergirls, huh? I kind of hoped you were done with that extremely long chapter of your life. Aw the mole patrol's gonna miss hanging out with each other. No. I mean, maybe. You were a little jealous of the Thundergirls. Taking your big sister away that's very insightful, Linda. I'm back! Aah! I feel like I could read a book! Louise, you could always come back to Troop 119. Nah. Thundergirls is your bag, and if I had to, I would probably join Troop 257. But if there's a murder or a drug sting, call me. Well, I made this friendship bracelet for you. Eh, you know, I'm not really a jewelry person. - You don't have to wear it. - No, I'm gonna wear it forever. Back off. 2-5-7!"
"Kids, before you go to school, you want to see some art? I've already looked in the mirror once today, so I am good. Is this a trick? We say ""sure"" and then you moon us? No. You know that customer who always doodles on his napkins? Look what he drew yesterday. Oh. It's a fisherman. And he used the grease stain as a lake. That's a good use of grease. You know what, maybe we should put it up over here. Start a wall of customer drawings, right? Huh. A wall of napkin art. That's a good idea, Lin. It is a good idea, Mom. But you know what isn't? Putting your coffee mug so close to the edge of the counter. That's a piping hot cup of ouch. Thank you, Tina. Ugh, we get it. You're a hall monitor. Leave your work at school. Sorry. But all my hall monitoring is gonna pay off. I think Mr. Frond is about to promote me to the highest hall monitor rank there is. It's called Hall Manatee. Hall Manatee? Why is it called that? There are two schools of thought about that. No, never mind. I don't want to hear. Okay. Hi, Ms. Selbo. Signing in for hall monitor duty? You know, there's a rumor going around that you're up for a big promotion. Oh, don't listen to rumors, Ms. Selbo. Then what would I do? Just answer the phone when it rings? Tina, come on. Here's your vest. Good luck, Mana-Tina. What? You didn't hear it from me. Hi, Tina. I-I went ahead and signed you in. That was thoughtful, Rudy, but it's against the rules to forge a signature on the sign-in sheet. Oh, yeah. The rules. I guess I played it pretty fast and loose. Yeah, let's save fast and loose for when you shake your caboose. Rules were made to be followed. Right, sorry. See, that's why you're gonna be a Hall Manatee and I'm stuck at Hall Minnow. Well, I'm also a Hall Minnow 'cause I'm bad at networking. Third period. Lunch is 40 minutes away. Kids are hungry and cranky, which means out in the hallway anything can happen. Got it. Oh, slow you didn't. Huh? I'm saying you weren't going slow in the hall. Slow you didn't? I should have been more clear. Sorry. Full name and grade? Danny Duszynski, fifth. Duszynski. Thank you, Danny. You stupid Whoa. What's that? Bye. Thank you. You're welcome. Whoa, he used language. No, I think he just said ""thank you."" Tina, can I just say it? You inspire me. I know. Hold on. I recognize that sound. It's butts on brass. Huh? Follow me. I love gravity! I'm glad I wore my fast pants! Hey, guys. You just slid into detention. Nice. I'm gonna need a full name and grade from both of you. I get it. Good psych-out, Tina. You scared us straight. Uh, full name and grade. I can't tell you my full name! You know Mom won't tell me my middle name! Geez, Tina, what are you, Narcy Narc and the Narcy Bunch? Fine. Louise and Gene Belcher. All right, off to class. And I'll see you at home. What's Mom making tonight? Anyone know? Good talk. Wow, that was cold-blooded. I guess when you're a hall monitor you have to leave your feelings in your locker. And lose the combination. Yeah Hall monitors on duty, report immediately to Coach Blevins' office. Uh-oh. Let's move. Let me go. Dang. Ugh, Zeke. You called us, Mr. Frond? Ah, Tina. My star hall monitor. And Regular Sized Rudy. My fixer-upper hall monitor. I'll get there. Anyway, I stepped away from class to retrieve my shatterproof Suh-weet. Thanks. When I got to my office, I found Zeke in here digging around. Trespassing in a teacher's office. This is strike three for you, Zeke. I'm afraid that means automatic suspension. Uh, but I got a good reason. Save it. Tina, I need you to escort Zeke to the principal's office. I'd do it myself, but I dropped my cell phone in the toilet, and I need to put it in rice immediately. Has anyone tried that? Does it work? Ha! Mr. Frond's got a smell phone. You're suspended. Tina, think you can handle this? I don't think you can handle how much I can handle this, Mr. Frond. Let's go, Zeke. I'll take it from here, Rudy. You finish your rounds. Are you sure? Zeke's trouble. It's a midday run. I could do it in my sleep. Yeah, but I want to help. I've never transported a perp. Yeah, we're good, Rudy. Oh. Oh, wow. Tina's giving Rudy some 'tude-y. Shut up, Zeke. I'm sorry I said ""shut up."" You shut up. Look what Teddy did! Funky pattern. I'm putting it up! Spirals, right? Welcome to my brain. Look at mine, Linda. Aw, it's a sun wearing sunglasses. Someone's feeling silly. Guilty! Uh, here you go. Here's mine. Ah. Ooh. Yeah. What is it? It's a face. I don't recognize it. Well, it's no one in particular. It's just a face. Hmm. Could it be a foot? Oh, I see it now! It's a beautiful face. So are you gonna put it on the wall? What? Yeah. S-Sure. Yeah, of cour I'm gonna put it up. Wall. Well, it doesn't seem like you want to. Oh, here's a spot for it. Right there. Uh. Wait. Y Lin, you're putting it behind the coffee machine. Am I? Forget it. If I-I don't want you to put it up if you don't like it. Okay. That was close. We were gonna have to look at that thing every time they moved the coffee pot. Sorry, Teddy. Sorry it's not a spiral or a sun with sunglasses. Speaking of spirals Whoa! Right? Oh, I'm dizzy! Another one's going up! Oh, my God. Put it put it right there. Come on! The time doesn't fit the crime. You got to let me go! Enough, Zeke. You're the one who broke into the gym teacher's office. Okay, listen, I did it for my grandma. Sure you did. Well, can I at least use the bathroom before you turn me in? I don't think so. Please! Have a heart, Tina! Good gosh. Okay. But make it quick. All right! Thanks, T-Bird! Okay. Zeke? Zeke, as your hall monitor, I'm ordering you: Come out with your hands washed. That's odd. Anybody in here? I'm coming in on 90% official hall monitor business. And 10% curiosity. Zeke? Answer me, Zeke. I know you're in there. I can see your shoes. Huh. Where'd your legs go? What the Oh, no. I lost Zeke. - Aah! Tina. -  Mr. Frond. How'd it go? Did Zeke give you any trouble? Well, uh Of course he did. But I'm sure you handled it, right? Tina? Tina? God, that sound makes me queasy, Tina. It went great. I dropped him off at the principal, and the principal said, ""Thank you, Tina."" Everything was fine. Terrific. That's why you're the best. Stop it! Tina. Liar. Zeke. Zeke. Come out. Everyone's wrestling out here. I'm being wrestled. Oh, hey, Tina. Ah! Sorry to interrupt. Everything okay with Zeke? Everything's fine. What a weird thing to bring up. Come on. It's Regular Sized Rudy. You can talk regular to me. Everything is great, Rudy! It's really, really, really, really great! Okay, but it just seem Got to go. Everything's great. See you soon. I can't believe it. My hero's gone dirty. Stand down, feelings. Stand down. Time for Rudy to clean up this mess. It's almost lunchtime. Once these halls fill up with people, I'll never find Zeke. I should call for backup. Why'd you pull us out of class? Yeah, I was learning stuff! You guys, I need your help. Oh, do you? You busted us today like we were just a couple of butt-sliding strangers! Yeah! We all slid out of the same place, sister! It was nothing personal. Well, then nothing personal, but if you want our help, it's gonna cost you big-time! Yeah! Ok-Okay, um, I-I can give you each a hall pass. Is that all? Then we will pass on that offer. Wait! What if I could give you A permanent hall pass? A perma-pass? Is that real? Could it be? One hall pass to rule them all. It exists, but only for kids with serious medical conditions. Lucky! So we help you get promoted And these halls are yours. All right. You got our attention. What's the job? I lost Zeke. I was supposed to get him to the office, but he got away. I need you to help me get him back. Is that all? Think, Tina. How do you find someone who doesn't want to be found? You rough up that someone's friend. Jimmy Jr.? Oh, I don't think we need to ask him anything about this. Want to get Zeke? Then suck it up, T. J-Ju! Buddy! What's going on, man? What do you want, Louise? What do I want? I want to chat. Watch for lunch ladies and Feds. All right, where is he? Where is who? Your buddy Zeke. He's hiding somewhere in school. I-I don't know anything about it. Oh, no? Tell me something. You're a dancer. How important is it for a dancer to have toes?! Uh, that didn't hurt, Louise. Why not?! That was my whole body! I'm wearing thick socks? Okay. Take your socks off. No. Where's Zeke, Jimmy Jr.?! Whoa. Yikes. I told your sister, Tina, I don't know. That's not good enough. Ew, Tina, this tray is gross! Too bad you chose chowder day to lie to me. It's chowder day? Okay! I don't know for sure, but there's a place Zeke goes sometimes. He calls it his hidey-hole. Where is it? Stop it, Tina! The storage room! Over by the science lab! Now take off your socks! Yeah, take off your socks! Okay! Oh, wait. Um, don't take off your socks. Put them back on. Sorry. Yeah, it wouldn't make much sense. Wait, so put 'em back on or - Put it back on! - Okay! Faster! Faster! It's not going on! Put them on! Now! They're all sweaty! Okay. A little shading over here. Looks good. Uh, Lin, take a look. I did another one. Mmm. Hmm. I went back to the drawing board. Literally. And I and I drew something I know I could never mess up a burger. Yeah. It's good. Oh, my God. You are so bad at pretending you like it. What are you talking about? It's so good I want to eat it. Look, I just ate it. Okay, let's put it up. We'll put it up. No, Lin, I-I don't want a sympathy hang. Do you like it or not? Mike the Mailman! Get in here! Talk to us! Please. You know what, don't use Mike as an excuse to change the subject, Lin. What was the subject? Your marriage? What? Oh, doodle wall, huh? Yeah! What do you think, huh? Artsy. May I? Boom. 3-D cube. Oh, my God, it's perfect! Mmm. That's good. Yeah. Oh, it's jumping out at me! Oh. Oh, it's going on the wall. You know what the trick is? Draw a square, draw another square, connect 'em. See, you never know. People could be a mailman but they're also an artist. Why is everybody good at this but me?! Okay, someone's jealous. I love it, Mike. Whoa. This is a good hidey-hole. What this room really needs is a desk. Zeke? You in here? You go low, we'll go high. Look! You see him? No, it's a box of chalk nubs! Nub party! Zeke, I can hear you. There! There he is! Uh-oh. Get out, Tina! You have nowhere left to crawl. I told you, I'm innocent! I don't care. All right, only one thing left to do. Jump to freedom! I'm coming, Grandma! You still have nowhere left to crawl. What is this? Chinese finger trap. I got it as a party favor. But in America. All right. Is there a trick to it? Don't tell me. Okay, tell me. No. Got your man, Tina. And I'm eating this chalk. We all did good. I'll take it from here, guys. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. What about our perma-passes? Those exist? Dang! I heard they tattoo 'em on your neck and it hurts, but it's worth it. No, but they're laminated. Here. If anyone asks, you have irritable bowel syndrome. All bowels are irritable. Hey, ticket to ride. I'm Louise. Let's roll. Let's go everywhere in the world except class. It's almost like the harder I pull, the tighter it gets. Aha! Found you! Rudy! You lied to Mr. Frond! You said you delivered Zeke. I am delivering him. Now. Back off, Rudy. You were my hero. Now look at you! Dang! Zeke's coming with me. Easy, squirt. Detach him, Tina. I'm bringing Zeke in, and I'm reporting you to Mr. Frond. You blew it, man. No! I worked too hard for this promotion. Hand over the Zeke! Lunch is over. Hey, look, uh, a kid, uh, doing something dangerous and breaking a rule. Oh, rules are Oh. Hey, come back! What are you doing! The principal's office is the other way. There's more than one way to the principal's office. There are two ways. Here we go. This guy. What?! Hi. Uh, so, um, I need a quick drawing lesson. Oh, you must mean the Emergency Drawing Package. Yes. D-Do you have that? No! 'Cause there's no such thing! Takes years of training to be an artist. Years! Look, you're the only real artists I know. You're very talented. Well, actually, Harold's not that good. I'm-I'm fair. You're not, honey. I am! You know you aren't. Okay. Look, I would really appreciate it if you'd help me I'd be honored. All right. Stop groveling! We'll give you a crash course. Really? Thank you. I'll set up the studio. Harold, sell him the supplies. All right. $30! For a pencil and a pad of paper? You want to learn to draw?! Pay the man! All right, all right, all right. Come on, we just need to get around to the front of the school. Can I ask you something? Why do you want to be a hall monitor, anyway? It's just telling on kids. It's not telling on kids. It's helping on kids. Well, you aren't helping on me. It's your own fault. You've committed a series of Mr. Wieners. That's what I call misdemeanors. Cool. Funny words make the job fun. Yeah. Listen, this is the truth. I broke into Coach's office so I could take the mascot uniform. The Wagstaff Whaler? Why? I told you for my grandma. She's having surgery today, and I just wanted to mascot around for her before she went under the knife. You expect me to believe that? Yeah. Grandma likes mascots. She met my grandpa when they were mascottin' in college. They looked into each other's big dumb foam eyes, and that was it. Miss Labonz! If she sees us, we'll be in big trouble. What are you two kids doing outside? Uh What are you doing, Miss L? Smoking. Cool. Smoking is not cool, Zeke. Yes, it is. N-No, it's not. Especially when teachers do it. That's cool! It's like you're teaching me to smoke. I love this stuff! Don't Stop saying that, Zeke. We're like best friends, man. No, we're not. No. We're bonding over cigarettes. That's pretty cool. We are not bonding over cigarettes! Sure we are. Hey, hey, let me get one of those! I've been dying to try one of them. You two get to class! Come on, throw one in my mouth. I'll see if I can catch it. Stop. Stop talking to me. Took care of that. Adults get really nervous when you ask them for cigarettes. Quick thinking. Thanks. That's how you help a kid. Not by being a narc. Whoa. Okay, what's happening, exactly? Life drawing. If you can draw a nude figure, you can draw anything. Grab your charcoal, Charlie! Lady's a-waitin'. Okay, um, wha-what do I draw first? The gesture, and then the essence, and then the breasts. I don't see you drawing! Sorry, I can't look up. Harold, be my eyes how's he doing? Bad. Listen, I'm trying. I just can't breathe right now. Oh, you don't like what you see, huh? Oh, it's good. No, it's fine. Get used to it it's the human form. It's the most beautiful thing you're ever gonna see in your life. It's super yummy. Tell him! I just wasn't expecting the hair. If you don't let me go, I'm gonna chew my finger off! Zeke! Come on! Grandma's gonna have to leave for the hospital soon! Even if what you were saying was true, you still should have asked for the mascot suit. I did. I asked Coach B if I could borrow the suit fair and square, but he wouldn't let me. Probably thought I was gonna poop in it. Just 'cause I used to poop in stuff. Give it up, Zeke. Almost there. Oh, Rudy. Tina, you leave me no choice. Mr. Frond! No! Zeke? You should be in the principal's office. He was um, 'cause I took him, obviously. She never took him. She never took him. Tina, is this true? Yes. How's your cell phone doing? It's dead. Oh, I heard that rice thing, that that's supposed to I'm very disappointed in you, Tina. Clearly you couldn't handle this responsibility. Now, un-trap your fingers. You say that like it's easy. Oh! Let's do it again! Hi, Ms. Selbo. Hi, Tina. I heard a rumor that you were disgraced. What? Wagstaff front desk. You're calling from where, ma'am? The Elegant Doily Retirement Home? Oh, that's right down the street. Sometimes your wanderers come here. Well, I don't know if your grandson is still coming to visit who is he? Oh, Zeke. I'll see if I can find him for you. Zeke was telling the truth. Perma-pass! We can do anything we want within limits! Hey, uh, guys, listen, I owe you both an apology. Yeah. My ambition got the best of me. Uh-huh. I've let it turn me into a bad hall monitor and an even worse sister. Yes, you did. I'm sorry. We forgive you. Gene! Leave her hanging for a second. Shove your apology! Yeah! That's fair. Okay, okay. We forgive you. Ah, thank you. And there's one more thing. We need to help Zeke. Tina, I hate to tell you this, but that's not Zeke. Okay, Zeke is in the principal's office being watched by Ms. Schnur and Mr. Frond. The principal naps in his car every day until 1:45. That gives us seven minutes to spring Zeke. How are we gonna get past Mr. Frond? Forget Frond it's Ms. Schnur you've got to worry about. She's short, but she's got a seven-foot wingspan. It's okay. I have an idea. I told you, my grandma's about to go under Oh, spare me the grandma stuff. Grandma excuses are older than grandmas themselves. Hey, Penny Marshall's outside! The Penny Marshall?! Yeah. And she said something about needing a new best friend. That could be me! Ms. Schnur, Penny Marshall is not outside. Mr. Frond, if she is out there and I don't go out, I will never forgive myself! Out of my way! Ms. Schnur, no! Zeke, run! Come here, get up. Uh, counsel me. No, counsel me. Not now. Counsel me! Counsel me! I'm messed up! I'm a big mess! Zeke. What's going on? Take it. What? And go. Damn, Tina. Now I got a story to tell on our wedding day. You think that's not gonna happen, but I'll get you, girl. I'm gonna get you. Okay, d-don't say anything, just go. Zeke, come back here! Let him go, Mr. Frond. He's going to see his grandma before she has surgery. His grandma? You naive little wide-eyed candy-dandy fool. This is Zeke we're talking about. Once, he faked lice. I think he used Sea-Monkeys. But I was in Ms. Selbo's office when his grandma called. Anyone can get a friend to pretend to be someone's grandma. There are services that do that. Mr. Frond, we're hall monitors. But people aren't halls. Tell that to Darryl Hall. And Anthony Michael Hall. Arsenio Hall. Okay, a lot of people are Halls. But what I'm saying is people are complicated. Life is complicated. And sometimes even liars tell the truth. I believe Zeke. You do, huh? Okay, I'll bet you he's lying. If I'm wrong, you're not in trouble. And, what the heck, I'll give you your promotion. Forget the promotion. If you're wrong, Zeke's not suspended. Sure, I'll even throw in some ice cream for Zeke's imaginary granny after her imaginary surgery. And you have to marry her for citizenship. What happens if Tina loses? One month's detention. And you turn in your vest. And your finger trap. But that's mine. If I win, I want it. Cool bet, Tina. But Zeke does this kind of thing a lot. And that's coming from a girl who does this kind of thing a lot. Yeah, think about it, T. You're on, Frond. Terrific. To the nursing home! We're coming, too. - Yeah! - Great! Come along. W-wait, where's everybody going? We're going on a ""splash of cold hard truth in Tina's face"" field trip! I didn't get a slip for that. Okay, here we are. Zeke's grandma? Is Zeke's grandma here? Yes. Yep, that is definitely Zeke's grandma. Huh? Oh, that's strange. There's Zeke's grandma, but I don't see Zeke anywhere. Maybe that's because Liars are liars, and people are bad. Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, I am right! Are you my surgeon? I can't believe Zeke's not here. Sorry, Tina. I was kind of hoping he would be here, too. Y'all ready for this?! No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You lose, Frond. You lose! Whalers in the front! Let me hear you grunt! That's my boy. Ice cream time! There's an ice cream truck around here somewhere, Mr. Frond. Better go find it. Okay, okay, okay, I'm going. Walk, don't run. Nice! There you are. Where were you? Did you go to the store or something? I did, in a way. And what I bought was a new me. A me who can draw! Look at this, Lin. It's naked Edith! It's good. Kids, look it's naked Edith. Naked Edith! Naked Edith! Saggy and sophisticated. Just like it says on her bumper sticker. Mm-hmm. Oh, oh, look what I'm doing. Right now. Look, look where it's going. Really? Yep. I made the wall. You made the wall sexy. Look at all those nooks and crannies. Yeah, lotta-lotta folds. Whalers in the front! Let me hear you grunt! Whalers in the front! Let me hear you grunt!"
"Mom and Dad might not recognize us when we get back from go-karting. 'Cause our hair will be like this. And our faces will be like this! And our penises will be like this. You can't see what I'm doing, but it's pretty great. Three youth tickets, please. Sorry, track's closed for the rest of the day. League racing. What?! What? But I pedaled all this way to put the pedal to the metal. You'll have to come back another time. Perhaps check the online calendar that I work so hard on that no one bothers to look at. If I'm online, I'm looking at sloths. Whoa, Mama like. They're fast, and I'm curious. Screw regular go-karting. I want to do that. Every kid wants to be in league racing. Get in line. Okay, where's the line? Funny, honey. The only way to join the circuit is to get a kart. No problem. Where do we get one? They're custom. They cost a grand, at least. Ah! I know you from somewhere. You're Bryce from Kingshead Island, aren't you? Yep. Oh, yeah. Remember us? Nope. Ouch. Too bad you won't be joining the league. It would've been fun chucking raisins at you as I blow by. - Geesh-geesh, goosh-goosh. - Ow. Ow. Oh, my God, I hate him. Hard to hate a guy who gives you raisins. Three burgers of the day. Who are your pals, Teddy? These guys are from the home brew supply shop. I brought 'em over here to try your burgers with Teddy's Brewski. What's Teddy's Brewski? It's the name of my home-brewed beer. I used to call it Bucket Brew, since that's where it ferments. In a bucket. Is it safe to drink? You know, it's just that you brewed it in a bucket. Of course it's safe. It's alcohol. Mmm Mmm Right? Mm-hmm. Oh. Mmm. Aw, so cute. Your burgers and his beer are making little belly babies. Ew. What? Oh, Bob. Bob! Bob! What what? What? You should sell my beer! We could be partners! What? Teddy, I-I don't think restaurants are allowed to sell home-brewed beer. Aw, who's gonna care? The health inspector, the Bureau of Alcohol, the police So we won't get caught. We'll run it like a speakeasy. I'll be like Al Capone with breasts. Come on, Bob, just taste your burger and then my beer. Well, it's pretty hard to pair my burgers with the right beer. Oh, my God. Right? Huh? Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let's do it! It's amazing! - Let's do it! - Yes! Maybe Mom and Dad would sponsor a go-kart if it was advertising for the restaurant. They can't even sponsor their electric bill. Or maybe a sponsorship would work. Hey, Mr. Fischoeder! I missed you. Damn. Where have you been? Oh, around. How would you like to have semi-exclusive advertising rights on a go-kart that you pay for? Me pay kids? That sounds weird. How 'bout you pay me that sounds better No. Um Huh. Hold on. I haven't finished. For one of these! A broken-down bumper car? Perhaps you kids can turn one of these not go-karts into a very much go-kart. Someone's sleeping back here, Mr. Fish. That's our employee lounge. Owen, wake up! Hmm. You look like you've got something to prove. Guys, I think this is the one. Ooh, that's the most expensive one. We'll give you three bucks for it. Deal. Unless you want to make it eight dollars for a second bumper car, plus Owen, whom I will throw in for free. What can he do? Lord knows. It all remains to be seen. He's a mass of potential. Now all we need is a lawn mower engine. Or a steam engine. Or a motorcycle engine. So how much is it gonna cost us, Critter? Aw, come on, I can't charge you guys. Our kid was born inside your restaurant. Plus, I think the parts will be donated, if you catch my drift. Come on, people, let's tear this old dog apart, teach it new tricks!   Half bumper car, half go-kart, all balls. Nice. You're gonna bump those rich kids right off the track. And how are we on snack storage? Chip clip right there on the side. Chip clip! Yeah. Now, she's gonna handle like a bumper car. The steering's real loose, so don't be afraid to whip that wheel around real good. Yeah, yeah. You push the pedal and the thing goes. Wait till Bryce gets a load of this sweet ride. What is that? Are you jealous? It doesn't sound like you are, but you will be once we race against you. You're not gonna race against me. What are you talking about? I'm in A-league. New cars start out in B-league. You got to win your way up to A-league. Are you kidding me? Nope. I'm serious-ing you. I'll be winning the Kingshead Island Grand Prix when you're still figuring out which pedal is the gas and which is the brake. And the big round thing in the middle that steers it? That's your mom. Burn. Oh, that fart with a mouth? That's your face! Yeah, right. Drivers, ten minutes till the B-league race. I guess that's us. Let's go tear up the B-league so we can blow it out Bryce's tailpipe. Here we go. Wish me luck out there. Hmm? Wait, what do you mean wish you luck? 'Cause I'm driving. I thought I was driving. I thought we all thought I was driving. Oh, my God. Did we not talk about who's gonna drive? It's obviously me. But remember how good I was at that motorcycle arcade game? The point is to not burst into flames. Strongly disagree. Tina, you're not much better. Remember what happened when you drove the car in the parking lot? That was different. That was dirty driving. This is legal. Go-karting is good clean fun. There's only one way to settle this. Gene's hairy mole? Gene's hairy mole. Oh, boy. Ow. Ow. Ow! Hold 'em up. Yes! Uh, I mean Whatever. I'm the driver. But, hey, it's all about the team. Right, sibs? Fair is fair, I guess. Go team. Yeah, Tina! That's the spirit! And you know what, I want you to be my water girl out there. How does that sound? Water girl instead of race kart driver? Hmm, let me think about that. Hey, when I win this race, it'll be like we all won. Especially me. T, give me a squirt. You missed. Did you do that on purpose? No. What a crazy water bottle. Oh, whoops. - Uh, it's doing it again. - Oh, sorry.  Hey! This is this is crazy. Drivers, start your engines. That guy can make a flag do anything he wants. But mostly flap around. Come on, you hunk of junk! Go straight! Now turn! Turn! You call that turning? The other way! Pretty good, kid. But can you Gus? Whoa. It's beautiful! Why is it called Gus? It's named after me. My name is Gus. A lot of people think the Gus comes from the wrists. It doesn't. It comes from in here. Your flask? Yes. And the heart. Without heart, you're just waving a flag around at the end of a little stick. Hey, maybe you've got what it takes to be a junior-Gus-in-training. I've waited my entire life to hear those exact words! That bumper-kart is terrible. We'll never win a race in that thing. Well, we might if, you know, you drove it like Critter told us to. What's that supposed to mean? Maybe it's not the kart's fault you slammed into all those walls and got turned around and drove the wrong way for an embarrassing amount of time. You think you can drive that thing?  Be my guest. Take a lap. We're gonna go nice and easy. You lead, I'll follow. I know you want to bump into stuff but you can't. You're a race car now. You're all grown-up. That's it, Mr. Speedy. See? See what? How I took that turn instead of crashing like you did? Maybe I should be the one behind the wheel for Team Belcher? Tina, hello, it was my first race, okay? Back off. Besides, I won Gene's hairy mole fair and square. So let's speak of this no more. It's just, I could maybe win Gene's hairy mole! I know. Gene's hairy mole. - How's it coming? - Great. Once I'm done here, I'm gonna bring up another batch from the basement. Home brew in used bottles; I think we're getting good at this speakeasy thing. And all these sipsies are getting me tipsy. Eh, I had to hammer some of the caps back on and I used tape for a couple of 'em, but I don't think anyone will notice. Uh, another ""beer,"" please? Wink. Another one of the beers we normally sell here? Sure. Here you go. Whoa! Live one! Is he supposed to say ""wink""? Or is he just supposed to wink? Well, we've been doing both. Oh Oh, God. Oh, God! Bobby, the G-men are here! Turn the whole room around like they do in the movies! Quick, go! Ugh, no, no. Not now. Teddy, get out of here! Hurry. Hurry. Hugo! Bob. Ron. Bob. Ron! Oh. What's wrong with this picture, Ron? Uh There are actually customers in here! Right. Smells yeasty. I've never smelled this tangy sour yeast here before. Oh, uh, well, we have started baking bread, so maybe you're smelling the yeast from that. Yeah. And where is this yeasty bread, Bob? Uh, we, uh we threw it away. It wasn't any good. No. Yeah. Terrible, terrible. It didn't come out, so I mean, it was our first batch. You know? W-We're not Who are we? You know? We're not bread experts. Bread. Hugo, you really don't have to go down there! So yeasty. Okay, you need to stop saying that word. It's making me uncomfortable. Oh, really? Yeasty, yeasty, yeasty. You know what I think, Bob? I think the bread story is a cover for what you're really doing. And what would that be? You're brewing your own beer! What?! That's crazy. What? It's crazy. Where would you get that? Beer. Who's brewing beer? What are What is what is this? What? Who is this guy? Beer. Pfft. You know, the only thing worse than an idiot who makes bacteria-infested home brew is a restaurant that serves it. Well, Hugo, there's no home brew here, so are we done with the inspection? I suppose. But know this, Bob, if I find out you are selling bacteria beer, you're going to get the triple smack-down. Smack one: I shut you down. Smack two: beer and wine license? Gone. Smack three? Tell 'em, Ron. Uh You rot in hell, Bob! Hmm. Let's go, Ron. And I'll be back to try that bread, Bob. Great. 'Cause it's gonna be here, Hugo. Oh, great! I'll bring my bread mouth! So I guess this means the speakeasy's over? Nothing's over, Teddy. Hugo can't stop us. All right, who knows how to bake bread? Flutter, flutter, flutter. Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy. And snap it off! Hell of a snap-off, Gene. Yeah, but my shimmy was shabby. I saw you drive that monstrosity the other day. It was impressive. Want to take a little walk and talk? I have a proposition for you. I'm taken. Well, it's complicated. Honey, if I was hitting on you, you'd know, because you'd be terrified. Trust me, you're hitting on me. Just come with us, please. My name is Sasha, and this is my racing team. Hi. Hi. So how'd you like to be a driver? Oh, I can't. My sister is our team's driver. She won the right to drive fair and square. Gene's hairy mole. It's this thing we do with Oh, it's okay. I don't need to know. Listen, I'm not talking about you driving that thing. - I'm talking about this. - Whoa. Eddy, our usual driver, is in detention again. You'd be doing us a big favor if you drove the K.I.S. kart today. ""Kiss""? No, K.I.S. It stands for Kingshead Island Speeders. Can I call it ""kiss""? No. Listen to me. This is your chance to drive a real race kart, in the A-league. But I thought you had to win your way into the A-league. It's about the kart. This kart is already in the A-league. But why don't you want to drive the car yourself? Any kid can drive. I want to win. You think I can win? In A-league? If you can get that bumper-fart around the track in 70 seconds, imagine how fast you can go in this. Wow. You and this thing might actually have what it takes to knock Bryce off the top spot. He deserves to be beaten, by the way. He's a dirty driver. We call him Not Nice Bryce. I don't know. The bumper-kart is kind of a family project. Oh, sure, of course, yeah. You can just keep squirting water into your sister's mouth if you want. Here, I made you this last-place medal. It's gum. Good one, Bryce. Joke's on you. I love old gum! Mmm. It's okay. He walked away. Tina, what are you wearing? A driver's jumpsuit. We've been through this, okay? Belcher Racing only has one driver, and that's me. I know. I'm driving for the Kingshead Island Speeders. What?! I call it ""kiss."" You're abandoning Team Belcher?! How can you do that to us?! You're like a Belcherdict-Arnold! I was Team Belcher's best driver, but you didn't care if we won as long as you got to be the driver. That's crazy. You're crazy. Get out of that jumpsuit, get your water bottle and get back in the pit. I'm never going back to the pit unless the pit is a cool diner where teens hang out. Look, the A-league race is about to start. I got to go. You're in A-league?! Yeah, it's pretty cool. They give your go-kart a little wreath if you win. Oh, wow! Isn't that great? It is pretty great. Bye! - Hi, Tina. How are you doing? - Good. 'Cause you're looking a little stiff out there, kiddo. Who's saying this? Sasha. I'm on the radio inside your helmet. Oh, 'cause I thought for a second you were Oh, never mind. I'm not gonna tell you what I thought. Tina, you're driving like a water girl. Come on, cut it loose. All right, all right, I just need to get to know the car a little, I guess. Hello. You feel different than the bumper-kart. But I must feel different than your old driver, 'cause I have a girl butt, or so I'm told. I'm Tina, by the way. Tina, I'm gonna put you on mute. Okay. Whoa. You did that really well. Nice turning, wheels. And good job, steering wheel, too. And, uh, engine, you did your part. Second place! I knew it! I knew you were a racer! I got a little worried when you were talking to yourself and being really weird, but then you came through! It's okay! This time second, next time beat Bryce. Tina, can you pass me a napkin? And try not to betray it. Louise, please pass the pepper. And try not to crash it into the salt. Why don't you try to remember where that pepper came from? From here, from this apartment, from this family. So that's where pepper comes from. Girls, you two need to stop all this. You're both go-kart drivers now. And you're not even racing against each other, right? That's right. I'm in the A-league. Well, I'm coming for you, T. If I finish the season in first place in the B-league, then I get a spot in the Kingshead Island Grand Prix. You do? Yup. And that's when I get to beat you. But you have to actually win races to finish in first place. Maybe you didn't totally understand that. Oh, keep it up. Way ahead of you. Literally. Look, I know there's this rumor that Tina's a better driver, and I think you started it, but you and me are gonna work real hard, and we're gonna win some races.   Ha, ha! Looks like I'll be seeing you at the Grand Prix, sis. And I'll be seeing you from the first place podium. Also, I'll see you at home, and also in the car, 'cause we should probably carpool to the race. Yup, yup, got it! I hit the gas, and I drive away! It's weird how you freshly baked the staleness right into them. It's-it's an old family secret. Another cold one, Bob. Hey, Bob, that bun doesn't look like this bun, Bob. You trying to screw me? I want the fresh-baked buns. I want the fresh-baked buns. So, you're not using these buns on your burgers? Suspicious. Gretchen? Move on. We're-we're making buns for, uh, um, uh For what? Uh, the buns are for For breakfast! Yes. We're gonna start breakfast now. Hmm. Breakfast at Bob's. I can't wait to come by and try it. I mean, well, we haven't really talked about when we're opening yet, so Okay, see you at 6:00 then. And you better have sausages, Bob! We'll have it! So, this is what the kids have been up to? I had no idea it was, like, you know, actual racing. It is a beautiful day for racing. Hey, want a hit? Sure. Thanks, Crit. Mmm, this homebrew of yours is oh so refreshing. Your bread is, uh Whoop, hey, there it goes! Got away from me there. Sorry about that. Uh, you-you kind of threw it. Oh, yeah. Right. So it didn't get away from you. You threw it. No, it's bad. I was trying to spare your feelings, but if you want to address it, it's not very good bread. No, I get it. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess I got it right away. I just thought forget it. Yeah. Unnecessary little confrontation here. Gene, you've been oddly enthusiastic about flag waving these last couple weeks. I thought you were just messing with me, but you were serious. Very serious. Then, well, there's something I want to ask you. Oh, my God, you're dying! I'll take over for you! What? No, I'm not dying. For now. I'm not dying. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay. I was gonna ask you if you wanted to flap your first grand prix. I would be honored! I'll wave your flag, Gus, but I'll never replace you. Right, I-I know. Just to clarify, it's only one race. We'll see. Guys, huddle up. Cookie toast. Tina, bring it home for us. Uh, hey, Rico, these cookies are ten dollars each. You're eating them like they're five dollars each. Sorry. Can I have a cookie? I'll put a cookie on the finish line. But what if someone drives over it? That someone will be you. Then I can't eat it. Ugh. Great. Bryce. You here, me no like. Pasta salad on your kart. Ugh! Don't you put pasta salad on my kart! Drivers, two minutes to the start of the Grand Prix! I'm gonna beat you! I'm gonna beat Tina! I'm gonna beat all you Richie Riches! Not likely, especially because of that. Aw, crap. Flick, flick. No, no, no! It's a blown pump. I don't have my tools, but maybe I can rig something. - Drivers, to the starting line! - I don't know if we're gonna make it! We'll make it! We'll make it! What's going on? It looks like you have one less competitor to beat. But I don't want to beat her this way. Today, you beat her this way. Tomorrow, you beat her that way. All that matters is today you beat her this way. Drivers, start your engines! There! Now you're gonna leak some oil, but you just might make it around! Thanks, Critter. Oh, and a wheel mighfall off. What? What?! Nothing! Get out of your head! Did you fix it or not, Critter?! Let's say I did. Go, go, go! Come on, bumper-kart! Hold it together! You got this! How you doing out there? Well, I'm torn between the desire to win and my love for my sister. Forget it. Bye. Bye. Atta girl. Let's beat these snobs! Yeah! Uh-huh!  Every day  All right! Gene, it's white flag time. Last lap coming up! It's now or never, Tina. Make your move! Pass him! Aah! Oh, come on! Hey! That's not nice, Bryce! Oh, I get it now. Aah! That's it! What?! So long, Bryce. I kartly knew you. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go! Come on, Bryce, get it together. That's Tina and Louise out in front. Come on, girls! Win this thing! Oh, my God. I assumed they'd both lose. What if one of them wins and beats the other? Dibs on not handling it! Checkered flag time! They're coming in! Gene, do the double! I'm not ready! Easy, easy. Deep breath. Let it flow from within you. Here they come! Son of a bitch! Yes! The Grand Prix is ours! Go Team K.I.S. No, go Team Belcher. Excuse me? What are you talking about? Are you crazy? You're helping another team win?! Sorry, Sasha. It's a family thing. He's Gussin'! What are you doing?! Helping you win! You should win! You're the better driver. You should win. You worked really hard to get here. I guess, but Oh, I just won. Nice flag-waving, Gene! I did it! I did it! I waved that flag! Yay, kids! Yes! Yes, kids! Yeah, that's the way to do it! Belchers! Belchers! Belchers No one? No one. Are you done yet, Hugo? Look, Bob, we both know you're slinging homebrew. And if my supervisor wasn't saying, ""I'm going to fire you if you waste any more time on that case,"" I'd nail you for it. That said the sausages are good. - Let's go, Ron! - Hey, can I get a box for my pancake half? Just stuff it into your mouth! It's half a bite! We got to stop. We can't keep this up. Oh, thank God. I'm so bloated and tired. Somebody's gonna have to tell Teddy. Dibs on not telling him! Dibs on not Damn it! How do you talk so fast? Vroom. Oh, good turn. Vroom. Tina? Tina? You're-you're driving in your sleep again. Oh, sorry. Yeah. I know it's like we both won, but maybe we both don't need to sleep with the trophy, huh? Okay, one more night. Okay, one more week. Sweet dreams.  Racing with the road   Racing with the road   Racing with the road   Racing with the road   Race   Fast   Race   Fast   Race   Fast   Race   Fast   Race"
"Niagara ketchup! I don't get it. Oh, like Niagara Falls, but with ketchup? No! Oh, yes. Kids, stop. You love Niagara ketchup! Admit it! You want to get in a barrel and be part of it! BOB: No. Dad, are you still mad about the zester? Yes, of course I'm mad. You zested gum off Gene's shoe. Yeah. It's called being a good sister. But now it's ruined. You can never un-zest this. Can't we get another zester? Not like this one. It was perfect. I had more zest for this zester than I do for life. It was simply the zest. Ha, ha! Too soon. Yeah. Hey, Mike. You got some bills, and this one feels really weird if you squeeze it. Oh, my God! A letter from the community garden! Please let it say I'm accepted. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it! âDear Mr. Belcher, we regret to inform youâ Damn it! Aw! Oh, they sent a packet of seeds. Consolation seeds. I've been there. Why would they send those? I don't know, Tina. I guess to remind me of the beautiful place that exists that I'll never get to be a part of! Like the boys locker room. Or New York in the '90s! Cheer up, Bobby. We could get you a little planter box to hang from the window. It's not the same, Lin. It's not just about growing a few things. It's about working the land, growing produce for the restaurant. If we had a yard, I'd do it there, but we don't. Get off your high horse. Why don't you grow some alley pumpkins? I want land! I'm a gardener trapped in the body of an urban restaurateur. I have ground beef under my fingernails, but it should be ground beef and dirt! Ugh. Mike, I know you're just the mailman, but I can't help thinking you did this. Sure, blame me for this, but you never thank me for the letters I don't deliver. Thank you. Bye-bye. There must be something I can do to get in. You know what? I'm gonna walk down there and talk to the garden master. Oh, Cynthia? Good luck with that piece of work. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cynthia as in Logan's mom? As in Logan, my archenemy?! Yeah. Tell her to tell Logan he's a (blows raspberry). And his head looks like (blows raspberry). And his face sounds like (blows raspberry). He'll know what it means. I, uh I probably won't do that, Louise. Do you want me to write it down then? Um, yeah, go ahead. You know, do what you got to do, Bobby. If you have to sleep with her to get in, it's okay. I don't like her, but whatever it takes. BOB: Way ahead of you, Lin. (birds chirping) It's so perfect. Can I help you? Oh. Hi, Cynthia. (sighs): Oh. So, um, uh, it's been a while since we were all in my restaurant with all those bikers. With all of those dirty bikers your daughter hired to cut off my son's ears. And that baby was born. Weird day! Right! But we don't we don't have to reminisce about that. Wait. Does that have anything to do with me not getting accepted to the garden? (chuckles): Oh, of course not! Bygones. Well, my application was rejected again, and I was wondering if maybe I filled it out wrong. I did make a few jokes. Like where it asked, âWhat are your hobbies?â I wrote, âBeets me!â Get it? Spelled B-E-E-T. Ugh! Logan! It was an accident! Gah! It's hot! He probably likes it! Ugh, sorry, Bob. He's not We're working on it. No, no, he's a he's a great kid. (scoffs) No, he's not, but he will be. I'm trying to get him into this college prep summer program, but he doesn't have enough extracurricular activities. Like, uh, volunteering? (scoffs) Volunteering. Everyone's doing that. You can't throw a rock without hitting a kid volunteering at a hospice. Oh, I hate those kids who volunteer at hospices. The newest thing is crappy jobs that build character. You want to stand out, you write an essay about that. Oh. What qualifies as a crappy job? I don't know. Like sweeping stuff or mopping something. You know, just some dead-end job in a horrible place. I know a dead-end job in a horrible place! (doorbells jingle) BOB: Say hello to the newest member of the community garden! Hello. All right! Congrats, Dad. You did it, you old son of a bitch! And say hello to our newest employee! Logan? No! Dad! Uh-huh. Uh-uh. Uh-huh! Uh-uh! Uh-huh! Uh-uh! Uh-huh! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh, uh, uh! Uh, uh, uh! See? You two are already enjoying working together. (laughs): Okay, you got me. It's a joke. You'd never really hire Logan. It's just temporary, Louise. Logan's mom was nice enough to find me a plot at the community garden, because Because he gave me this crappy job. It's not crappy. Don't-don't say that. But if your mom asks, it's-it's crappy. Wait. You're paying this butt brain? My butt does have brains. They're called turds, and they're smarter than you. No, it's an unpaid internship. Finally, we're getting a little more sausage at this party. Yes, Gene. This is a terrible idea, Dad. You've taken the only good thing about this restaurant its lack of Logan- and you added Logan! That is not appropriate for the workplace. You are not appropriate for the workplace! You're not appropriate for your face! (groaning) (both groaning, blowing raspberries) I bet when you reconnect in your 30s, you guys will get married. Bob, if they're gonna just fight the whole time, he's not gonna be much help. BOB: Just let them get it out of their system. It's almost like they're playing. I'm okay with him. I can pick his brain about mid-teen boys. Find out what tickles their pits. That's a great attitude, Tina. Louise, can I see you in the kitchen real fast? Louise, I really, really want this garden. Plus, it will be good for all of us. We're gonna grow fresh produce for the restaurant. Doesn't that sound great? Dad, I'm nine. I spit out vegetables and hide them around the house. Louise, please, can you at least try and get along with Logan? Just for a little while? Do it for me? Fine. Great! Thanks. But the first time he even (sighs) Okay, I'm off to the garden! Is that my sun hat? Uh, yeah. Can I borrow it? I guess, but you look like a British lady. I know. Thanks. Bye. Oh, my dirt. My sweet, sweet, sweet dirt. Hello, trowel. You're gonna be digging. Hello, shears. You're gonna be trimming. I was so smart to buy you guys five years ago. Everyone said, ""You don't have a garden. Why are you buying gardening equipment?"" And I said, âI'll grow into it.â (chuckles) Trowel? Right? Uh, sorry. I-I didn't see I thought I was alone. Okay, Logan, fellow employee, this is the spot I've chosen for you to stand in for the rest of the day. It's out of the way, we won't have to smell or hear you, and when it's time to punch out, there's the door. Oh, you're gonna smell me. Smell it. Take in the aroma. (chuckles) High five. Wow, that was hard! I never knew high-fiving was so violent and satisfying! My hand is a man now! Your hand is a bro. It is? Let's bro again. (grunts) Ow! Oh, yeah. Gene! What? Everyone getting along out there? You know it, Linda. I'm in the mile- high-five club. Sounds great. Maybe I wasn't clear, Logan. You stand in your spot, face the wall, silently, till it's time to go home, and everything will be fine. The way I see it, as long as your dad wants his garden, I can do whatever I feel like. What? Yeah. Maybe I'll go back to this. Oh, somebody order a cup of cheese? 'Cause that's what it smells like. (yells) Come on, Logan. Let's-let's go in the back, and I'll show you how to wash the dishes. Uh, we-we can dish about the washing. (chuckles) So, uh, what do high school boys talk about? Follow-up question. Do you talk about it in the shower after you do sports? Additional follow-up question. How hot is the water? Does it produce steam? I'm asking for a friend. Yeah, that's classified, top-secret guy stuff, so Right, right, right, right. And towels- how small are they? Like washcloth size? Uh Smaller? (sighs) I'll start folding this. You say when. Huh? Huh? Mm. Uh. Huh? Ah Like, what I can't even fold it more. Hey, Mom, how you doing? Good. So, are we really sure this Logan thing is worth it? I mean, Dad's a family member, but he's ranked, like, fourth or fifth. Louise, it's not that bad. Plus, your father needs this. And you owe him one. You de-zested his zester. Let him have the garden. (groans) Sometimes you just got to be around people you don't like. Oh, look at this place. Oh, God, it's her. Oh, it's even more depressing than I remembered. How dare she. Oh, hi, Linda. I'm just here to help Logan with his essay. Don't mind me. Oh, I won't, Cynthia. What were you saying, Mother? (whispers): Something about people you don't like? Just pretend like I'm not here. Oh, but could I just get a chamomile tea? I'm sorry, we don't have that. Oh. Okay. Well, then just bring me some hot water. And a lemon and some chamomile tea. Oh, right, you don't have that. That's just so weird. Anyway, hot water and lemon would be great. Fine. Ew. Sticky. Logan? Logan! What?! I'm starting your essay we're gonna say you wrote! Come out here and sweep something so I can write about it! (grumbling) (grumbling) Well, good night. Good night. Okay, Bob, I'm just gonna say it. I know you love that garden, but now Cynthia's hanging out at the restaurant, ordering tea. (screams) Hi. If I could just jump in here, I don't know if I can take Logan much longer before I slap that mess. Yeah, how long is this gonna last, Bob? Uh, probably just until Logan gets into that summer program thing, and then we're home free. Rolling in arugula. So just try and ignore Cynthia and Logan. Start slapping faces, got it. No! No slapping. Just ignoring. Fine. But just so you know, I got this guy and this guy, and they're ready to go to work. Look at you. It's only been a few days, and you're so big! (high-pitched): We know. And soon, you'll be ready to get eaten. (high-pitched): What? Nothing. I didn't say anything. I for I forgot you could understand me, spoke English. I'm gonna tickle you now. Huh? Huh? (high-pitched laughing) (high-pitched): Oh, stop! Stop!  Tomatoes and sweet peas and green beans   It's a dream come true   I wanna take her stupid neck   And wring it   That's what I want to do, too, but with him   The only thing greener than these plants is my thumb   How did we ever get stuck with these bums?   The restaurans now a crappy place   I think I found my happy place   I'm like a British Lady in my garden   And my plants agree  Mm-hmm!  He's the most annoying person that was ever born   Oh, God, she brought her own tea   I'm the world's greatest farmer   Things are growing so well   We're living in our own personal hell   The restaurant's now a crappy place   I think I found my happy   The restaurant's now a crappy, crappy, crappy, crappy   Happy, happy, happy, happy   Place.  (burps, blows air) Ooh, windy in here, huh? Stop it! (burps, blows air) Ew! Something should close the door, huh? Stop it! High school age boys- they're a handful. Handful of this. (grunts) Gene! Sorry. ""These simple people were doing the best they could ""with what little they had in their sad, underperforming restaurant""? Hey, don't read that! âSimple peopleâ? It's just an expression. It's for the essay. You know what, Cynthia? Nope. Do it for Bobby, do it for Bobby. Uh-oh, we got a low-pressure system moving in from the north and a warm front moving in from the south. (burps, blows air) Stink-a-cane! Son of a bitch! Take shelter! Is âslop shopâ one word or two? You know what you should write about? A very violent event involving your computer and a simple lady who snapped! Kids, get a mop! You're about to clean Cynthia's laptop off the floor! Oh, yeah. Let's do this! Hands, time to get slappy. (exclaiming) Wha? Hi everyone. How are things going? Interesting but scary. Everything's going great! I was just about to proofread Cynthia's essay with my foot. And I was just gonna use my hands to make a Logan face sandwich. (both grunting) Okay, uh, good. Cynthia, hello. Logan, hey. So, uh, you know, a few bumps in the road are to be expected. This is more than a few bumps, Bob. This was a bad idea. Kiss your garden good-bye. Logan, we're leaving! Good! Great! Bye. Whoa, whoa, w-wait, wait. Where are you going? Yeah, Dad. Don't. Let them go. I'll, uh I'll handle this. Look, I-I'm sure we can figure this out. Is-is there anything I can do to fix this? I-I will do anything to make this work. I love your son. Look at Dad. He's really laying into them. GENE: Maybe I should go out there and hold him back. Nah, I don't think so. LINDA: Aw, big papa bear Bobby looking out for his cubs. You get 'em. LOUISE: I'm just glad this nightmare on Logan Street is over. There's got to be something we can do that will make you happy, make me happy, make your essay happy. All right, Bob. You told them off. Good job. Yeah, well, uh Did you hear someone yelling, âPlease Hammer, don't hurt 'emâ? That was me. Uh, yeah, yeah. Good. I thought you were gonna keep taking that doofus's side, then I saw you out there, and damn it if you didn't make me proud. Uh, okay. Um, a little news to share, everyone. Uh, a-after a lot of consideration, I've decided to make Logan employee of the month. - What?! Bob! Wow. He hasn't even been here a week. Good for him. N-Now, hear me out. Louise Ow, ow. You're hurting me. Ow, ow! Aw, Bob. (coughs) Oh, my kidneys. You're so small, but you're so strong. Him or me, Dad! It's for the greater good, Louise. Okay. I see. All right. (coughing) Oh, thank God. I quit! Damn it, I thought the glass would break. Anyway, I quit! The glass didn't break. High five! Great, Bobby. Great job! So Louise can quit? Quitting is an option? I want to quit. It would be fun to quit if I didn't love this job so gosh darn much. Nobody's quitting. Louise didn't quit. She's just going on a sabbatical. Great. I'll do that. No, only one sabbatical a year, Gene. And I'm taking mine next. Mm. This is not a big deal. I'm gonna go talk to Louise. Louise? Sweetheart? Sweet Pea? I know I don't call you that, but maybe we should start calling you that. I'll do that. Sweet Pea, how you doing in there? LOUISE: Perfect! Louise, making Logan employee of the month doesn't mean anything. I know it doesn't, because we've never done it before. Hey, I have a great idea. What if we make you employee of the month next month? I mean, Tina, technically should really be next; She works so much harder than you. Never mind. We'll make an exception for you. But Tina will be crushed. Sounds super, super great! Can't wait, Dad! Okay, good. So, good talk, right? LOUISE: Aw, the best. Good first step. (Louise groans) Uh, thanks for participating. Love you Cutie Pie? LOUISE: Ugh. - Sorry. I'll think of a better one than Cutie Pie. You're my Angel Dust. Sorry, that's a drug. I'm gonna go. Bye. Louise. When are you coming down? Mom has a stain on her apron. You're missing so much. How'd you get this number? Mom writes it on my leg every morning in case I get lost. Oops. I better sweep this up. Keep talking about whatever you're talking about. It doesn't have to be about your changing bodies, but it could be. Go. So are you coming down or what? I miss you! Oh I'll see you soon, Gene. (chuckles) But you won't see me. If Dad won't fire Logan, oh, I'm gonna make Logan wish Dad would've never hired him. Okay, bye. Oh, my God. Today was supposed to be overcast. No, it's a beautiful day. Shorts weather. Oh, no. No, no, no. What, Bob? I-I didn't cover my beans. You didn't cover your beans? It was supposed to be overcast! They're gonna die! Aah! I got to save the beans! Go! Damn it, Bob, you're frickin' nuts. Go! I'll be back in five minutes! Hey Scotty. Jacob. What's up? LOGAN: You liking those fries, brah? On me, my friends. I do whatever I want around here. 'Cause I'm employee of the month, so Ow! What the Who did that? Hey. Damn it. (quietly): Just spitballin' here. (laughs) Linda, I just need one photo of him with this employee of the month plaque in the restaurant. And maybe a few of him taking out the trash. Eh, why don't I take out the trash instead? Uh, bup, bup, bup, bup. I-I'm taking the photo. Dup, dup, dup, dup. No, you don't. Bob and I have a deal. Deal with this, honey. Oh, my face! Ow, my face! Okay, we're good. You guys are good, right? (high-pitched): Thanks, Bob. We were hot and scared. Oh, I'm sorry, guys. (high-pitched): Tell us a joke. No, I-I I got to get back. (high-pitched): Please? Just one? All right, just one. A kid's playing in a sandbox and he finds a welding mask. (high-pitched laugh) No, wait, there that's not the end. It's more. (high-pitched): Oh. Okay, a kid's playing in a sandbox. (high-pitched laugh) Who's hitting me with spitballs?! (gasps) Invisible spitball ninja. Logan, you got something on your face right there. (grunts) Stop it! Oh, and also right there. LOGAN: Louise, I know it's you. Where are you? LOUISE: I'm in your mind, Logan. There's a lot of room in here. (chuckles) Oh, I'm gonna find you. And I'm gonna get you. And I'm gonna (gags, coughs) My uvula! Employee of the mouth! (grunts) Linda, control your daughter! Ow! Hey! Ha, ha. Good news. The green beans are doing all right. Oh, you and that garden. You smell like dirt and fresh air. And it makes me sick! Ow! Your daughter's gone nuts, by the way. She's in the crawlspace shooting spitballs at everybody. Louise, get out of there. LOUISE: No! Not until you fire Logan. Ow! Hey. Louise, you come out of there right now. I don't want to do this, but you're not gonna be the next employee of the month; You're gonna be the last employee of the month, even after Gene! Sorry, Gene. Sorry for what? I wasn't listening. And I'm not gonna fire Logan; I'm keeping the garden, and you're gonna deal with it, Louise, because it's good for all of us. And not to bring up the zester again, but the zester. You owe me. And let me tell you something. Spending time in the garden has helped me realize a few things. We need to go outside more, okay? Why don't we go on walks? As a whole society? People should go out on walks! And people should garden! Bob? I hate to interrupt your flow. Great speech though, great speech. Yeah, it really got going after a while. Uh, Dad? Yes? We're not going on walks, are we? I don't know. Maybe. Anyway, while you were talking to the wall, Louise snuck in and took off with your gardening shears. What? Yeah. She looked ready to use them, too. I wonder on what. What could it beans? Oh, my God, my garden! Louise, just stop, okay? I get it, you're mad. Also, I'm getting a cramp. Oh, no! Better stop and stretch it out! Louise, you're literally running with scissors. Really big scissors. LOUISE: I know, it feels great! (panting) (fence rattles) Oh, good, it's closed. Louise, it's over! Come on, let's go home. (Louise grunts) Oh, crap. (grunts) Ow. God, how small are you? Say good-bye to your crappy crops. Ha! Don't have to. You don't know which plot is mine, Louise. Is it the one with the paper plate sign that says Bob's Beauties? No. No, no, no, no. You Louise, you don't have to do this! You didn't have to hire Logan either. Louise, please. Those are my babies. What? These. These are your babies? Yes. Those are Oh. Yeah. Why did I say that in front of my actual baby? Yeah! Right. Yeah, so maybe this whole garden thing was a little selfish. Yeah, I noticed how the greater good meant doing the thing you like to do. You're right. You know what? Do it. Cut them. Cut them down. What? Really? Yeah, do it. I deserve it. I can't watch. I can't. It's not their fault. That's right. It's my fault. So I'm gonna cut you. What? Just kidding. (chuckles) I know. Look, I'm sorry I hired Logan. I-I know how much you don't like him. Yeah, I'm pretty open about that, Dad. Plus, I mean, the restaurant is our place. And I like it that way. I know you do. I mean, sort of. I had a suspicion. But you do hide it pretty well. Thank you. I'm sorry I put my sweet peas before my Sweet Pea. Is that nickname thing working at all now? No. Can you forgive me anyway? Under one condition. You're fired! What? She can't fire me. Right? Of course she can't. Yeah, I think she just did. Louise is actually our human resources person now. And I'm executive vice president of new business! Oh, man, I've just been bussing tables. Logan, if you need a recommendation, here's one: Put a bag on your face. I'll put a bag on your face. Okay, hon, I'm gonna have security walk you out now. No. Well, I hope you enjoyed your last trip to the garden, Bob. Because it was your last trip. I know. That's why I dug up all my plants and brought them home. And I used your wheelbarrow. My You're not allowed to use that. It already happened. There's nothing you can do about it. And I broke the lock on your gate. (gasps) Which I will replace. Which is what you should do with your eggplant. It looks leggy. Logan, let's go. You're all nuts. Uh-huh, so if you want to shoot me your e-mail, I can just send you the rest of my boy questions. Absolutely not. ""Absolutely not"" at what .com? Bye, Cynthia. I spilled water on your laptop. Aw, she didn't hear me. She'll figure it out. Looking a little cramped. Yeah, we probably should've just planted one. Oh, no! Oh, God! BOB:  Tomatoes and sweet peas and green beans   It's a dream come true  LINDA:  I want to take her stupid neck and ring it  LOUISE:  That's what I want to do, too, but with him  BOB:  The only thing greener than these plants is my thumb  LINDA and LOUISE:  How did we ever get   Stuck with these bums?   The restaurant's now a crappy place  BOB:  I think I found my happy place   I'm like a British lady in my garden, and my"
"Another D on a math test. And if I don't get at least a B on the next one, I've got to go to remedial math. Remedial math, huh? On your first day in there, steal the biggest kid's pencil. Yeah, and then sharpen it and give it back. What'll I tell my grandchildren? I used to be bad at math. Oh, Grandma. I'm not going to remedial math, because I'm going to get a tutor who will teach me what my teacher could not. I don't know why we're getting yelled at. You know what's this weekend, Bobby? Valentine's Day. Oh, crap. I-I mean, I-I don't mean crap, Lin. I-I know you love Valentine's Day, I just feel like I never get it quite right. No, you do not. No, you're horrible at it. Well, I mean, a couple times, I got you something nice. Remember I got the oil change? Right. For the car? Right, yeah. That was for you. You did that, that was nice. Yeah. This year, you don't have to worry, 'cause I got it all figured out.  Ta-da!  Wow. What is it? It's a Valentine's Advent calendar. This year we're doing Valentine's Days. Valentine's Days? Say good-bye to the pressure of being super-romantic on one day, and say hello to being somewhat-romantic for a bunch of days leading up to the big V. Yeah! Behind each little door is a romantic activity that I've already thought of. Oh, you planned stuff. That's right! Huh, all right, uh, that sounds better. Right? Open up day one, Bobby. Come on, l-let me open it. No. Teddy, get off it! Come on, let me open it. Teddy, Teddy, give it Just let me open it, you can open up the other days. Teddy, let it go. Okay, uh ""Sexy cooking."" Sexy cooking I knew it. Yeah. I don't exactly know what that means, but if it means I'm not gonna screw up Valentine's Day, then I am in. I love it. We're in. Rosa. Rosa, Rosa. Darryl! Huh?! What? I need your help could you tutor me at math? Not taking on new clients. All my post-tutoring, pre-video-game free time is going to robotics. I'm building a companion robot for my grandpa. It gives him pills and plays jazz. But if I don't get help, I've got to go to remedial math. Ooh, that's tough. Good luck. Wait, what about tutoring me on Saturday? I'm not going to the Valentine's Day dance, so maybe And you assume because I'm a nerd, I'm not going, either? What? Oh, I'm sorry, I assumed you weren't going for a totally different reason. Yeah, I'm not going. That's it double nerd. Huh? Come with me, we got to talk in private. I'll tutor you if you'll be my date to the Valentine's dance. Oh, Darryl, I'm flattered, but I'm semi-involved with someone Jimmy Jr. He's semi-not-involved with me right now, but we're working through it. No, I don't really want to go to the dance with you. I want to go with Rosa Batista. Then why don't you ask Rosa? I can't she's out of my league. I'm in seventh grade, she's in eighth. I think she still sees me as the little boy that peed down the slide in second grade. Oh, that was you? I heard it was off a swing. Some of it may have gotten on the swing. But listen, do you remember who won Cupid's Couple at last year's seventh-eighth grade Valentine's dance? Um, Michael Carlish and Tracy Schwartz, right? And after they broke up, seventh-grade Michael Carlish started dating eighth-grade Jenny Testa. Whoever wins Cupid's Couple can date anyone they want when they break up. If we fake-date, we could win. And then if we fake break-up, I could date Rosa, and you could date Jimmy Jr. Hmm, but why would students vote you and me to be Cupid's Couple? Because of the double-nerd angle. I'm not a nerd. You kind of are. I'm not. We'll be too adorable to lose. A negative times a negative is a positive. That can't be right. We'll cover that in tutoring. So, do we have a deal? Uh Feels kind of wrong to mess with love. We'd have to be careful. I've seen enough romantic comedies to know you're probably gonna fall for me. I won't fall for you. Okay, it's just that you're probably gonna fall for me. Don't. I won't. Good, fight that feeling. I won't need to. Okay, fake boyfriend, let's fake do this. Your hand is sweaty like a forehead. I know. It's an issue. Oh, my God, are you two a couple now? You do the math. No. Um, yeah, we are. Well, nibble my dibble. How long have y'all been going out? A month. Since today. Uh, since today, but earlier. I never really thought about either of you that much, but you guys make a cute couple. Yeah, it's like neither of you are cute, but together you're cute. We're both humans who wear glasses! Whoa, volume, Darryl. Yeah, man, we're right here. You all right, buddy? Darryl, sweetie, will you come with me for a sec and check my hair for lice? Mmm-okay. We'll be right back. Ah, I'm losing so much water out of my palms! I'll be dead by morning! Pull it together, Darryl! Maybe I was wrong about this. I don't know how to be a boyfriend. You haven't dated anyone. And I've only dated two-and-a-half boys, but I've thought about boys and relationships a lot. Mm-hmm. Like, a lot. Uh-huh. I mean, a lot. Okay. So, how about this? You'll be my math tutor, and I'll be your boyfriend tutor. Okay. Like, if you don't know what to say, just give me a tiny side-hug. Uh? Um, oh, God. Okay, um, not like that. Ah? Decent hug, but do it silently next time. Good news, neither of us have lice. So, hello again, everyone. Aw, you guys look so cute together. Thanks, Rosa. You're welcome. B-Bye. B-Bye. Oh, bye. Bye. Are Darryl and Tina holding hands? Tina hasn't pined after Darryl for one second. And that girl can pine. Hey, Lin, can you take this to table four? Aah! What the hell was that? Sexy cooking. Oh, okay, right. She got ya! Whipped cream. Sexy, right? Very. Teddy. Uh, now's not really the best time, Lin. Come here. It's the lunch rush. Come on, come on. Also, can you take that burger to table four? I could, or you can try and find the strawberry I've hidden somewhere on my body. Wh-What are you talking about?  Find the strawberry   Strawberry trail  Mmm, no.  Yeah.  I don't know. Not right now. Wait, is that it, right there? In your apron pocket? Mm-hmm. So it's in there. Yeah, come and get it. Well, it's all dirty now, 'cause it's in your apron with a dirty dishrag. So dirty. Hurry up, it's getting all mushy. Well, I don't really want to now, it has a dishrag on it. Sure you do. I really don't. I don't want that one. You know you want to. No. Open up Mm-mm, mm-mm. Open up. No. Fine, I'll take a nibble. Mmm. Lin, you're gagging. Tina, hey, back from tutoring, I see. Have a seat, my sister. Sure. So, Darryl, boyfriend, you, girlfriend? Mm-hmm. Really? Really. Okay, you broke me! Darryl and I are pretending we're dating so we can win Cupid's Couple at the dance, and then we can go out with whoever we want, and I stay in normal math. I knew math was responsible! Please don't tell. If anyone knows we're faking, then we won't win. Right. Bribe, please. Okay. Well, the winners of Cupid's Couple get a $50 frozen yogurt gift card. I guess you guys can have that if we win. Shh You had me at ""gets a $50 frozen yogurt gift card."" Now, a boyfriend should always give his girlfriend compliments. Like, you could tell me I did a great job of opening my locker on the first try. I should compliment you on that? Especially that. My locker has a mind of its own, which I respect, but also sometimes I just need to get my books. Uh, okay. Hey, great job opening your locker on the first try, Tina. Oh, thanks. Whoa, that is some sweet talk. I know, right? It's so cute how their glasses reflect off each other. Yeah, like two mirrors that go on forever. Infinite stuff trips me out! Oh, no, there's a spider on your back. Ew! Get it off! Get it off! No, it's not real, it's my hand. It's a cute game we play, it's our thing. But I hate spiders, could it be a beetle? Sure. Oh, no. There's a beetle on your back. Aw! Bugs are, like, the new hugs. Cupid sure hit that couple right in the rump, huh? It's the romance of the century! And it has nothing to do with yogurt. I'm having a really good time with you tonight. I don't think everyone heard you. You got to yell over the music. Oh, right. : I'm having a really good time with you tonight. Oh, man, look at Chloe and Zack slow dance. They are so slow! Wow, they're barely moving. How do we compete with that? We cannot let them win Cupid's Couple. Hold on, I got a good idea. Hey, who's having a great Valentine's Day? Well, I'm having a greater time, because I'm here with the number one girlfriend in the world. Ti-na Bel-cher! Hi. Aw, I want someone to stretch out my name like that. Joce-lynn! Deejay, slow-jam me.  Girl   I wish you were   In all my classes   And when we kiss   We hit our glasses   Now let's   Slow dance   Like mol asses  Thank you, good night! Aw Wow, Darryl, where did that come from? Girlfriends like surprises. You taught me that. Hey, you know what might push us over the top right now? A kiss. Great idea. Let's make this look real. Wow, who knew Darryl was total boyfriend material? I know. I didn't know, but now I know, you know? We're gonna win this thing. We should probably kiss one more time. Just in case someone was tying their shoes and missed it. Right, good thinking. So are you ready to see what we got for actual Valentine's Day? I don't know if I am ready. It's, uh, it's been a rough week. Yeah. We've had some misfires. And an actual fire, yeah. Yeah. Ooh, ""Bubble Bath""! Well, it's hard to mess up a bubble bath. And Gene and Louise are asleep, so that sounds good. Oh, Bobby. Oh, hello, there. Get in here, you. It's nice and bubbly. Yeah, there's a lot of bubbles. Yeah, I used the whole bottle. You used the whole bottle? You're supposed to use, like, a teaspoon. It's, like, toxic. No. All right, fine, fine, it's fine. It's just a lot of bubbles. Come on, it's fun. It's like a paste in here. Yeah, right?! Feels like no water. Look at that. Oh. Let's just go with it. Yeah. But it stings. Just ignore it. Yeah, when it gets in your eyes, it stings. Ignore it. Come on, look at me. I'm just gonna get out for a sec, Lin. No I got to wash my face off. Gene! Ooh! I thought you were asleep. I thought I was, too. But then my bladder was, like, ""Get up!"" What's going on in here? Oh, God, no, Louise, you got to get out. I'm peeing, but after, I'm gonna make a sandwich and join Mom and Dad in the tub. Ooh, what kind of sandwich? N-No, Lin, no. Well, now I got to pee. Use the second toilet. Mom, Dad, can you get out for a second? Do you pee in here? Yeah. You're kidding me. Well, no. I'm in it. Well, I that's why I'm asking you to please get out for just a minute. Couple three. And couple four. All right, looks like the winner of Cupid's Couple is Darryl and Tina! Don't fly away, because you get a $50 gift card to Fro-Yo-Momma. We did it. I know. Girls are smiling at me. The theorem's working. Let's kiss one more time to seal the deal. We already won. Where's Rosa? I can't see Rosa. And one more time, for old time's sake. All right, well, I Okay one more. I guess Wait, that let's redo that one. So, now what? You and Darryl break up? And then Jimmy Jr. comes running? And Rosa and my math scores, according to Darryl's theory, which is probably right, since he's the smartest boy I've ever dated. Fake dated. Right, right. Fake dated. So, the breakup, is it gonna be classy or nasty? Definitely nasty. Want to know how many holds will be barred? Three? None. Wow, that is so few. You ready to do this? Maybe we should practice more. What if we break up tomorrow or next month? Nah, we got this. Showtime. For you, my sweets. A gardenia? My favorite flower? Aah, that's it! I can't take it anymore! What do you mean? You're just too kind and generous. It's making me sick. Oh, yeah? Well, you're too damn interesting, and it's driving me nuts. What's going on here? Cupid's Couple is having a quarrel and a half. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Your charisma is overwhelming me! Why can't you be un-charming for one damn second? I can't change how incredible I am. Just like you can't change how phenomenal you are. Then maybe we shouldn't date each other anymore. You mean break up, effective immediately? And date other people at this and/or other schools? It's our only choice! I wish I knew how to tame you, you wild stallion! Have a great life. You too, soulful wonder lady. Hey, Rosa, sorry you had to see that. Man, that was rough. Are you okay, Darryl? I'll be all right. : Thanks for asking. You're welcome. That was so intense. I thought they were going to last forever and ever. But instead they just imploded right before our eyes. So, Tina's single again? Why do you want to know? I-I don't care. Jimmy Jr. likes Tina! No, I don't. Look at Rosa and Darryl. That happened fast. The kid's a genius. Yeah, they're really hitting it off, those two. Good for them. Hey, Tina. Hello, Jimmy Jr. A bunch of us are going bowling tonight, and since you and Darryl aren't a couple anymore, I was wondering if you want to come. Bowling? Did someone say nachos? Um, I was kind of talking to Tina. This is just for older kids. Tina is insisting that we go with her and that she pay for us, because we know so much about bowling. Some might say too much. Wait, I don't get it. How could you know About too much about bowling? We know too much about Bowling. No. It's something else. Bowling. Uh-huh. So, I'm gonna take off. - Uh, well see you tonight. - Yeah. We know too much about the Cupid's Couple thing. Oh! Okay. Yeah, you can come. Look what's back. No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes. Since the kids are out, and the bubble bath was a little too bubbly for some, we're gonna finish strong with No. Striptease. Oh. Yeah. Ooh! Yeah. That could be fun. I'd like that. I'd like that, too. See you strut your stuff. Wait, me? Yeah. Magic Mike me, baby. Lin, you don't want that. Oh, but I do. Really? Okay. Then I'll do it. Yeah! Do it. But if I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna really do it, Lin. I'm gonna go all in. Bobby! If Bob Belcher strips, he's gonna strip serious. Like what? Like how? Like crazy. Like you've never seen, like you wa you won't even want it. Yeah! After 20 seconds of my striptease, you're gonna you'll want to leave. I'm gonna go shave my chest and pick out some music. Let's do it! Oh, maybe brush your teeth, too. Oh, right. Maybe floss. Okay. Yes. On your marks, get set, go. - Yeah! - Lane five, don't do that. What, don't bowl? Hm, feels like there's a strike in here. Huh. Those cheeks aren't leaving me weak like they usually do. Hell, yeah! Boom shaka-laka! That's my boy! Get over here! Come on. Get over here. Ow. Ow, ow, ow! Zeke, ow. Oh, Darryl. Come on! Come on! Ow, Zeke, ow! That's too rough. Come on! Rosa, don't move. There's a huge beetle on your back. Oh, no. Aah! I love it when you do that. That's-that's my favorite joke thing that we do. That's it! Oh, I can't take it anymore! Are you okay, Tina? Yeah, your face does not look exactly normal for a human. No, I'm not okay! Yeah, 'cause seriously, your expression is like None of this is okay, okay? I'm tired of lying. You need to know the truth. Tina, what are you doing? Oh, boy. Everyone Darryl and I only pretended to be a couple, so he could trick Rosa into dating him. And he would tutor me in math, but we didn't get around to much of that. We lied to you, and you all fell for it. That's weird. I'm outta here. Darryl, is this true? Uh Kind of? Well, then I kind of never want to see you again. Rosa, come back! Tina, what the hell are you doing? Um, I-I guess I guess You guess what? I guess I fell for you. What?! But we were pretending! Well, I wasn't. What a tangle-assed web we weave. You fell for me? How? Why? Because you did nice things and said nice things, and we had our special side hug thing. You told me to do those things. Well, can't you just be that guy? No, that guy doesn't even exist. But you fell for the Tina I was when we were together. No, I didn't. Let's assume you did and work backwards from there. No, Tina, we don't even like the same stuff. Sure we do. Do you like math? No. And video games? No And comic books? No. And going to the science museum? No You know who likes all those things? Who? Rosa! Rosa likes all that stuff! Oh, God, you and Rosa should be together. Yes, we should. I broke up a perfectly good relationship. Yes, you did. I need to get you two back together. Yes, you do. Oh, boy. I hope I'm as good at getting you guys back together as I was at breaking you up. Go, go, go, go, go! You're taking forever in there. You better not be using all my baby oil. Okay, I'm coming out. I started to shave, but I stopped. So don't look at my back. Okay. Should I hit play, or? Not yet. Oh, G Oh, my God. That's really tight. Okay now. Now, go. Party time. Well, well,  well. Ha ha! Did someone Just give me a second. You all right? All right, let me just come right back. Okay. All right, go, go Just stop the music for a second. I'll be right back. All right. I'm gonna look away. All right put it on. I'm ready, I'm ready. Here we go and play. Hey, there, lady. Did someone order take out, or should I say take off? Oh, yeah. How do you like that? Mm. Oh, you like it? Yeah! Well, it's just getting started. Let's get it down and dirty. Take it off, baby! Yeah! Ha, ha! How's this working for you? 'Cause this is my one move. Give it to mama. Let's orbit the Earth. Let's orbit the Earth. I like it. It's circular. Round. I'm getting dizzy. Yeah, yeah. No, this is what I practiced. Oh. Oh, yeah. Let's go the other way. Going counter-clockwise. You're terrible! Did you just hear something? Nah, nah, keep going. I think it's in the song. Keep going. Put on some clothes, big boy! Oh, my God. The curtain's open. Oh, God. What happened to your back? Nobody wants to see that. Hey! I do! Sorry. I was doing a striptease for my wife for Valentine's Day, all right? Valentine's Day was days ago. Give it up. All right, fine. I'm closing the curtains. Oh, no. Crap. They're not closing. I'm sorry, Bobby. This Valentine's Days thing was a bad idea. We just stink at it. We stink. No, no, Lin, you know what? I said I was gonna do it, so I'm gonna do it. All right? I'm gonna do it. Yeah? Take a seat, Lin. I'm going back on the table. Do it! Ow! Orbit the Earth. Orbit the Earth. Oh, Bobby, spin me right round. It's all coming off, baby! Ass! Rosa? Rosa? There you are. It's okay you didn't say anything back when I called your name all those times. Look, Darryl lied about liking me, but he didn't lie about liking you. You gotta give him another chance. Why should I? Because Darryl and I were a great fake couple, but you and Darryl can be a great real couple. And why would we be a great real couple? 'Cause you're looking at me and you're still blasting lizard guys like crazy. They're not lizards. They're snakes. And technically, they're actually demons from the black castle. Demons from the black castle. Ugh! I came here to get away from you. An arcade might not be the best place to get away from Darryl. Rosa, will you press two-players with Darryl for one game and see how it goes? No. No way. He tricked me into liking him. No. I realize now the only people that got tricked were me and Darryl. You and Darryl? I tricked myself into falling for a version of Darryl that I created. Then Darryl tricked himself into being confident enough to talk to you. Ugh! Leave me alone, all right? Forget it, Tina; Rosa's back to being out of my league. Damn it, there are no leagues! League bowling will now begin on lanes nine through 12. Okay, except bowling leagues. But there shouldn't be people leagues. But there are, Tina; That's just how it is. You're the one who thought you were out of Rosa's league. Not Rosa. Why, because you peed on the slide in second grade? You're the only one still holding onto that. No, I totally remember. Okay, so you and Jocelyn, and I remember, too. The point is, Darryl, if you liked Rosa, then you should have just gone and talked to her. Even if she remembered the pee thing. Could you just, um, stop bringing that up? Right. The pee thing? Yes. Rosa, I'm sorry. I should have just told you I liked you. Yes, you should have. So will you guys press two player already? Are you crazy? I'm on the black castle level! She's on the black castle level! Oh. We said the same thing at the same time. You know there's a hidden power-up on that level. Nuh-uh. Really? Want me to show you? Yes. Aw. They're like Mario and Luigi. They're so in love. Dang it, Tina's inspired me. Jocelyn? What? Could you scooch out of the way? I want to ask out that shoe rental woman. She's like 35, Zeke. And she's wearing a wedding ring. So? No leagues. I'm the only one holding me back, because I think I'm too bow-legged. But I'm not. Just the right amount. So let me waddle over here and just ask her out right now. Hey, baby! Well, mission accomplished. Absolutely. Except that Jimmy Jr. ran out on you. And you're probably gonna fail that math test. No. I may have failed Jimmy Jr., but I'm not going to fail the math test. I'm gonna ace it. Or at least get a B. In which case I'll ""bace"" it. Aw, nuts. I ""daced"" it. Remedial at love, remedial at math. Jimmy Jr., I didn't know you were bad at math. Yeah, real bad. You want to be bad at math together? Yeah, okay. Sure. Yes.  Girl   I wish you were in all my classes   Classes   And when we kiss   We hit our glasses   Glasses   Now let's slow dance   Like molasses   Molasses   Like mo-oh-oh-la-a-a-a-a-a-asses.  Thank you, good night!"
"Uh, lower. L-lower. L-little lower. Just a tiny bit more. - Uh - Yeah, in the trash. Now, stomp it down with your foot. Louise, I'm beginning to think you might not care about Jimmy Jr. winning this election. You're so wrong, Tina. I definitely don't care. Well, he's going to win. Henry Haber is the only other candidate, and his campaign slogan is ""chess we can."" Which game is chess again? The one with the checkers? Hi, Jimmy Jr., Zeke. Why is my campaign poster in the trash? Because it won't fit in the toilet. Doesn't matter the math club did a poll, and I'm up by 95 points. We're talking landslide, baby. Here come the mud! - Okay, don't landslide me, Zeke. - I'm gonna get you. - I'm gonna get you. Come on, come on. - Ow. Ow. Why do you even want to be president, Jimmy Jr.? To pick songs at dances. I hate it when it goes fast song, slow song, medium song. I want ten fasts, then ten slows. Guys, shh, Haber danger. Oh, hey, Habes you about ready to say Uncle? The election is still four days away. Ever hear of the tortoise and the hare? Uh, no. What're you sayin' about Jimmy Jr.'s hair? It's nice! - I mean, ""hare"", like, rabbit. Well, your hair looks like a weasel. What? That's - Fast song, fast song, fast song - Go, go - fast song, fast song, fast song - Go, go. fast song, fast All right, Jimmy Jr. For president. They got a lotta ladles. Ooh, I liked saying that. Lotta ladles, lotta ladles. - Lotta ladles, lotta ladles. - Lin. - Lotta ladles, lotta ladles, - Lin. - Lotta ladles. - Lin, look at this. What? A kitchen knife for $300. - $300?! - You think if I pick it up, a giant rock will come rolling at us? Wha? I'm talking about Indiana Jo Who the hell's Indiana Joe? - Whoa. - Bob? Hi, Louise! Crap! Millie! What are you sneaking up on me for? I have a new secret handshake for us. I bend your finger really far back. - Ow! And you bend my finger really far back. And then into a hug-shake! Stop hug-shaking me. Tina, get her off of me! Okay, um, can you let her go? So what's new, Millie? Oh, I'm just doing the fourth grade thing. You know, taking some classes, squeezing in some recess. All that running around doesn't leave enough time for my best friend over here, though. We're not best friends, Millie. Right, I'm your Nemesis we love each other, but we've got some history. You're not my Nemesis. We are, we're nemesises ses. We're rivals who are also totally obsessed with each other ""fremesises."" Oh, like Batman and Catwoman. And like socks and sandals. Millie, this is all in your head. We are nothing. Nothing! So we're on for lunch? No, we're not on for anything. I want a Millie-free zone around me, at least three lunch tables wide. Okay, three inches wide. Not three inches! Three tables!  Little bunny Lou-Lou   Hopping through the forest  I don't even know why we're talking, because I am not getting a $300 knife. No, of course. The Fukinawa is really only for professional chefs Well, I'm a professional chef, actually. Eh. Of course. - I am. - Absolutely you are. It doesn't mean I buy $300 knives. That are ""hand-forged by a master blacksmith in his mountaintop workshop."" Oh, boy, that's really good. - Why is that good? - Are we doing this? Okay, I'm recommending a I think we're doing this. Here, hold on. Spread it around. Chess we can. Mm-hmm, thanks. Another Jimmy Jr. Voter, huh? I get it, he's everybody's friend. Yeah, I'm not really political. I'd rather be everybody's president. You're their friend, but you're their boss. - Oh? You-you have power over 'em, to help them. Power - To help. - Power. Y-you're focusing on the power. Power. I should I'm gonna pass these out - Power. - Over here. No. I'm running for president, Louise. They use it for horror movies. Uh, Mr. frond? A fourth grader can't be president, right? Don't be a grade-ist, Louise. It's a young person's job. There's a lot of burnout. Button? Get that thing away from me. And good luck convincing anybody to vote for you. Thanks for your support! Good-bye, Millie. With all the ballots counted, Wagstaff's new president is Millie Frock. Ugh, I don't believe it! Louise, can you come up here, please? I want to make an announcement. No, thank you. Wrestling team, bring her to me. Ugh, let me go! Home ec class, sew her to my side. Metal shop, make a metal sculpture of us. Choir, sing my new school anthem.  Millie and Louise  Marching band, play the ""Millie and Louise overture."" Dance club, dance. Cheerleaders, cheer! No, no, no. Millie! Tina, wake up, wake up. Oh, what a coincidence. You watch me when I sleep, too? No, I want to join the Jimmy Jr. campaign. Welcome aboard. I'll show you how to use the puffy paints tomorrow. No, I know how to use them. I want to manage his campaign. But, um, that's what I do. Shh, shush, just go back to sleep. When you wake up, you'll be assistant campaign manager. But I'm the - Shh! Sleepy, sleepy. Millie is already up to one percent support. Our lead was this, now it's this. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean ""our"" lead? Did Tina die and make you campaign manager? No, I didn't die, I just fell asleep. Well, I'm really popular. I'm not worried about Millie. You should be. Last month we had to name the class chinchilla, and Millie had the worst idea of all. How about princess little piddles? I said what everyone was thinking. How about princess Fluffy vomit? Right, Millie? Is that what you're going for? You're gonna ruin this chinchilla's life. Then we all voted. And somehow ""princess little piddles"" was the name the class picked! Millie gets her way. I kind of want her to name me now. On to campaign strategy we've got to up our game. I can make another poster maybe I dot the ""I"" in ""Jimmy"" with a check mark? It's a little wild, but it just might work. That's a good That's actually a really good - Yeah. No, no posters print is dead. We've got TVs in the classroom. We need a commercial. The only thing standing between us and a Millie-ocracy is Jimmy Jr.'s dumb pretty face. Ow. That's the new knife, huh? Yeah, it's so responsive. It's, like, connected to my brain. I think ""chop"", and it chops. Yeah, I got a hammer like that. Us guys and our tools. - Chop. - Right away, Bob. Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop. I think we got enough onions, Bob. Do I tell you or that car payment you're holding? You can tell us both. It's a Mclecklin, my hammer. You know that brand, Bob? Mclecklin? I don't know hammer brands, Teddy. They're the best they're like the Meryl Streep of hammers. Ah, look at that slice. Uh, I'm not crying because of the onions, I'm crying because it's beautiful. And it's so thin, I could actually use it as a tissue. Ow, ow, that's a bad idea. I made a video of my hammer pounding nails. I put a Natalie merchant song under it. Dedicated it to my dad. Yeah, but your hammer and my knife It's not really the same thing. Want to read some of the comments, Bobby? Uh, I don't no. This guy he says, ""nailed it!"" Oh, the Internet. Before we begin, we have a message from one of the candidates for student body president. Settle down, it's not Henry Haber.  I'm Jimmy Jr. Pesto   You know I am the best-o   I'm cooler than the rest-o  He wrote the hot-guy manifesto?  We wish we were Jimmy Jr. Pesto  Key change!  I'm Jimmy Jr. Pesto   You know me from the vest-o   And I'm on a quest-o  To be the president-o?  You wish you were Jimmy Jr. Pesto.  Let's do this! Oh, barf. I want to slap that kid. I know, right? Oh I'm Tammy with Wagstaff school news. Our top story did a super lame ad take Jimmy Jr. From front runner to dumb bummer? We got reactions. I felt like I was covered in something gross, and I wanted to burn my eyeballs. Basically. I wouldn't braid his hair with your hands. What a. Sorry. We pooped the bed! This station is biased. I'm sure most people liked it. This just in Millie's gained 30 points on Jimmy Jr. Oh, man. Okay, a little setback. Manageable. Now we know what not to do, so we go hard the other way. Hang on, kids, we're going negative. It's 3:00 p.m. at Wagstaff, And a telephone is ringing. The bake sale is out of snickerdoodles. Maybe that doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is because some people really like them. Who do you want answering the call? A fourth grader with multiple tardies and multiple screws loose? Millie too dangerous for the bake sale, too dangerous for Wagstaff. Vote for Jimmy Jr. maybe. That was mean. Now I know who I'm voting for, for sure. Our big brother is mean? Is that what we're gonna turn into? I won't let you. I'm turning! Leave before I hurt you! Oh, boy. I'm here in the studio with Millie, the victim of a vicious Jimmy Jr. attack ad. Girl, how you holding up? I'm okay. I'm strong. I-I have to be strong. For Wagstaff. You know what, negativity always backfires. Jocelyn does it all the time, and it's lame, and she's lame. Not to be negative. This is a great interview. You know, you're really good at this. I know, I know I am. I want to endorse you can I do that? Mr. grant is shaking his head ""no,"" but I'm doing it. And I'm getting a new poll. Oh, my God, you're winning! Louise, what's going on? I'm supposed to be ahead. It's under control. Tammy just handed us the answer. Negativity backfires. Which means it also, uh, ""front fires."" Change of strategy. Posters, on it. Everybody like bubble letters? I don't know, they're pretty flashy. No, we go hard negative against Jimmy Jr. Huh? What? Try to keep up, pretty boy. Wait, what? Millie gets blamed. See, it's foolproof. I'm figuring this crap out, people. I'm feeling pretty confident now! Lin, I just cut a grain of rice into six pieces. Come look. - No! - Teddy, look at what my Fukinawa and I did. - Can't, Bob. I brought my Mclecklin in so I can finish off this birdhouse. Wait, what? You can't do that here. We're two guys with tools we love, making it happen. Teddy, stop you don't compare a stupid hammer to a Fukinawa knife. Stupid hammer? - And your birdhouse. - Oh, here we go. Oh, I understand. I understand that your weeny grapefruit knife isn't half the tool my Mclecklin is. Not half! - Take that back, Teddy. I'm not going to. You know what, we'll settle it. - Okay, you're on. - How do we do that? I don't know, it's probably impossible. Ugh, you men competing over your little toys. The only way I'm gonna care about this is if I get involved. Oh, I got it! Knifehammer olympics I got to plan the opening ceremonies. Wagstaff has questions for Jimmy Jr. Why does he dance all the time? What's he hiding? Does he have to go? Why doesn't he stop dancing and just go? Tell Jimmy Jr. to go to the bathroom already. By the way, here's his fifth grade picture. It's terrible! Paid for by students of Wagstaff of America for change. I'm down by 70 points? No one blamed Millie. Why won't people just think what we want them to think?! You turned Jimmy Jr. From hero to zero! It's not supposed to go that way! You took something beautiful, and tore it to pieces. I don't even want to hang out with him anymore! No, Zeke! No! No! I'm sorry, Jay-ju! She wrecked you! Oh, God. Okay, we double down! We go after Jimmy Jr. harder. Nothing's off limits the lisp, the weird brothers, dating Tina. I quit, Louise. Right, right. Take a break. Okay. Break's over. Back to work! Millie said if I dropped out, she'd let me pick songs at dances. It's all I wanted anyway. After all I've done! Good-bye, Louise! Ha-ha! Ready to wear my button, Louise? Never! Uh, Henry, hi, uh, hey! Meet your new campaign manager. First off, let's ditch those glasses. Uh, no, thanks. I've seen what your help can do. But we've got to stop Millie from becoming president, Henry! Then maybe you should run yourself. You can manage your own campaign. The combination of you and you should be unstoppable. Pretty sure you're being sarcastic, but you know what? That's a great idea! Louise for president, everybody! Two more ears! Two more ears! I don't know Louis. Do you really think You can beat Millie? - Yes. I'm way behind, but I've got core grassroots support from friends and family. And are you wearing a freaking Millie button?! Well, you've been the one acting crazy lately, not Millie! Because she's making me act crazy! That's how good she is! At least gene is loyal. And it has nothing to do with Millie being out of buttons! Nothing! Oh, Louise. You're so obsessed with me. I mean, I run for president, you run for president. Millie, I know you only want to be president so you can control people. Control me! This election is about Wagstaff. Let's take the U and the I out of it. Oh, look, now it spells ""lose"". That was in Louise's name all along and we never saw it! This is fun. Do ""Tina"". Just wait for the debate, Millie. I'm gonna pin you to the mat. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! And speaking of pins, Millie, get any more in or not yet? Here is how it works. The knife and the hammer will perform a series of parallel tasks designed to determine the biggest tool. Better tool. Bob, you will slice ten tomatoes while Teddy pounds ten nails into a board. Go! - Going pretty fast over here, - Teddy. Listen to that tone, Bob! - That's Mclecklin, baby! - Fukinawa's in charge! - Don't hit your thumb! - Don't cut off your pinky! - Done! - Done! - Tie! Round two. Switch stations. Bob, pry up Teddy's nails. Teddy, nail Bob's tomatoes back together and go! Nail tomatoes? All right, I took a shot. It took you a day to think of this? The next question is to Louise. What makes you best qualified to be president? It's pretty simple. I'm not Millie. People, Millie doesn't even want to be president. She just wants to be in my business. Live in my head and attach herself like a conjoined twin. Growing out of my side one leg, one arm, and a head on my head. Good answer. Thank you. Uh, okay. Millie, you have the floor. You've heard my platform. I would like to add that I would increase the budget for student counseling so that Louise can get the help she clearly needs. The help that I need?! That's like I'm also for longer recesses, a besties system, and bigger desserts! Yeah! Wait. Back up. ""A besties system""? I'm moderating, Louise! ""A besties system""? ""Besties"" it stands for ""buddying-up everyone with someone to improve the experience of school."" That's elegant. She's really good at that stuff. School's hard. No one should have to go through it alone. With an assigned bestie, you'll have someone to do homework with, someone to sit with at lunch. Someone who knows all your thoughts, who can finish your sentences! Here we go! What do you want to bet Millie assigns herself as my bestie, huh? Besties will be assigned alphabetically by first name. Hey, Zane! You and me, bro! Huh. Well, who does that put together? Oh, Louise and Millie. What a surprise! See, people? Millie's obsessed! It's me now. But tomorrow it might be you! Or you! Probably not you, boy sucking on watch. Oh, Louise, you need a bestie so bad! Aw, someone give Louise a bestie! She's so sad. And that concludes our debate. I think we know who won. No questions for me? Seriously? Oh, didn't see you up there, Henry. After-debate hug-shake! You'll like being my bestie. You'll have no choice! So, after five rounds, we're dead even. And we accidentally nailed the board to the counter. That was bad. Who knew nails were so long? Hmm. Sorry. But it gives me an idea for the next event. Who can make a hole in the counter first? Go! Oh, we're really gonna regret this! I'll fix it later With my hammer! No, you won't! You'll never fix anything with that! - Yes, I will! - I'll come back later. Bye, Mort! Hey, kid! Yeah, kid! You, yeah! Hey, come on, vote for me! Come on, help a candidate out. Oh, gross, she's still running. Don't make eye contact, just keep walking. I saw you, Jocelyn! Keep walking, keep walking. I'm a human being! Look at me! I'll vote for you, Louise. Thanks, Andy. I'm Ollie! Forget it! Which one am I? I'm gonna lose. Oh! ""Follow the braid, check the files, what you find will make you smile."" Maybe someone who wears braids. Snoop dogg? Follow snoop dogg. I already do. Mostly retweets and recipes. Braids! Abby! But how does she figure into this? Attention all students to the gymnasium. Voting for Mill president will begin in 15 minutes. We've got to sneak into frond's office, and see what he's got on Abby. Okay, good luck. I have to go vote for Millie, bye. No, Tina! I need your help. I need an extra pair of hands. You messed up the campaign. You wouldn't listen to me. Yes, but party loyalty? We're both registered belchers. I am a belcher. Yay, us! The farty party! Quick, we'll dig through his files until we find something! And we'll dig through his zen garden until we find enlightenment. Or a clam. Look at the size of this file. That's Abby's? No, it's yours. Here's Abby's. Oh, my God! This changes everything! We've got to get down there before the vote. What are you doing in my office? What are you doing in your office? I came up to get a little rubber thing for my finger to count votes with so I don't have to explain myself! It's my office! Oh, we were just leaving. Get comfortable. You're not going anywhere. Who-who touched my zen garden?! It's gonna take me all afternoon to re-zen that thing. - Please let us go, Mr. Frond! - No. Frankly, Louise, your behavior lately has been extra erratic. You need some counseling. Gosh, Mr. Frond, you're right. I think I might be on the verge of a breakthrough. - Oh, good. - Breakthrough! Damn you for making me run! We got to wrap this up, Lin. I mean, it's not great for business. We totally screwed up the counter. And nothing's settled. If anything, we've raised more questions. I'm gonna say we're still even. And there's only one thing left. Knife against hammer! Hammer against knife! Metal against metal! No way. We're-we're done. A tie is good. Yeah, Bob loves his knife. I'd hate to destroy it. My knife was made with hammers, Teddy. Hammering would actually make it stronger, so Whatever you want to tell yourself. I get to go first! Five second rounds. Go! Fukinawa, go! Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop! Ding! Hammer time! Mcleckli die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Aah! It's not getting stronger! Fukinawa! Teddy, you can stop! It's dead. We got a winner! Let me see that thing. God, I really want a Mclecklin. Ah, good, we're not too late. Everyone, before you vote, I have something to say to Millie! And I want you all to hear it! Just give up, Louise! I have. I just want to say to Millie early congratulations, and you know what? I think being a bestie will be fun. Wha-what have you done with Louise? Oh, by the way, I won't be your bestie. I'll be Abby's. - Sorry? Oh, you didn't know? Abby's real name is Mabel. ""Mabel"" comes between ""Louise"" and ""Millie."" Your alphabetical rule. Wait a minute Abby is Mabel? Abby's actually a nickname for Mabel, but no one knows that, so I guess I'm not talking to you, Abby! Oh, okay. Mabel, you still into braiding? Want to take a whack at this mop? Do you like French braids or a fishtail? Hey, you're my bestie, you decide! Yeah, well, whatever, we still might end up being besties. Except we won't. I'll be Abby's. I mean Mabel's. Whatever. Whatever. But hey, we can talk later. Let's vote. Yeah, let's vote. But let's talk now for a minute. Because we will be besties, Louise! Yeah. But no. Look, it's your rule. Well, when I'm president, I'll change the stupid rule, okay? The new rule will make us besties! And if it doesn't, I'll change it again! And I'll change it again! Because you will be my bestie! And if I have to get rid of Abby or Mabel or whoever, I will! Careful, that's a five-strand braid. Took me all morning! Millie! And scene! Um If elected, I'll-I'll start an improv club. Let's do one more. Okay. Someone throw out a-an, uh, occupation And an animal? I heard fireman? And pig? Did somebody say pig? I think Millie just lost. Impossible the only losers in improv are the audience. Wait, do we still like her? We don't, right? She's gross, right? Millie is disqualified for attacking Abby. Louise, you were second in the poll. You're going to be president! Whew, head rush! I'm already a little drunk with power! Louise is disqualified for breaking into my office. Oh. So we're out of candidates. No president this year. Uh Oh, wait, Henry Haber. Congratulations, Henry Haber. Hi. Uh, today my vote really counted. In my country, before the coup, I was president. You are so freaking lucky, Henry Haber! Luck. Is that what you want to call it? Uh, yeah. I guess I was just lucky when I figured out that to get rid of Jimmy Jr., I had to lure Millie into the race. And I guess I was just lucky when I knew that she would pull you in on the Jimmy Jr. side, and that you would tank his campaign. How could you know that? A chinchilla named princess little piddles told me. What? My younger brother Hogarth saw the whole thing. That name didn't have a chance till you went overboard dumping on it because it was Millie's idea. And all the kids felt bad for her. Millie makes you completely irrational. I'm not irrational. She just drives me totally insane! Then I had to take care of Millie. So I got you to run. Then I helped you take her down in a way that also took you down. We were pawns? I believe you mean ""prawns"". You can't be that smart. Chess I can. Wow. Brains and brawn Is what I would say if you had the brawn part. How can you play with people's lives like that? Who the hell do you think you are, Henry Haber? You're gonna be an amazing president. I was an amazing president. What happened? Mmm coup."
"Hey, this stool is making a new sound when I spin on it. It's somewhere right between seal the animal and Seal the amazing singer. I'd buy that stool's album. Hey, hey. No having fun. You kids are grounded. Here's something fun. I need someone to run the old grease out to the Dumpster. Don't talk about Mom that way. Mom, are you still mad? You grounded us four hours ago. We've grown so much since then. Yes. I'm still mad. And I'm gonna be mad about it forever. - But it's the weekend. - Everybody's supposed to go to Bernie's! Come on, Lin. I-I know you No! Can I just L-Lin. Not talking about it. Ever. Oh. Here comes Aunt Gayle. And I know this sounds crazy, but she looks like she's crying. Oh, God. She can't just stop by, can she? Why don't we have a panic room? Well, my life is ruined. Oh, God. What's wrong? Oh, Linda, you remember that guy I met on Cat Chat? Stacy? Yeah Wait, men can be named Stacy? I love America! Well, we were supposed to go see Yarnival it's like Cirque du Soleil but with cats and then he canceled. So I guess I'll take Bob. Oh. Uh, no. No, no, no. No. J No. I'll go with you, Aunt Gayle. We've been meaning to hang out for ages but couldn't make our calendars work, remember? No, take me! I yearn for yarn. Please, Gayle! I need to breathe outside air! I need to touch the wind! Wow, you guys really want to hang out with me. Ah, they only want to go 'cause they're grounded. - Why are they grounded? - Well No reason! I just felt like it. They're not allowed to go. Okay, fine. I'll go by myself. That's okay. I can use the empty seat next to me to slump into when I die alone! All right, fine. One of them can go. I don't care which one. They're all equally terrible. Eeny, meeny Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up there. You have to let us compete for it. To the death. No. No death, Louise. Or we could, I don't know, maybe go by, uh, who has the biggest ding dong. Gene. Mmm? No. I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna do something you hate. Let me see. What do you hate? - Nachos? - Homework. That's what you're gonna do. You're gonna do math. Or we could write essays. How dare you. Never! What a great idea, Tina. I love it. Since I'm the one with the tickets, I want the essays to be about me! I want action, adventure, love, drama. And Scott Bakula. Oh, God. All right, you heard the lady. Your time starts now! And time. Pencils down. Okay, who's up? Who's gonna read? I'll go first because I have the biggest ding dong! - Gene. - Mmm. My story is called ""The Ballad of Gayle and Jo Gene."" And I hope you brought your hankies and some toilet paper, 'cause there's not gonna be a dry eye or butt in the house. The place: Nashville, Tennessee. It was a hot, sweaty night, and the patrons at the Fiddle of the Road Saloon couldn't wait to hear their favorite act, Lindette and Jo Gene. They had the glitz and glam to make you say, ""Hot damn!""  La, la, la, la, la, la, la  Lana loves a llama, but the llama loves pajamas. Y'all sound great, Lindette. I better. Lou Belchera is here, the big fancy Hollywood singing agent. So don't screw it up for me. A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.  Oh, the sheriff had a piggy   And he was mighty mad   He saw me a-coming and my wiener he did grab   Now I can't quit cryin' and life just ain't no fun   'Cause a fat dog ate my hot dog   And I got nothin' but the bun.  Yeehaw! Wow. Wowee, wow, wow, wow. Hi, kids. I'm Lou Belchera, Hollywood singing agent, and I'm gonna cut to the chase. I like what you did out there. I liked it a lot. And I'd like you to be my client and compete in the Big Ole Opry sing-off next Friday. What do you say? We say yes! No, not you, fumble weed. The tall one with the big yams. - I'm sorry, but we're a duo. - No! I'm going solo! - Wait, what? No. - Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!  Yes  But what about me?! What about you? You heard her. I'm a star. No, not yet, you aren't, lady. But if you win the big sing-off tomorrow night, I'll take you to Hollywood and give you a mansion and introduce you to, uh, I don't know, Mr. Scott Bakula? Yay! Get out of here, Jo Gene. I'm like a rhinestone rainbow and you're like a trunk full of wet boots. Fine! But I'm taking the rest of the cold cuts! And my sequin tube top! And my dreams! And the pepperoncinis! - Take whatever you want, you little pig. - And the cruditÃ©s. - Don't you touch that cruditÃ©s! - It's mine! Shot of hot fudge with a root beer back. Leave the bottle. Tough night, huh? My singin' partner up and left me. Oh, man. My singin' partner up and left me 15 years ago. But look at me now. I'm doing great! Here it comes. Oh, God. - Ah! Gayle! Come clean up this throw-up.  There's lipstick on his pickup   There's mascara on the wheels   I looked inside the glove box   And I found a red high heel.  Well, pinch my loaf. That girl can sing. Those pipes you got sound like they came straight from heaven. Ugh, the bathroom pipes? Sorry they're clogged. People keep putting tampons down 'em. Even the sinks. No, no. I meant your pipes. Your singing ones. My name's Jo Gene, and I'm looking for a new singing partner. I'm not really a singer. I'm just a beautiful waitress who cleans up throw-ups in a bar. Not anymore you're not. Let's get you to the all-night Rhinestone Warehouse quick. The preposterous ostrich's legs were monstrous. Sally Struthers' other brother's her mother. Well, howdy, former pardner. Wha? What are you doing here, Jo Gene? I came here to win with my new partner! We've got this in the bag. But not this bag I'm holding, because that has my sandwich in it! Get out of here! Ah! Not my eyes! I need them for eye exams! Psst. Hey. Stage girl. - Yes? - I need you to put a rattlesnake into someone's guitar for me. Yes, ma'am.  I'll   Trade you these tears for a couple of beers   And this snot for a shot of whiskey  Oh, she's good. Yeah. She's real good.  too frisky.  Let's hear it for Lindette! Now a brand-new duo. He used to be Lindette's partner, and she used to be a waitress who cleaned up throw-ups. Let's give a big Nashville welcome to Gayle and Jo Gene! We call this one ""I Won't Go Solo on You.""  Well, I got to use the restroom   But there ain't a stall for two   So squeeze on in and don't breathe in   'Cause I won't go solo on you  Um, I think there's a snake in my guitar. Use it.  Well, I'd like to eat spaghetti   But you want vindaloo   So I'll leave in a hurry and order some curry   'Cause I won't go solo on you   Oh, you and me   You and me   We're together through and through   So if you move to China   I'll be right behind ya   'Cause I won't go solo on you.  Yeehaw! And the winner is Gayle and Jo Gene! And that wacky snake! What? That's my snake! I should win! Oh, my face! So Lou Belchera signed them and took them to Hollywood, where they saw the Hollywood Sign and met Scott Bakula! I come to the second ""O"" in the Hollywood sign when I'm feeling sad, but, oh, boy, am I glad I met you. And Lindette ended up married to the old drunk from the bar because she was a mean person who liked grounding people and going solo. Aw, nuts. The end. Oh, I just loved it, Gene! Well, I hated it. Boo. You win, Gene!  I won't go solo on you  Come on! Let's go! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! What about my story? And more importantly, my story. Oh, right, right. My story is called ""Lady Chatterteeth's Lover."" The sisters Chatterteeth were the most beautiful sisters in all of Withering Wharf, especially Gayle. She was what you'd call a ten. She had an almost equally beautiful sister, Tina. She was like a nine. Nine and a half, maybe. Also there was Eugenia and Louisa, but they were less important and not that much fun in general. Though Gayle was extremely beautiful, she was also extremely shy. Gayle, could you please pass me the bread? Sorry. I can't. I'm too shy. And the sisters were poor. Very, very poor. My petticoats are unspeakable! The sisters got by as seamstresses, sewing the butts back on to soldiers' pants when they were shot off in battle. Mmm Tina longed to marry Lord Jimmy Jr., whose butt had been spared in battle, but according to the law of the land, she couldn't do so until her eldest sister Gayle was married first. So many fallen butts. Why for not can there be an end to this war? At least we have the Rich Man's Ball to look forward to. Pass. Oh, dear sister. I cannot go to the ball. I'm far too shy. But, sister, until you marry, none of us can marry, either. I want a wedding! But instead of a wedding cake, I want to get a bunch of cupcakes because it's a long time ago, so that idea is still good! I am afraid I'm far too shy. We're all going to die alone because of me. Don't be mad, though, 'kay? That was the night that Tina decided she had to find a match for Gayle.  It was mere days before the Rich Man's Ball, and so Tina had to find Gayle a suitor and with haste. Tina tried every eligible bachelor she could think of, but unfortunately she could only think of one. Theodore the blacksmith. Thank you. Whoa, what do you call this thing? It's a cup. Say it again. A cup. It's amazing. You've never seen a cup before? Nope. I drink by sticking my head in the river. Oh. And what's this? What's what? Uh, this thing all around us. A house? How are you saying that? House? No, house. House. How-use. How-use. How-use. House. House. House. Oh, God. How-use. How-use. House. So quick. House. And what about what about what about what about what about But alas, Gayle's heart remained empty. Until he showed up. My horse broke down in front of your cottage. May I use your old-fashioned ink pens and paper to alert my family and friends to my delay? Then I will send the letters with my servant, and my family will receive the letters right before I get there. It's a pretty good system. Of course, sir Sir Bob. Belcher. Lord and heir to the Belcher Burger fortune. Oh, my God, that's Bob. Why, you're the lord throwing the Rich Man's Ball, are you not? And who is this? Ah! Your ankles are great. Ah! Her name is Gayle, and she's not married. And if you like her ankles, you should see her shins. Her shins go on for inches. You better not be marrying my Bob off to Gayle, little missy. Ugh, just let me finish, okay? Well, Gayle, I hope I shall see you at mine ball. Oh! Ah! Ah. Should I, uh, pick her up? Nah, we usually just let her sleep there when that happens. Oh. Wait. No, she's on fire. Let's move her. The date of the ball had arrived. Everyone from town was there. Wow. Everyone from town is here. Even Lord Ken the albino! Ken! Oh, I can't wait to see Sir Bob! Yeah. Have fun with that. I'm gonna go put a bunch of crumpets down my corset. Gonna leave this place with a month's worth of food. Hello, Gayle. What is that lovely sash about your waist? I call it a fanny pack. - It's very fetching. - Oh! Hi, Lady Tina. Hi. I hope you like the band Boys Fore the Present Tyme. They are very popular in the city. Come, let's dance. They're playing the Heinie Liney. Oh!   Tina, seriously? Dad, please! I'm almost done. Sir Bob and Gayle danced together all evening. They couldn't take their eyes, or butts, off of each other. Where's my sexy fiancÃ©?! Where is he?! Bob! Uh, here I am. Uh, hi honey. I can't believe you'd have a ball without me, your loud, rude, American wife-to-be that you're marrying for money! Come here! Give me a kiss! Whoa. Uh-uh. Aah. Gayle was so heartbroken over Sir Bob that she fell deathly ill with pooping cough. Her sisters tried everything to bring her back to health. Leeches. Yum! Beaches. Screeches. Wake up! Stop being sick! But nothing worked. They called the vicar to come give her last rites. I'm the vicar, Scott Bakula. Well, hello! I'm feeling much better all of a sudden. Oh, good. Well, let me whisper a prayer into your mouth. Oh! Then they Quantum Leapt into the future to the day of their double wedding with Tina and Jimmy Jr., and they all lived happily ever after. Mmm. And Sir Bob and Linda were also married, and then they had a baby with a tail because they were cousins. The end. That was so good! Oh, I could feel Scott Bakula's kiss whispers in my mouth! Kisspers! Ah, I've heard better. And your father and I are not cousins. That we know of. You win, Tina. Oh! Or should Gene win? Oh, gosh, this is tough. I think you're forgetting something. Oh, right. Okay, go ahead. I call it ""Gayle of Thrones."" Pace yourselves, guys. You're gonna want to save your gasps. Behold the tale of Queen Gayle of Catsteros. She was the most powerful woman in all of the nine Cat-life kingdoms, and mistress of the world's only cat dragons. People of Catsteros, please eat, drink and be meowy! Your Royal Highness meow visitors from the kingdom of Litter Boxia! Lady Gayle, we come on behalf of your sister, Lindaryen of Litter Boxia, to present you with a gift in her absence. A gift? I'm surprised. She's always been jealous of me because I have cat dragons, and I'm not a cranky old hag. Oh, well, she didn't mention that. And now, may I present, this guy! I'm Gene from the House of the Unfarting. My Queen, I am a warlock. If I disappear, just check your rear. Blee. But don't worry. I always turn up. Blee. Just never where you left me! Oh, impressive. He was over there meow and now he's over here. Meow. I'm befuddled. I love your cat dragons! I'll take them in my wagon. Blee. Wha? I'm checking my rear! He's not there! And he took my cat dragons! Blee. Here I am. Oh, phew. Blee. - Just kidding. - No! My cat dragons are gone. I must go get them. They are my children. They've suckled at my teats! Ew. At least let our bravest knight go with you to assist Your Grace. Meow. My Lady Gayle. Knight Louise, this is my fight. I cannot risk your life. But I can. Plus, I really dislike Lindaryen. She's a tyrant who punishes children unjustly for doing hilarious pranks. I swear my service and my steel to you. The Burgarean Slapper! Let us be off. My cat dragons are probably very confused without me and my breast milk. People of Catsteros, remain here, remain strong. I will return with our dragons! And then I shall breast-feed all of you! Oh. And so they set off for Litter Boxia, fighting their many enemies along the way. They were held prisoner by Theus of Grimward, Thannis of Grinjammed, and Thambis of Gramjimnt. But each time, they escaped. There are the gates of Litter Boxia, My Queen. Wow, it really stinks here. Yes, Litter Boxia has not been cleaned in many moons. And outside of Litter Boxia, the most dreaded monsters in all of the Nine Cat-Life Kingdoms. Hark, my lady. A sound ahead. What is it? It sounds really boring. It's a White Talker! Cover your ears, or they will literally bore you into a deathlike slumber. I tried everything to get that barbecue stain out of my underpants. The best place to park at the hardware store is probably the parking lot. Oh. Oh, I have an itch. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, it Oh, it's so itchy. Oh, I got to itch it. Don't itch it! Oh, I can't wait any longer! Do not take your hands off your ears! My lady, no! Oh, I got to itch it. Oh, God! Oh, oh! Ugh. Oh, no. He got me. So boring. I'm so bored. Louise! Who goes there? It is I, Gayle, Queen of Catsteros. I seek my sister Lindaryen. She has stolen my dragons. Oh. Okay. So you're Gayle. Okay. Just go in or whatever. Hi. Everyone, listen to me sing!  La, la, la, la-la-la-la-la.  Bobdor. Gayle! Sister. Surprised to see me? Not at all! I knew you'd come, and I knew when you did I'd get rid of you once and for all! I challenge you to a duel. To the death? Yes! But let's do that thing where we pick someone to represent us and fight in our honor, and then die in our place, right? Oh, good idea. I choose The Mort-tain! Mm, uh. Huh? Oh, okay. Um, hang on. Sorry to do this, Louise, but I need you. Aah. What-What's going on? I need you to fight for me in a duel to the death. - Oh! Good. - Enough talk! Let the duel commence! But let's make this fight a little more interesting. Be careful not to fall into my pit of ravenous porcelain babies. They haven't been fed in days. So hungry. Thanks for playing, big guy. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh, crap. Shouldn't have done that. Well, you beat me fair and square, but I'm gonna kill you anyway. Bobdor, throw 'em into the pit. Bobdor. Does that mean yes or no? 'Cause it's the only thing you ever say. Bobdor. Yeah, that doesn't help. I got to get a new fool. Maybe somebody thinner. I want somebody hot. What-what are you doing? Aah! Ow! Oh! My babies are eating me! Oh, bad babies! Down! Thank you, Bobdor. I'll breast-feed you first when we get back to Catsteros. All right, everybody, let's go home. Scott Bakula?! Where did you come from? Does it really matter? Bobdor third wheel. Bye-bye. Bobdor! The end. Louise, you haven't watched Game of Thrones, right? No. Game of what? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, Louise, that was so good. Yup. You're just all such wonderful nieces and nephews. I don't need Stacy. You've shown me that I'm talented and lovable and strong Hey, Gayle. Still up for that date? My emergency canceled. Stacy! How'd you find me? All those messages you left me at work and at home and at my mother's telling me where you were going. Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay, let's get out of here! Bye, kids. No! No! Son of a bitch! Mom, come on. Are we really still grounded? We were just trying to be funny. Yeah. We tried to make you laugh, but instead, you made the world laugh. Uh-huh. It did sound kind of funny. Hey, uh, Mom, uh, can we get some ice cream? Yeah. From that case right there. Yeah! Ice cream. Yummy. Good idea, girls. Freezer Frankenstein! Oh. Uh. Whoo. Oh. Whoa. Lin, you fell into a pile of maxi pads, and you farted. It's pretty funny. It wasn't funny! Everyone laughed at me. Yeah. Yup. Yup. And then I had to buy all those maxi pads. Oh, it's gonna take me weeks to get through those! And then I farted again when they handed me my bags. Mom, it was perfect. Don't you see? I'm proud of you! You farted your way into our hearts, Mom. Okay. It was it was funny. It was funny. So, we aren't grounded anymore? Tell you what. You're grounded for tonight, and you all have to watch TV with me. All right, it's something. And we're gonna watch whatever I want, and we're gonna be a big snuggle sandwich. I'm the cheese, right in the middle, and everyone likes me! Wait, where are you going? We're not closed. We-we don't close for hours. - Bye, Dad! Wai-wai-wai-wait. Don't close the d They closed the door. I should have gone with Gayle."
"Got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read. Wow, I feel the exact opposite way. Why are you saying that? Book report. I wrote the due date on my arm so I would remember, then every day since then, I've taken a shower like an idiot. When's it due? Tomorrow. Ah! What page are you on? The cover. Call of the Wild? Is it about an insane telemarketer? Or Gene in the bathroom? I don't know yet. Hey, kids. Oh, Bob, this package came for you earlier when you were putting out that grease fire. See, that's why I hate school. We miss all the grease fires. Huh, I wasn't expecting anything. Oh. Oh, yeah. I-I remember ordering this. What the hell is that? I bought a remote control version of the helicopter from the movie True Lies, complete with a clutching Arnold Schwarzenegger and dangling Jamie Lee Curtis. Hmm. Oh. Hmm. Huh. What a beaut. Were you drunk shopping? No. I call it ""nighttime shopping, with wine."" I bid on an auction and, uh, yeah, helicopter. Mm-hmm. Fly, you bastard, fly! Hold on, Jamie Lee, I gotcha. I'll save you from Tia Carrera, I think. I forget the scene. Hey, when does Mama get a turn? I want to save Jamie Lee. Lin, I just started. And I think I'm really good at this. This could be, like, my new thing. Dad, you don't want to be, like, too cool. Hello, boots. Hanging like you do every day. Give it. Geez, Lin. All right, let me just bring it in for a landing. You can't pull off that look, buddy. It's not you. Gentle, gentle, and kiss the ground. What the hell? How did that happen? I landed it perfectly. T-T-Ti Well, it had a good run. Of one. That thing is a piece of crap. I'm getting my money back. T-Ti-Tina Well, maybe it's okay. See? Oh, no, it's dead. Squi-Squi-Squirrel.  I'm reading   I'm reading  Oh, Tina. Tina! Tina! Ah. Thanks, Dad. I hate getting hit on the head by boots. Uh, you're welcome, Tina. Should we throw them back up? I kind of feel bad. They've been there for so long. Look out, Tina! I just froze. ""And following a skillful landing, ""it broke into a million pieces. Please issue me a full refund of $45 plus shipping."" And send. That thing was 45 bucks? Plus shipping. Which was also 45 bucks. The hell? Ugh! What's wrong with me? I just watched everything happen! The squirrel, the boots! And I did nothing! Hey, let's all be quiet so Tina can read. Who said that? Face it. I'm not heroic like Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies! I'm not even Tom Arnold in True Lies! Or even in Roseanne! Come on, Gene. Don't worry about it. That was just part of being a dad. You'll have those instincts someday. But what if I never get those instincts? Maybe I'll just grow up to be a very handsome coward! Dad, you saved Tina! You're a heroic man of action. I can learn from you. Gene, I-I think you're blowing this out of proportion. Though I did react with a certain amount of grace - under pressure. - What the hell?! ""Sorry, I don't give refunds for crash landings""?! ""Heliflopter""?! All right, new plan. His number's on the Web site. I'm calling this guy. He's doing it! He's man-of-actioning. Which I call ""mactioning."" Hello? Is this Sheldon Felds? This is Bob. That's it, Dad. Give it to him. No, not Bob the crash-lander. It kissed the ground, Sheldon. Kissed it. Maybe I should've just bought it from The Hobby Hole. A real store. Hobby Hole! Well, how about I just come on down and demand my money back? Yeah, your address is right on the package. So see you soon, Sheldon! Oh, and, also, your handwriting is not very good! Nice one, Dad. Bob, don't you think maybe you should just let this go? You know how you get. You start saying ""It's the principle"" over and over. It's the principle of it, Lin, the principle. Yep, there it is. Wait, how did you know I was gonna say that? I've never said that. Right. Yeah. Right. It's the principle of the thing, sir. It's the principle! Prin ci ple! Oh, well, it is the principle. And someone's got to stand up for what's right! Things are pretty loud, so I'm just gonna put my fingers in my ears. Whoa, that's waxy! Am I shouting?! I'm going over there. I'm going, too! No, you're not, Gene. It's a school night. This is my school now, Mom, the School of Hard Dads! So just call me Li'l Hard Dad! Yeah! But, no, not that. But, yes, he should come! If Gene wants to learn to be a man of action, this is taking action! Okay. Bye. Come on, Gene. Let's go get our refund! Refund road trip! I forgot my keys! Yeah, he did! Deal with it! Deal with it! Yeah! Look at us, just a boy and his dad, driving to get a refund. Ooh, I got chills just saying it. Well, Gene, it's Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't talk yet. I want to sample what you say and play it over and over until I've got heroic instincts coming out of every orifice of my body. Okay. Uh, it's not about being a hero, Gene. It's about doing what's right. Papa, do preach! And it is our duty, to mankind, really, to fight for justice. Some people say you have to learn to let things go. Well, you know what happens when you let things go? What?! What happens?! You drop the thing you're holding, Gene. And the thing I'm holding in this situation is this bag of crap. Nice! Listen to this. It's about doing what's right. Wow, I sound important. Powerful. Maybe take out the fart noise? No. It kind of makes you go, like, ""Huh, good point"" and also, ""Good fart."" Mom, Mom, look what I drew. It's me when I'm grown up, eating tacos with my monkey Sheila. Great, honey. Yeah. How's the reading coming, Tina? Oh, good. Really, really, really good. Good. Okay, fine! It's going terrible! I'm a slow reader! And then I get to a comma and I'm like, ""Oh, I guess ""they want me to pause, but for how long? How do I know when to stop pausing?!"" I'm never gonna finish this book! Ah! And I'm gonna have to stand up there with the whole class staring at me and my armpits are gonna sweat and my boobs are gonna sweat and all the sweat's gonna meet in the middle and everyone's gonna know I didn't read the book! Thank you. Tina, Tina, honey, listen. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, mm-kay? I didn't read any of the books I did reports on in school. What? Oh, yeah, I've never read the book. Louise! What? You never read the book. Well, I mean, you should read the book. It's-it's better to read the book. We never read the book. How can you do a book report if you haven't read the book? You just got to give 'em a little show. Pizzazz 'em so they don't even notice that you didn't you-know-what. Pizzazz, that's up my alley. I once did a presentation on Catcher in the Rye with only a catcher's mask and a loaf of rye bread. Now, that one I failed, 'cause I didn't back-cover it. Back-cover it? Oh, my God, Mom, Let me slap her again. No, it's okay. Don't slap her again. Tina's learning. See, Tina, you can't judge a book by its cover, but you can judge it by its back cover. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh Wait, I don't get it. All right, let me see. Let me see here. Dog named Buck, stolen from his home, forced to live as a sled dog in the cold, unforgiving Klondike region. Oh, my gosh, I'm getting so many ideas already! Musical numbers, choreography Musical numbers? Louise, you're on props and costumes! I'm on lyrics and dance steps! Tina, go wash your face! We got a show to do! S. Felds. This is it. - Let's give him hell! - Hello? Sheldon? It's Bob. Go away. Okay, bye. No, Gene, come back. Right, right. Li'l Hard Dad. We're not leaving, Sheldon. Not until we get our money back for this defective helicopter! So do the right thing and give us a refund. Well put. Yep. You don't get it, do you, Bob? Sheldon Felds doesn't give refunds to heliflopters who crash on their first flight. Stop calling me a heliflopter! We don't care how fun it is to say! You see, I only sell those novelty toys to make ends meet. My real passion is customizing serious RC choppers. Well, what is that? This is my quad. I've made a few modifications for poking purposes. That's dumb. Poke! Hey! Ah! Tickle, tickle. Tap, tap. Missed me! Stop-stop that. Ah! Ah! Hey, there's something on your shirt. What? Oop, got your nose! Quit it! Ah! So, shall I continue to masterfully poke you, or do you want to run along home? The latter! Good day, sir! No, we're not going anywhere. Okay then! Suit yourself, Bob! Wet Willy! Ah! How is that wet?! Oh, she looks great. You look great, hon. Maybe the best she's ever looked. Give us a twirl. See that tail? Real construction paper. Stunning. Thank you. Wag it a little honey, will you? Wag it, wag it. Shake it, shake it. That a girl. All right, so let the Call of the Wild book report rehearsal begin! Tina, here's the lyrics for the opening number. Go ahead and sing it! Go on, girl. Okay. Ring, ring.  Who's this calling on the phone?   It's the Wild, is anybody home?  Great lyrics, Mom. I know. But you got to belt it, honey. Let your voice do the reading that your eyes didn't do. That makes total sense. Uh-huh. So can you do it with vibrato? Like this?  Wild, wild!   Wild  No, that's n Okay. You know what, try grabbing the skin on your throat and moving it around while you sing like this.  Na  Like this?  Uh  No. Let me try, let me try. Gentle! Gentle! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Maybe I should just transfer to St. Mathews. What? You think those nuns won't make you do book reports? People never stop making you read books, Tina. It's a sick world! You got to learn how to faux-dazzle it. Trust me. After tonight, you won't ever have to read a book again. I love you, Mom. So, Gene, I know it seems like we're hiding from Sheldon's helicopter in a Dumpster Very much so. but we're actually just r-regrouping. And now I will calmly check outside Oh, thank God. It's gone. I mean, regroup over. Uh, we can get out now. We don't have to get out on my account. I'm in my element. No, we are going to show Sheldon that we're still here and we'll never give up! Whoa. Whoa. What's that? Fish in the sky! This was in Revelations! Kirk Cameron was right! You done hiding, Bob?! We're not hiding, Sheldon! We were regrouping! And we still want our refund! Uh-huh. Swim, my pets. Swim! Your gently floating fish don't scare me, Sheldon! They're actually kind of pretty! It's a lot like snorkeling, which I've never done, but I imagine I would love it! Ow. Ow. Dad! You're shooting BBs at me! Ow! That one hit me in the nipple! That's his good nipple! My good nipple is bleeding! Are we done here, Bob?! You lose, I win! Also, I have a couple frozen pizzas in the oven, so I'm ready to wrap this up. No! We're not done! We're not? No! Two can play the game of having a helicopter that shoots stuff, Gene! Two can play! Wow, you sound really tough, even though you're holding your nipples. This is war, Sheldon! Welcome to The Hobby Hole. I'm Terry, how can I help you? Hi, uh, weird question. Do you by any chance have any RC helicopters capable of actual warfare? Uh, we don't have anything like that, sir. Follow me. Welcome to the world of RC helicopter warfare. Whoa. I was hoping that would get a ""whoa."" We have to be pretty discreet about our warfare showroom, as you can imagine, but neat-o, huh? ""Sky-sassin""? That sounds brutal. War is brutal. Of course, we advise you absolutely do not aim these at people. Unless you hate them. Oh. Now, I need to know what kind of element we're dealing with here. Well, it's this guy who sold me a helicopter online, Sheldon Felds Oh. What? Oh, man. What is it, Terry? Just stay away from Sheldon Felds. Wait, you know him? He used to work here. He was fired. Why? Let's just say Sheldon ate a lot of food out of the fridge in the break room that didn't belong to him and was clearly labeled. And when me and the rest of the Hobby Hole guys decided to gently approach him about it, he attacked us with helicopters. Hmm. You see this? One of Sheldon's BBs got lodged in there. And now I no longer feel comfortable wearing shorts. No! Trust me. You don't want to go up against Sheldon. Well, I am going up against Sheldon. He's on a whole other level. But I've got rightness on my side. Oh, you've got rightness on your side. Okay, then you're good. Really? You think so? No, but I just realized why am I trying to stop you? I make commission on these. So let's get you all set up. Behold the Vanquisher. Whoa. Yeah, she's expensive. How expensive? $300. That's not much. But with that missile range, she's worth it. $300?! Of money? It's not about the money, Gene, it's about the principle. Yeah, it's about the principle. Terry, please. Teach me how to fly it. Huh, it's actually pretty, uh, intuitive. Yep, I probably don't need to be holding you like this. No, it helped. You know, before I let you go good luck out there, buddy. Thanks. Okay, well, thanks for coming in. There you go. Mama's old tap shoes. How do they feel? A little loose, but, um, why am I wearing these? Because nothing's more distracting than tap dancing. When your toes are tapping, they think the reading must have happened. Now, follow me! And a tap and a tap and a tap-tap-tap. And a tap and a tap and a And we're tapping and we're spinning and we're spinning and we're tapping. Hold on. So when And a shimmy tap, a shimmy tap. Wait, hold on. We're still spinning A scooby tap, a scooby tap. Scoo-Scooby tap. A wiggle tap, a jiggle tap. Wait. What? And a shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba. Scooba-dooba-doo, and no one's even looking at you, what you didn't do, and a-scabba-dooba-scabba-dooba, scabba-dooba-day. Huh? And the book report's over, and you got yourself an ""A""! Ah, maybe B-minus, probably, in my experience, you know. Hey. How's the tappin'? Great! She's like a jazzy jackhammer! Watch out, floor! Oh, yeah. So, I borrowed Teddy's wheelbarrow, and I made it look like a dogsled, and the only thing is, he said he wants to be in your book report, so I told him I'd pull some strings, get him a small part, and anyway, he's gonna meet you at school tomorrow, you can work it out then, okay? Cool? Is that cool? Very cool! You could tap with a wheelbarrow tied around you, right, hon? Uh Got to get up higher somehow, so I can see onto his stupid balcony. Oh! I'll just climb up on that roof! Uh sure, that seems like a good idea of something dangerous to do. Gene, you stay down there. Yup, no problem. Ugh! You're back. Yeah, I'm back, and I'm armed with righteousness and this! The Vanquisher. I see. Yeah, go inside, Sheldon to get your checkbook! Like her? I call her the Vanquisherer. I got it from The Hobby Hole. And then I added the extra ""er"" when I customized the crap out of it. Vanquisherer? That's hard to say. No, it's not. You just slow down on the second ""er."" Vanquisher-rer? Look, the point is, it vanquishes Vanquishers! Well, not if I vanquish it first! Are you suggesting an air battle? Perfect! Air battle! I'm gonna make your precious helicopter look like the piece of crap True Lies one you sold me! But first, can I shoot you with a missile in your nipple? I was really excited about it. Let me think. No. Air battle. All right, fine! On three. One Not to interrupt, but is this the best way to solve this? Just asking. Yes! Yes. Two. Aah, aah, aah. Three! I'm taking you down, Sheldon! You're gonna regret the day you Oh, my God, you just hit me. That was quick. Time for the death blow! Not the death blow! Huh? What? Terry?! Me and the Hobby Hole boys thought you could use a little help. We did inventory and then we came right over! Join the battle, brothers! My favorite things were eating lunch and wearing shorts, Sheldon, and you took it all away! Now it's time to pay the price! I didn't eat your delicious roast beef and cheddar sandwich, Terry! But your chopper's gonna eat this! Aah. Aah! Aah! RC net attack! Aah! This one's for Jamie Lee! Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Oh, my. Whoa! No! Dad, you're on a ledge! Yeah, but we won the air battle! Yeah! How's Sheldon's expression, Gene? Is he sad? Is he crying? No, he's eating something, and he's got a new helicopter, and it's pointing at you. Ow! And there's a dart in your butt. Father! Everything's fine, Gene. I've got everything under control. Ow! Gotcha! Are you sure?! Yup. Ow! My butt! Hoo! Uh, Bob, should we get you a ladder or something? No, Terry! Take down Sheldon! Hobby Hole Boys, give him everything you got! What? Wait, Dad! What about the ladder?! That seems like a pretty good idea. I mean, you're on a ledge, and you've got a butt full of darts! Yes, but I also have a butt full of principles! Oh! So, yeah, you guys defeat Sheldon, and I'll just work on my upper-body strength, do some pull-ups, and I'll be out of here in no time. I can't do even one! You're incredible, Bob. Time for the Sky-sassin. Luckily, I have my Sky-sassin-assin! I'll go get it. Well, I'll wait for you. What is wrong with you hobbyists?!  Up here in the Klondike, it can get pretty cold   The other dogs are looking fierce   So it's time to get bold   But when life gets tough, well, you just got to smile   And better answer that phone   'Cause it's the call of the wild!  Yes! That moved me. So, yeah, you just do that. And no one will even know you didn't read it. Or I could just do it. Yeah, no, no, you should do it. You should do it. It's your thing. You do it. Right, right, right. Uh Aah, aah! I can't! I can't do it! Aah! Aah! Aah! No, no, no, you'll be fine. Oh, yeah. You just remember all the steps. You got those. Memorize all the lyrics. Done. And don't mess it up. Boom. Uh! Okay! I'm-I'm gonna go to bed. Uh. Everything's gonna be fine. Okay. Uh. Good night! Yeah, get your beauty sleep. Oh, your wheelbarrow, hon. You might want to Aah! Ah, she's fine. She's got this. We did good today, Mom. We did good. We did. Yeah. Hey, you want me to teach you how to get out of a speeding ticket? Yes! Sky-sassin! Destroy him, Terry, and I didn't catch all of your names, but you guys destroy him, too! Oh, that's Vance, and that's Will. Hi. Hey. Hey, Dad, remember this? Some people say you have to learn to let things go. I know you don't agree with them, but I'm starting to think maybe some people are right. Listen, here it is high-pitched like a little girl. Some people say you have to learn to let things go. Here it is super, super deep, like a monster. You have to learn to let things go. Here it is with a beat under it. You have to learn to let things go. No matter how I play it back, Keyboard Dad sounds a lot smarter than Hanging from the Building Dad! I like the one with the beat. I came here today 'cause I thought I needed to learn to be a heroic man of action. But look at you. You're all nuts! Is anything worth all of this? I mean, Terry, I'm sorry you can't wear shorts. I would be devastated myself, but still! Also, just go to a doctor! Maybe sometimes the more heroic thing is to just let it the freak go! Now, who's gonna be the bigger man here, and just let it go?! I-I don't need a refund. I'll give you your refund. No, I said it first. I said it first! I'm the bigger man. No, I am! Sheldon, I'm sorry we ganged up on you about the food thing! I'm sorry I ganged up on all your food! Well, I forgive you! Thank you. Can I have my job back? No, you can't. It's not up to me. Remember Roger? He's in charge of it now. Can you believe it? Can someone just get a ladder already?! You know, Gene, in your own way, you kind of ended up saving the day today. Oh, thank God you finally said it. The whole car ride, I was, like, ""Do I say it? No, he should be the one to say it. I'm not gonna say it."" Well, I'm saying it, so, thanks. Huh. Today started with me wanting to learn from you, but then you learned from me. Does that make me your dad now? No. Do you want to switch for a while? I could take Mondays. Let's keep it like this for now. Well, you're still my hero, Dad. You're mine, too, Gene. Now how about we go inside and ice my butt? I wonder how many other dads are saying that to their sons right now. I bet a lot. And that's why it truly was like a tale of two cities. But I feel like maybe next time, focus on the tale of just one city. And maybe that city is like a yogurt shop where cool teens work. I want to work there. Thank you. Okay, Jocelyn. Tina, you're up. Hi. Hi. Hi, everyone. Uh. Good job, Jocelyn. Thank you. Ring, ring, ring. What did she just say? It's the call of the wild? Aah! I can't take it! I can't take it! Wow. Tina. That was, uh Did you all see that? That was Um, I I'm-I'm sorry. amazing. Oh. You just embodied all the themes of the book. Huh. The primitivism, Buck's return to his savage nature. Yeah. The sweating. Great job. She was really good. That was really good. Well, I definitely read the book, Huh. She changed some things, but, uh, she still nailed it. She totally nailed it. So say it, Bob. No. Say it. You win best parent of the week. Yes! Yes! Me! I thought I won best parent of the week! Wait. How did you kids get out of class? Hey, don't worry about it. Did I miss it? Tina! Did I miss it? And a shimmy tap, a shimmy tap. A scooby tap, a scooby tap. A shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba, scooba-dooba-do, and no one's even looking at you, what you didn't do. And a-scabba-dooba-scabba-doo. Wiggle tap and jiggle tap. A shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba, scooba-dooba-do, and no one's even looking at you, what you didn't do. And a-scabba-dooba, scabba-dooba, scabba-dooba-day. The book report's over, and you got yourself an ""A""! Ah, maybe B-minus, probably, in my experience. Shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba"
"TEDDY: Friday! So, any big weekend plans?  Date night tonight   Gonna go out, get some food   Have a few drinks   Forget we have kids for a little bit   La, yeah.  What's the plan? I couldn't tell you if I wanted to. Only Bobby knows. He planned the whole thing. Yup. There will be dinner, drinks and entertainment. Ooh! The big three! Ha-cha-cha-cha! (door opens) And we're home. Whoa, what's that? The class pet. I'm taking care of it this weekend. You're fine with it. I'm not. The permission slip I signed for you says you're fine with it. You're into it. (sneezes) Ugh, what's wrong with it? Weird fur, seizures, runny nose, runny eyes, runny everything. Everybody's got their something. There wasn't anyone else who wanted to take it? Just Wayne. Who's Wayne? Kid in my class. We had a tiny disagreement about who should take the chinchilla home this weekend. No! No! No! No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Well, congratulations, I guess. Just, um, keep it out of our room. Yeah, yeah, okay, Dad. Aw, was your little friend Wayne upset? Ah, no. He was easy breezy. Ah! Remember, bedtime is 7:00, not too much TV, no sugary snacks, and pet with the grain. Pet with the grain! Okay, don't forget. Your father and I are going out tonight, so you're gonna babysit, Tina, right? About that. Um I was talking to some other girls, and did you know some people get paid to babysit? Oh, boy, she's onto us. Okay, let's start the negotiation. A thousand dollars and a parking space. How about three dollars an hour? Okay, deal. Three dollars every hour? Whoa, whoa, whoa. We get a cut of this, right, Tina? Okay. But you all got to be in bed by the time we get home, or nobody sees a dime. No problem we can go to bed in our sleep. (singsongy): Ooh, Bobby! I'm excited to see where you're taking me. Lin, you don't have to cover your eyes. I never asked you to do that. I just want a big surprise. And surprises are better when you're blind. Well, take a look. We're here! Huh? ""Stoolz."" It gets better. Bing-a-ding, bing-a-ding- ding-ding-ding, brainiacs! This is your trivia master Dave letting you know that we are less than one minute away from trivia night! Trivia night? Ugh. When does it get better, Bob? Well, that was supposed to be the part where it got better. Y-You love trivia. I do? We played bar trivia that one time years ago. Remember? Yeah? We had fun. We did? I thought we did. We had a funny team name. We were Albert Beerstein. That's funny? Yes, it's funny! It works on many levels, Lin! But, look, we can go somewhere else if you want to. No, let's just get through date night. Right. Okay. Mm-hmm, great. Fine. Yup, get a drink. Yeah. Okay, trivia-meisters. Round one, question one. When I was 14, I had a crush especial on Puerto Rican actress Rosie Perez. Oh, we got this. It's gonna be White Men Can't Jump. In what year did the United States annex Puerto Rico? Oh. Um, it's, um um You know what? The first question's always the hardest. All right, now that we got the easy one out of the way Oh, crap. I mean, this will be fun. Yeah, it's fun, it's fun. It's like homework, but-but fun homework. How many rounds are there? Not-not many, but many. TINA: I just want you guys to know that even though I'm your paid babysitter tonight, I'm still your sister. But I'm getting paid. No feet on the couch. But I'm still your sister. For now. Until I get married off. All right, so, when you're with me, you're not called Princess Little Piddles. You are Shinobu. You like it? I know, it's great. This is Kuchi Kopi. You're both little troublemakers. You're both huge in Japan. You probably have a lot to talk about go! Keep things light. Don't bring up your divorce. Or Nixon. Or Radiohead. (phone ringing) Belcher residence. Both my parents are home tonight and they're black belts. Uh, it's for you, Louise. Really? Hello? Hey, Louise. Wayne here. Uh, so how's Princess Little Piddles? Fine. Great talk. Bye-bye. Wait! Put Princess on the phone. What? Put Princess Little Piddles on the phone! Why? Princess Little Piddles! Can you hear my voice?! Are you okay?! (groans) Bye. (doorbell rings) I'll get it since I'm in charge. While I'm gone, Gene's in charge. Louise, if Gene can't handle his duties, it's all you, sister. I can handle my doodies, thank you! (panting) I couldn't stop him! He barreled right past me like a really fast barrel! Oh, my God, Wayne, you were calling from outside my house? (shrieks, gasps) Out of cage! Out of cage! Okay, you're acting nuts, Wayne. Oh, you mean nuts for responsibility?! Like nut, crazy, bad, rotten nut! Responsible handsome head nuts maybe?! No, no way! Just nuts! No, handsome nuts! I know nuts! No, like cashews! Um, excuse me! I hate to interrupt a productive dialog, but where'd the chinchilla go? (shrieks) Uh, he's around here somewhere. (screams) Stop screaming and help me look, Wayne! Why is the front door open? Maybe God closed a window? EDITH: Chinchilla! Disgusting! Oh, no, no, no, no! Hey, mama! There he is! (squeaking) Oh. Hey, little, guy. It's Jonas. GENE: Oh, good, he's bringing him back. Jonas! Hey! You found our chinchilla! Thank you! What? I can't hear you! Bye! No! No! No! No! Wait! Wait! Wait! No! Oh, my God! What just happened?! It ran away and joined the worst biker gang in the world. Oh, Princess Little Piddles has been abducted! This is all your fault, Louise! What?! This is your fault, Wayne! You barged in to my house and left the door open! I was barging! Bargers are not responsible for closing the door! It's not a disaster. Jonas is the delivery boy at Reggie's Deli. We'll just go to Reggie's. We shouldn't be out! We should be back home! I'm not certified for outdoor child care! Tina, we're under your care, but this chinchilla is under my care, which technically falls under your jurisdiction. Right? I guess that's true. Or it might not make any sense at all Well, we'll be back home in 20 minutes. All right, let's go to Reggie's. Aw, crap! Reggie's is closed. Oh, now what?! We smash Reggie's window and make some sandwiches and go from there. No, we go to where Reggie lives, and we ask him where Jonas lives. You want to know where Jonas lives? Well, take a number. Just kidding. Deli humor. Quit pussyfooting around! The address, Reggie! Uh, Jonas is at his friend Clay's house doing homework. Clay is at Jonas's house doing homework. What the? Isn't he? How can they both be at each other's houses? Maybe they broke the space-time continuum. Must've been some homework. Unless it's an excuse teenagers tell their parents when they don't want them to know where they're going. But where would that be? A secret teen event of secrecy? You mean a party? Yes! Tina, thank you! Is that Teddy?  I   Wish my radio worked.  Oh, no! If Teddy sees us out of the house, he'll tell Mom and Dad. Everyone hide! (gasps) Huh? Oh, geez. Thought I saw Harvey. Ah, that was close. Listen. Why don't we go home, make a decoy chinchilla out of pipe cleaners and socks to buy ourselves some time? No, Tina, we're looking for a party. What do you know about high school parties? Nothing, but I might know someone who might know something. (doorbell rings) (groans) What do you maxi-sads want? DAVE: Okay, after round one, in first place are the DILFs. In second place, Old Kevin. And in last place, with no correct answers, are the Date Nights of the Round Table. (whoops) Hey! First couple ever here on a date! I guess the romance doesn't revolve around knowing things, because they don't. (laughs) Hey, hey! Easy, Mr. Questions! Just kidding, just kidding. (whispering): I'm not kidding. They can't hear me. They don't know anything. Oh, my God, we're losing. And now we're getting heckled. I guess we can just go home. All right, let's get out of here. Let me just go to the bathroom. Round two, question one. Hiking is stupid. How many miles long is the Appalachian Trail? I was hoping there'd be more questions about '80s TV shows. (quietly): Bob, I did something bad. In the bathroom? No! Look! I stole an answer sheet from Dave's folder! We got all the answers! What?! Lin, are you crazy? We can't cheat. Oh, yeah, we don't want to cheat against Dave. He's such a good guy. Uh Write down the answer, Bob. Write it down! Okay, okay. Not like that, like you just thought of it. You look at the ceiling, you say, ""Hmm,"" and then you look down. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. That's it, that's it. I might be able to find out which high school party this Jonas kid is at, but why would I want to help a bunch of babies get their cat back? It's not a cat, it's a chinchilla! Anything that's not a dog is a cat to me. We'll owe you. You name it. Anything, anytime. What if I want Tina to kiss a dirty flip-flop at 3:00 a.m. on a Tuesday? Let's not go crazy Of course. Yes. That. No, no, no. I'm gonna think of something good to make Tina do later when I'm feeling really bad about myself. But we've got a deal. Whoa, that's a lot of technology. We get it. You have e-mail. (groans) I'm using social media to triangulate Jonas's whereabouts. Look. Jonas is friends with David Schnabel, who just tweeted at Vanessa Jackson ""See you at Casey's party."" And according to Leilani LeFelt's secret blog she thinks no one knows about, Jonas has a huge crush on Vanessa. So that means Jonas is at Casey's party. Voila. All right, troops, wheels up, we're flying! I-I don't think we can go to a high school party, Louise. Mom and Dad will kill me. There'll be high school boys there. Right. Maybe we can just do a quick pop-in. Oh, wait, you think you're gonna get into that party? Oh, you are never gonna get in. I wouldn't even get in, and I'm the hottest girl in eighth grade. You're in eighth grade? I thought you were someone's mom. Trust me, Tammy. Getting in is gonna be the easy part. I've gotten into the teacher's lounge so many times I have my own coffee mug there. It says ""I Hate Mondays."" Classic. Mm I'm cashing in my favor. If you can get me into that party, we're even. Let's go! Every minute of our life is five minutes of a chinchilla's life! Aha! Here's our ticket into this poop show. How is trash gonna help us? Oh, Wayne. Watch and learn. (doorbell rings) Well, someone did. What? Did you say, ""We didn't order any pizza""? No. Well, someone did. And old man pizza boss is gonna have my ass if I don't deliver it. Where's the bathroom? Uh, down that way. Thanks. I'll be out of there in 30 minutes or less. Hang on, Atlas. We're coming, buddy. Who's Atlas? (sighs) It's my secret name for Princess Little Piddles. Really? Huh. I call him Shinobu. Princess Little Piddles it just isn't right. I know. Fourth graders shouldn't be in charge of names. Or sex determination. He has testicles for God's sake! I know! I told them, ""Guys, those are testicles!"" No one believed me! Everyone thought they were butt boobs! (grunts) I can't believe that worked. Whew! Well done, Gene. Aw are you going to the bathroom? Um no? Oh, my God! Oh, a high school party is no place for a small animal! They're probably playing Spin the Chinchilla with him right now! Uh, let's just focus here. If you were a teenager with a chinchilla, where would you be? Chinchilla-con. So this is our first high school party. Let's savor this moment. High school boys' butts are higher up, I'm noticing. Okay, incoming teen dream, two o'clock if I'm using that term correctly, which I don't know, because I actually can't tell time on those round clocks. Ring the flirt alarm, here I go. Yeah, it's just like ding-dong, ring-a-ding, let this rip. Hey, what grade are you guys in? (moans) (babbles) Forget it. Bye. I can't feel my arms! I can't move! Oh, God, he was taller than my dad! Oh, God, another one's coming! (panting) (babbling) On the Internet, you can be whoever you want, and no one will ever know. Where does the word ""modem"" come from? (whispering): Should we get this one wrong? Just to not look suspicious? No. We know this one. We don't know it we're cheating. Well, now we know it, and we're not getting it wrong. Okay. (loudly): You know the answer, DILFs? Old Kevin? Because we do. (imitates modem) Lin. What is that? What? It's a modem. I'm making modem noises at them. It-it's more like this. (imitates modem) (both imitating modems) Okay, good modem noises, Date Nights of the Round Table. Now back to the questions. (both imitating modems) DAVE: Okay, okay! Tina. I have to fart. What? It's a fear fart. I (grunts) I can't hold it. Tammy, no! You can't fart at a high school party. I know that! Don't you think I know that?! Okay, I'm gonna fix this, honey. Can you hold it real tight until I get you to a window? I'm gonna pick you up now. (both grunt) Gentle. Don't squeeze. (both grunt) Excuse us. Coming through. Just a couple of normal teenagers partying. Hi. How are you? How are you doing? Go, go. (farts) (sighs) Tina, you literally just saved my life. I am not gonna forget this until the day I die. That's so Oh, my God, this girl farted! Right here, over here! What? I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Nobody's listening to us. Jonas bingo. Whoa. Knock-knock. Who's there? Uh, you guys. You guys who? That's right, you're not supposed to be here. Give us the chinchilla, Jonas. It's ours. It's the fourth-grade class pet, for crying out loud. What? Oh, well, sorry, I didn't know that. I thought he was a gremlin, and I was like, ""What? Gremlins are real?"" Anyway, I gave him to Vanessa. What?! What?! Where's Vanessa? She took it, went off with some of her friends, and they were like, ""Girls only, except these three guys."" (chuckles) Where did they go? I don't know. They were talking about going roller-skating. Wherever you do that. The roller rink, maybe? Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm gonna slap you. What? Ow, my moneymaker! Here, let me see that for a second. Ow! Oh, you found Jonas. Hi, Jonas. Hey you, girl. Whew, I was afraid you wouldn't remember me. Does this mean we got the chinchilla back? Because Mom and Dad could be home any minute. No. Jonas gave him away, and now he's at a roller rink. (groans) Jonas, what does Vanessa look like? I don't know. She has hair and pants. Great description you should work for the FBI. Listen, you're coming with us to point out who she is. Why would I do that? You guys belong together. You have the thing, she has her thing. Yeah, it's the opposite of ""opposites attract."" This is Jonas time. This is what you've been training for. You got to go with us. Oh, my God. Let's go! I'm coming, Shinobu. I'm coming, Atlas. I'm coming, roller rink snack bar hot dogs! All right, there's the rink. Let's go get our chinchilla. Oh, God, you don't think they have strobe lights in there, do you? Probably. Why? Strobe lights give him seizures. Oh, right, the strobe light incident. Why did Alfonz bring a strobe light to show and tell? WAYNE: Ugh, 'cause his grandfather invented it. Oh, my God, is that Teddy again? Ugh, pad thai is not good driving food. Uh, everyone freeze! Huh? Why are we freezing? If we don't move, he can't see us. Is that true? Maybe. Hold your breath! Oh, shoot, I just remembered I'm allergic to peanuts. (hacks) I'll be all right. I'll be all right. (hacks) Oh, my God, it worked. Tina's a wizard. Do something else. Make a jean jacket appear on me. Jean jacket! (Dave imitates air horn) It's time for the final round. And incredibly, the seemingly dimwitted Date Nighters have rocketed into first place. Yeah, Date Nighters! We're smart, and cute! Cuter than the DILFs! (booing) Yeah. All right, okay, settle down. Question one: I've never been a carpenter or on a boat, but Kurt Russell did both in what 1987 movie? (whispering): Lin, where's the answer sheet? Uh (gasps) Oh, no, it fell. Oh, God, get it, Lin. You're closer. Shh, I got it, I got it. (loudly): Oops, I dropped some hummus. Hello, just getting that hummus there. Okay. We love hummus. Hey, what's that? What? That's an answer sheet. Nah. Uh, yeah, definitely. No. No, no. You were cheating, you're cheating. Cheaters! No one's cheating. No. Total cheaters! Full-on cheaters! Okay, you know what? We were cheating. I took my wife here on date. We have about three of these a year. In a good year. And I brought her to bar trivia. I screwed up. And you didn't help, Dave. You made us feel stupid, just because we didn't know the answers to any of the questions. I know that was fun for Kevin. (laughs) I know, I know. But my wife found a way to make this date night fun, and, damn it, I'm not sorry about that. So sweet. You're out of here! Deborah! No, it Hands off, Deborah. Hey! Ow! (grunts) Wow, I'm sorry, Lin. That was, uh worth it. (whoops) Hot one. Next date night, let's cheat at karaoke. LOUISE: All right, Jonas, where's Vanessa? Where's my chinchilla? WAYNE: Our chinchilla. Okay, Vanessa, love of my life. Let's see. There she is! Let's go, let's go! Time to roll my way into Vanessa's heart. Vanessa, where's the chinchilla? What? Princess Little Piddles! What's ""Piddles""? He's our class pet. Oh, I'm sorry, little kids, but that security guard offered me 40 bucks for it. Oh, my God! How could you? It was easy. He was like, ""Here's $40."" And I was like, ""Here you go."" (groans) Come on! Oh, Vanessa, that kid Jonas likes you, and you should give him a chance. Or not. Your call. What? I can't hear you. The music's too loud. I got to skate. Hey, Vanessa! Wait for me! Hey, sir? Yeah. Can you push me towards that girl over there? All right. (grunts) He touched my butt. Excuse me, hi. That thing you paid $40 for, it's ours. You guys smoke weed? No, the chinchilla you paid $40 for. What? No, no, no. That's gonna be a present for my landlord. I'm a little short on rent this month. Why didn't you give him the $40? Hey, you're a smart kid. Where were you five minutes ago? Over there. Sorry, buddy, but the chinchilla already belongs to Miss Labonz's fourth-grade class. (sighs) I guess I have to do the right thing. You have 40 bucks? We can write you a check. Do you have a check? I do. Uh-oh. What? Okay, if you were a chinchilla, and you were a rascally little son of a bitch that wouldn't stay in a box, where would you be? No! Damn it! Here, Shinobu. Here, thingy. Atlas, Atlas. Here, thingy, thingy. Javier. Shinobu. Where are you? Oh, wait, is that him? Or is that a loose furry skate? Ah! He's gonna get killed out there! Look out, coming through! Move it, people, move it! (whip cracks) Huh? ANNOUNCER: You know what that means. Time for The Whip! (whip cracks) (gasps) Hang on, Shinobu! I'll protect you, Atlas! You okay? I'm okay. (vomits) (groans) Let's get out of here, quick. Go, go, go! Uh-oh, we have a vomit situation. Look out, skaters, the floor gets slippery when wet. (gasps) Vanessa! (thud) No! VANESSA: Oh, gross! Oh, God. I like her less now. TINA: Please let Mom and Dad not be home. Please let Mom and Dad not be home. Please let Mom and Dad not be home. Mom? Dad? Oh, thank God, they're not home. Well, Wayne, we did it. Yeah, we did. You were great out there on the rink. You came through, big-time. You, too. So I'll hold Atlas while you go collect his things. Oh, my God, after all we just went through to get him back, you're still acting like this? You still want to take him home? Don't forget his water bottle. And, hurry, 'cause if he's gonna get a story tonight, I have to get him home soon. You know what, why don't we just let him choose who he wants to stay with? (scoffs) I've cared for him every weekend for a year, so I think I know who he's gonna pick. Perfect. You stand there, I'll stand here, Put him down in the middle, Tina. Okay. Come to Wayne, Atlas. Come here. Shinobu. (kissing) Come on, come to Wayne. Come here, baby. Come on, Atlas. Atlas. Come here, come, come, come. Ah, yes! Take that, Wayne. He loves me, not you. He's sick of your boring rules! Okay, he's made his choice. Well, I guess I'll get going. Uh have a good weekend. Uh, don't you want to say good-bye to Shinobu? Oh, no, I'll I'll see you Monday. That didn't feel as great as I thought it would. I mean, it still feels great, but just not as great. My theory is that Wayne is really sad because you made him think the chinchilla doesn't love him. Why don't we all go get in bed really fast, and think about whether Gene is right. Go, go, go! Hi. Why did some kid just run out of here crying? There's always kids running out of here crying. What are you still doing up? Oh, hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. We weren't out or anything. We were home all night. Okay. You saying that makes me think you maybe Hey, you know what, this one's on me. You don't even have to pay me. High school party? What? (chuckles) W-Wait, hold on a second. What's wrong with Louise? Louise, honey, you okay? I think I need a ride somewhere. Mm no. What are you doing here? Hey, so after you left, Shinobu seemed real down and kind of off. He wasn't sneezing or anything, like, not a single seizure. Really? Oh. Anyway, I guess maybe he missed you. He did? I just don't think he's gonna be happy at our place. Plus, my dad's simple and doesn't know his own strength. Oh, I can see that. I mean, your dad looks like he'd sit on anything. Oh, he has. I'm right here. So you better just take him. I don't think he even likes me. (whispers): Stop it, play along. Tell me how it goes on Monday, will you? Okay, thanks, bye. Bye. That was nice, Louise. That was really, really sweet. Ugh, I know. You know, me and your mom cheated at trivia tonight. Really? Yup. Impressed? What's wrong with you? You took her to trivia? Sounds like you cheated Mom out of a date. There's my girl. LINDA:  Date night tonight   Gonna go out, get some food   Have a few drinks, forget we have kids for a little bit   La, yeah   Date night tonight, yeah   Gonna go out, get some food   Have a few drinks, forget we have kids for a little bit   Gonna go out, get some food   Have a few drinks, forget we have kids for a little bit   La, yeah   It's just what we do   Date night, date night, date night   Gonna go out"
"I can't believe we're at school on a Saturday. The Cotton Candy Festival is today at Wonder Wharf! I heard they have unusual and exotic flavors. Like lasagna. And chimichurri! Well, you'll never know since you'll all be in detention. Dad, Tina will give you all the money in her bank account if you take us to Wonder Wharf right now. Please? By the time we get out of detention, the festival will be over. Well, you should've thought about that before you got in trouble. Good kids eat cotton, bad kids eat notton'. I can't believe you won't go to detention for me. I already told you, if I could I would, but I can't fit into your clothes, Tammy. You know I want to. You want to go to detention for me or you want to wear my clothes? J-Just go. Mom, I can't believe I got detention. Don't even worry about it. You're, like, really pretty. All day, huh? Oof, this is gonna suck for you, really. Hey, there's Bob. Hey, Belcher! You got three kids in detention, huh? Yeah, Jimmy. I only got one. I win! Well, I had none in detention yesterday! How many did you have in Don't roll up your window! Roll it back down! Well? Do any of you have anything to say for yourselves after what happened yesterday at school? I have something to say. I'd like to apologize on behalf of Tammy. She's a horrible person who caused all of this, and everyone should be released from this hell pit except her. Thank you. You're a liar without a hair dryer. This is your sister's fault! I'm a boy! Not you, Gene. Tina. She caused all of this. If by ""caused"" you mean ""didn't cause,"" then, yeah, I caused this. High five. Sure. Ow. Too hard. From what I remember, this was caused by one thing and one thing only: fashion. Okay, so this is it. Day one with my new look. I can't believe I'm wearing this at school. I barely recognize you. Maybe I shouldn't do it. No, no. If you want to dazzle, you got to take razzles. That's a dazzling way to say ""risks."" You take fashion risks with your fashion wrists. Hi, how are you guys? They're speechless, Tina. They don't know what to say because they've never seen anything so original. I think you're right. Guys, this is going great. Oh, my God! Tina's wearing the same bracelet as you, Tammy! Tina, you need to take that off right now. Sparkle jelly bracelets are my thing since yesterday when I bought it. Yeah. Tammy, I understand you're disappointed. I'm a little disappointed, too. Before I saw it on you, I thought this bracelet was classy. Take it off. I would rather die. Then you will die! Get off my sister! Hey! You guys playing Red Rover? Send Zeke on over! I don't know what to do! The fire department will fix this! Yeah! Foam party! Detention! Saturday! All of you! What?! Admit it, Tina, the only reason you wore that sparkle jelly bracelet was because you wanted to copy me, okay? That's not true. I wore it because I wanted to make a statement without saying a word. Mm-Kay, well, I have a statement for you then. Darn it! Ugh! Why can't I fart when I want to? Where are the kids? They got detention, Teddy. On the day of the Cotton Candy Festival? That's rough. Wish I could go, but I can't trust myself. You think you're gonna get one, maybe two cottons, next thing you know you're getting kicked out of the festival, and they take away your car keys. Right. Hi, sweetie. Can I help you? Hi. Good afternoon. My name is Sally. I hope that you're enjoying your day. Would you like to buy some magazine subscriptions to help me learn communication skills, help me buy textbooks, and send me on a trip to Turtle Camp in Florida? I'm only 283 points away from my goal. Turtle Camp? Uh, no, thanks. We're-we're not interested. At all. Aw. I love turtles. What do you do at camp? You get in a little canoe with them? Do turtle crafts? You can select up to ten magazines from any of these titles for only $17. - That sounds like a great deal. - Fake. This is fake. Not real. I'll take a look! Fake. Let me see what you got. Jacuzzi Enthusiast. Ooh, they got Lotion Monthly. Ooh. Ooh, ooh. Aw, Healthy Babies Digest. Aw Lin, Th-they never send you the magazines. You will start receiving issues within 30 days. Uh, hold on one second, Sally. Quick conversation over here with my wife. Lin, no. They have Open-Toe Living. Linda, it's a scam. You give them money, and they just take it. Sally's a scammer? Our Sally? Somebody's scamming her, too. They put her up to it. What are we talking about over here? Somebody is scamming Sally. Bastard! We got to help her. Or we can just nicely ask her to leave. No, Bobby. We lost three kids to detention today. We're not losing Sally, too. Sally! What? Nothing, Sally! Nothing. Uh, no. Fashion has become toxic here at Wagstaff. Believe it or not, even I have been the recipient of what some people call a ""fashion thrashin'."" Wha What?! Wh-What? ""More like sweater mess""? That night, I was upset. But instead of lashing out in anger, I turned to the needle. That's right. The knitting needle. I rehabilitated myself with fashion. That's an emotional-ass story, Mr. Frond. Fashion should be a form of expression, not a weapon to tear people down. That is why I have decided to team you up and pitch you against each other in a fashion contest. So far, this all makes sense. Uh, no, thanks. If you need me, I'll be zoning out pretty hard over here. And I'm gonna sleep with my eyes open. Like this. Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine! The winning team will be allowed to leave detention three hours early. Wait, what? Seriously? We can go to the Cotton Candy Festival! Mr. Frond, you got yourself a fashion contest. Welcome to Scared Fabulous! Hey, Tina. How about a side bet? Winner gets to wear the sparkle jelly bracelet. Loser has to throw theirs in the trash. Deal. We've got a deal like Ally McBeal. We've got a deal like Steven Spiel berg. Welcome to Scared Fabulous. You will divide into teams and face three challenges. You'll sketch designs, collect materials, and construct outfits on your CPR dummy. Good news for us, 'cause that dummy looks hot in anything. Then one of you will walk your design down the runway. You will have three impartial judges with a keen sense of fashion: Ms. Schnur, Coach Blevins and Mr. Branca. What? The big three? Aren't they all supposed to be in Milan this week? They're the only other faculty members who happen to be in the building today. I'm on Tammy's team! I want to be on Zeke's team. Someday we're gonna start our own men's fashion line then live in a van! Yeah! Called Fancy Pants! You're gonna fance the way you pants. I guarantee it! Fine, then. The last team will be the Belcher kids. There are three of you, but I don't really see that as an advantage. Don't underestimate us. Our family's motto is, ""Maybe we'll get lucky this time."" I thought it was, ""Stop touching that! You're getting it all greasy!"" How's the burger, Sally? You like it? It's fine. Thanks. So, are you guys gonna buy any magazines? No, Sally, 'cause your life is a lie. What? Linda. Sorry, Sally. Uh, what my wife is trying to say is that there are no magazines. You're-you're involved in a scam. Somebody is using you. But I'm only 283 points away from reaching my goal. Sally! There are no points! What? There is no goal! But There are no turtles! Oh. You got to get out! What happened to the turtles? Linda, calm down. I guess I'm gonna get going. Uh, okay, yeah, but did you get what we were talking about here? Give me a quick hug! We'll, I'm not supposed Sally. I got to be on my way, but, uh sorry to, uh sorry to, uh sorry to, uh sorry to bother you. Bye, Sally. What a nice girl. Wait, where's my purse? My purse! Oh, there it is. There it is. Everything's okay. My fries! You ate them, Teddy. Oh, okay. Can I get another fry over here please? All right. I just got off the phone with Principal Spoors' voicemail. I feel like the message went really well, and I think what we're looking at here is a pilot program that will probably go national. So, Ms. Schnur, what is the first challenge? For my challenge, I want each team to design an outfit that I can wear over a three-day holiday weekend. All right, Schnur, what are we talking here? Martial arts tournament? Canadian pill run? Antiquing? No. I'm just gonna sit on the couch all weekend and watch a David Schwimmer movie marathon. Great! Okay, designers, time to make her fab while you rehab. Ms. Schnur wants to sit on the couch for three days. Gene, you were born to design this outfit. I'm like the Steve Jobs of sitting on the couch for three days. Tina, you can be our model. Uh, I don't know. I'm not very good at walking. You're getting better. Just keep your head high, pick your knees up, and make every step a glamorous stomp. You mean like a horse? Mm yeah.   Clip-clop, girl! I'm in. All right, designers, you each have five minutes to collect your materials. Are we going to the fabric store? No! Oh. For this challenge, you can only use materials from Ms. Schnur's supply closet. And your time starts now! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Ugh, you copied my bracelet, Tina, and now you want to take my stapler? Why don't you staple your mouth shut, 'cause your face keeps falling open and dumb words keep coming out. Mine! No! Oh, there's another one right here. Welcome to the runway. As you know in fashion, one day you're in, the next day you're rehabilitated. And out free in the world eating cotton candy to shove it in your face, the whole thing. The winner of this challenge will receive immunity in the next round. Let's start the show! J-Ju's wearing the Couch-fit! For the d For those days you just don't want to get off the couch, now you don't have to. 'Cause you are the couch. Spin. Looking good, girl! Ha. Mmm, mmm, mmm It doesn't matter if she's out on the town or in on the couch, we wanted Ms. Schnur to look fun and flirty, not gross and dirty. This is me right now. And clip-clop. Clip-clop. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you the Adult Bib. The pockets are lined with aluminum foil to keep your chicken wings warm. We got this, Gene. Tina looks great out there. Horsey but good. Ah! Oh, no! My nephew through the years! Oh, nice one, Tina. Uh, good luck winning after you ruined Ms. Schnur's family forever. Uh Now it's time to pick a winner and see who will get immunity and move directly to the final round. Zeke, Jimmy Jr., I found your look incredibly offensive. I am not a couch. Tammy, Jocelyn, your flirty outfit would send the wrong message to the Chinese food delivery guy. His name is Enrique, and he's already very forward with me. Belcher children, your model fell over and destroyed all my photographs of Nathan. Ms. Schnur, it's time to announce your decision. The winner of this challenge is Come on, Schnur. Get us to that sweet, sweet cotton candy. Tammy and Jocelyn. Yay! We're popular! Yes! Yes! Sparkle jealous, much? Blah, blah, blah much? That's you. I want cotton candy much! That's me! Kids, welcome to round two. Coach Blevins, tell the designers about their next challenge. Uh, I just came in today to pull up these old wrestling mats because they're full of, uh, blood and spit. Mm-hmm. Also, I need to throw out these jerseys. They're from the '60s, and they have high levels of bacteria. Yeah, but isn't bacteria just a myth? So let's just say the materials for this challenge will be wrestling mats and old jerseys. Now, tell them what kind of outfit you want. Well, next Saturday, I have a wrestling meet in the morning, traffic school in the afternoon and salsa dancing at night. So I guess I need an outfit that's a triple threat: coaching, getting my license back, dancing. You heard the man. Let's get started, designers. Good luck, designer-whiners! We have immunity! That means we don't have to design an outfit this round, and we can never die. Just the first thing. The second thing is incorrect. Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you? Did you tell this girl that she was part of a scam? Um, a little bit? Who are you? I'm Trish, and I've been helping girls like Sally get communication skills, textbooks and trips to Florida for the last 16 years. Oh, okay. So you're the one behind the whole fake Turtle Camp thing? Fake Turtle Camp thing? Do you know what these girls learn down there? They learn to come out of their shell. Yup. Let me tell you a story, huh? Once upon a time, there was a little girl. And she used to stutter with a lisp, like this. Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th. And then she sold magazines and went to Turtle Camp, and everything changed. Was it you? Yes. Let's say yes. These magazines change lives. Oh, my God, Bobby, it's not a scam. We had it all wrong. Uh, yeah. Still think this is a bunch of crap. It-it just seems like you're asking girls to sell magazines and then taking the money. Okay, you know what else a turtle can do? Huh? Do you know? A little turtle, what can it do, hmm? It can snap! Snapping turtles! So do you want to see me snap, hmm? No. Or do you want to buy some magazines? Calm down. What are you doing? Okay, okay, take it easy. Oh, no! Bobby, she's pulling up the counter! Do you want to buy any magazines?! Say yes, Bobby! Say yes! Oh! God, I'm going crazy! Okay, do you have any magazines about cooking? We have Cooking in the Kitchen. Great. I'll get my checkbook. Get your checkbook. Get it! I'm getting it! Hurry! I can't find it! Okay, the designs are complete. Let's tear them apart metaphorically. Coach Blevins will be sporty and spicy in this one-piece, all-day dress shirt. Mm-hmm. You'll notice the design is backless, which is perfect for salsa dancing and gettinyour license back. Come on! Zeke is wearing a traditional Japanese samurai outfit. 'Cause there is nowhere this outfit doesn't fit in and stand out. Coach Blevins, it's time to announce the winner of this challenge and who will face Tammy and Jocelyn in the final round! Uh, I honestly don't know anything about fashion. Can we just call it a tie? No, we cannot call it a tie. It's fashion. There has to be a winner and a loser. Pick one! Um, maybe they should just wrestle for it. That's how I usually settle things in my gym class. Fine, then. If that's what it takes for you to pick a winner, then we'll have them wrestle. Wait. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go! Yeah! This is my kind of fashion show! Gene, get over here! I'm gonna get ya! Come on! Come on! I just ironed this outfit! Aah! Oh, hello, Principal Spoors. We're right in the middle of a fashion show. I assume you're calling about that? It's-it's a little hard to hear you. Wh-What were you saying? Stop it! Oh, you you what Scared Fabulous? You hate it. Okay. Like, ironically? Hey, Tina! You guys are gonna lose! So bracelet in your facelet is what I'm talking about! You want to go, Tammy? Want to go?! Yeah! I'd like to talk to you more, a little more, about the Oh. Okay, right. No more calls on the weekend. Got it. Right. Bye. So, designers, I just spoke with Principal Spoors, and there have been some new developments. Scared Fabulous will abruptly end now, and we'll all be returning to class where detention will resume as usual. What?! What about the finals? And the Cotton Candy Festival! Whoa, Mr. Frond, hold on. You're gonna let Principal Spoors just shut down our rehabilitation? It was a mutual decision. Oh, I get what's going on. He didn't think you were qualified to run a fashion-based at-risk youth program. Maybe another teacher will have to do it. Someone with, say, a knack for fashion. Uh, I I'm Wagstaff's fashion guy. I'm a better designer than all of you combined. I could sew you under the table. Oh, really? Well, why don't you put your knitting needles where your mouth is? One last challenge all of us against you. Mr. Branca judges. Right, Mr. Branca? I like clean lines and simple silhouettes. Ugh. No. I don't want to work with Tina. I won't do it. Tammy shush. I'm getting us out of here. I don't want to work with Tina. I don't I Stop it! Just shush. Shush! If you win, we'll tell Principal Spoors that you scared us fabulous, and that you're the best dressed man we've ever seen. But if we win, we all get to leave early. I'm a knitter, not a quitter. Kids, you're on. All right! Hell yeah! Oh, my God, yeah! Let's do it. You can take our Saturday morning, but you'll hopefully never take away our mid-to-late Saturday afternoon! Let the ultimate challenge begin. The fashionista versus the detentionistas. I can't believe I have to work with Tina. She smells like failure, and her hair smells like ketchup. It's not like I want to work with you, either, Tammy. And you're wrong. My hair doesn't smell like ketchup. My skin does. Oh. You guys, try to keep it together for one last challenge. We'll all get out of here, and you can hate each other on the outside. Let me paint a picture. I am president in the old country. The revolution is underway. The rebels have charged into my palace, dragged me onto the street, and are demanding justice. I must give a speech. I want you to design a look that will save my life using a material that I now work with every day in your wonderful country. Trash. You have 20 minutes. Dig! Let's go! Let's go! So what do we owe you? Let's call it $160. Hmm. That's not how much magazines cost. Hey, Bob. Just wanted to check how many kids you were gonna be picking up from detention. Still three? Not now, Jimmy. We're in the middle of something here. Yeah? What are you talking about? What are you doing? You know what? Just Nah, you-you wouldn't be interested. Ha! Yeah, you're right. But, uh, you know, tell me so I can not be interested. Well, we were just using some of our profits to help Sally here with her textbooks and communication skills and Turtle Camp. Just some philanthropy. You know, giving back to the community. We bought 20 magazine subscriptions, but it's not a big deal. Nothing you'd be interested in. I could buy 40. I don't think you could. Oh, yeah, I could easily. I give back like a son of a bitch. Hey, uh, why don't you guys come over to my place after you're done here? I'll take two of everything. Whoa! Yes, sir! You got it.  Ha-da doo-Dee.  You should receive your first issues in ten to 12 to 18 weeks, huh? Okay, thanks for your support. Bye! And I'll send you a postcard from Turtle Camp. Aw, I hope you do, Sally. I really hope you do. Me, too. I hope I do it, too. Bye. Love you, Sally! Okay, thank-thank you. Today was a good day. Yeah. We got screwed, but Jimmy got screwed more. Yeah. I found some cucumber. Maybe we can make a cucumber-bund? Come on, Philip. It's time to prove yourself to the world. Let's make something Fronderful! Aah, we're out of peanut butter! Where are we gonna find something that can wrap around a human wrist? Hey. What if Tina and Tammy each threw away their bracelets? Then we could use them to hold up the lettuce. Great idea J-Ju! Thanks, Zeke! No way. My sparkle jelly stays on my wrist until I die, and then probably even after that. Tina can throw hers away. Why don't we throw Tammy away? Come on, girls! Work together for God's sake! Guys, we're gonna lose! We're supposed to be at the Cotton Candy Festival right now, and instead we're standing in a freaking Dumpster! They're just stupid sparkle jelly bracelets! They're not stupid! They're made of rubber, and they have a little charm on them, and they define who you are. Oh, my God, they are stupid. I don't need this sparkle jelly to dazzle. I dazzle on my own. We all do. Except for Tammy. How sure are we that this is peanut butter? 'Cause it's starting to burn. Sorry to interrupt. Go on with what you were saying. Tammy, these bracelets are what got us in here. Let's use them to get us out of here. I'm throwing mine away. Thanks, T. Tammy, now you throw away your bracelet. We need it to hold up the other arm. What do you say, Tammy? Let the fashion show begin!   This is my design. It is a slim-fitted European-style suit. Apparently, Hildy the lunch lady cuts her hair in the parking lot, which I have used to make a fur lapel. This is our fresh new design made of not-so-fresh lettuce. It's a tailored suit, perfect for a summertime wedding, or a summertime revolution. Mmm! Designers, I am impressed. Both teams did an excellent job making my trash suit. Mr. Frond, your outfit had class and sass. Kids, the tailored fit around the wrists of my lettuce suit was impeccable! We can easily change it to peccable if you prefer. But there was a clear winner. The kids! What?! Mr. Branca, there must be some mistake. Wait. Did Tina and Tammy give up their bracelets to secure your sleeves? Did you collaborate on fashion and build a bridge to friendship and understanding? We sure did, Mr. Frond. Let it go, Tammy! No! Never! Never! Never! I'll take your arm off with it if I have to! Maybe I did rehabilitate you kids after all. Yeah, maybe. Ah! I missed you, outside world! What year is it?! To the candy! It's made of cotton! Oh, my God. It's Principal Spoors. All the kids are gone. Oh, my God. Fire! Fire!  Don't you love cotton candy?   It's made of cotton and also candy   If your fingers get sticky   Eat off your hand, lickety-licky   Don't you love cotton candy?   Ah, don't, don't, don't, don't   Don't you love cotton candy?   Oh, yeah."
"I want some burgers and fries   I want some burgers and fries  Well, there's some right here!  Don't you tell me no lies!  I can't tell if they're helping or hurting us out there, but I think hurting. Got me in here. You're here every day, Teddy. True, but today, it's 'cause of them. I think they sound good! It's better than this stupid hold music. Oh, hi, Dr. Rinaldi! No, no, I love your hold music. Listen, Doc, the rash is still there. I did everything you said no shaving, no deodorant. Oh. Yeah. But now it's in both armpits. Eh. Mm-hmm. It's red and flaky itchy, bumpy. Sometimes it's oozy. I look like Jeff Goldblum in The Fly. Lin, please stop describing your rash. I'm on the phone with the doctor, Bob! I know. Everyone knows. Shh! Sorry, folks. It's not It's not a big deal. It's not I mean, it doesn't get in the food. No, no, no, where are you going?  You want some burgers and fries!  Talking to you, buddy! Hey, thumbs up! Yeah! I got a thumbs up! That's better than a customer! Cool song, Gene. Yeah, you guys sound good. I'm diggin' it. You happen to be in the presence of child straw prodigies. We're pretty straw-some. That's awesome, but with straws? Strawsome? We borrow from a lot of genres. Maybe you guys can use a little wind? Whoa! You just walk around with that thing? We were at orchestra practice. And, hey, why make it difficult when you can make it cymbal? Are we punnin', or are we jammin'? Oh! Oh! Ah! Ooh! Guys, you know what this is, right? Tuesday? Oh, my God, it's trash day. No, we're a band. Finally, it's happening. Wait. We weren't a band before? Uh before we had the ""raz,"" but we needed the ""matazz."" So what do you say? Yeah! Let's do it! Okay. All right, but I don't carry my own equipment. Yeah! That's the spirit! Okay, thanks, Doc. Boy, can that lady talk about rashes. What did she say? The rash'll probably go away on its own, but I got to wear a tank top to let it breathe. It's festering under there, I guess. Look at it. Can you see it? Lin, please! It's like my grandma used to say. Starve a fever, feed a cold and air out a festering rash in a tank top. Whoa, kids. Outside only with the loud noise, remember? Dad, this is the noise of a band. Aw, you guys are a band? That's fun. What's your band name? We're called The Itty Bitty Ditty Committee. 'Cause we have little ditties. Oh, now I get it. All right, everyone. This is the first official band practice, slash, band lunch for The Itty Bitty Ditty Committee. Yay! Oh, we were supposed to bring slash lunch? I didn't get the slash memo. Peter, I think you'll like the changes I made to your recorder. Oh. I electrified it. Give her a toot. Cool. Let's wail.  Burger and fries, burger and fries   Uh, uh, uh, uh!  All right, so we got that song. Is it really a song, though, if you just say words over and over? Hmm. Good point. I guess most songs are sung. But here's the thing. When I sing, people don't seem to really, uh how do I, uh, put it? Oh, yeah, enjoy it. Same with these two. It depends on your definition of ""enjoy."" I just prefer chanting. Can you guys sing? No.: Not if I want to live. If only we knew someone who could really sing. I think we do. Follow me.  Oh, oh, here she comes   Watch out boy, she'll chew you up   Oh, oh, here she comes   She's a maneater  Of course, Darryl the computer-nerd songbird. He's like a funky Bill Gates.  The woman is wild, oh  Wow, he can sing. And he hardly even fainted.  Oh, oh, here she comes, she's a man  Darryl! Aah! Don't do that! Darryl, ever think about being the lead singer of a band? Like, only every day. Great! You can be the lead singer of our band. You guys are a band? Why don't you see for yourself? So, yeah, we're a band. Guys, this is nice, but Casio and straws at lunchtime? This is kind of kids' stuff. I'm just saying, if I'm gonna join a band, it's gonna be a real band, like Steely Dan. Darryl, honey, don't wait around for Steely Dan. He's not coming for you. He's not coming for any of us. It could happen. Just sing with us. If you, like, know a song that goes with these chords. Fine. One song, but nothing from  Frozen, 'cause I don't want to cry.  Girls, girls  Hey, Lenny Destefano. Are you hiding from one of your many girlfriends? Yup. Hey, you guys sound good. Are you a band? Yes! Um You guys want to play my birthday party this Saturday? GENE, RUDY, PETER & DARRYL: Yes! Cool. : Not so fast, Lenny. We have to go over the particulars. What do you mean? We want the corner pieces of the cake, half of the piÃ±ata candy and ownership of the streaming and performance rights worldwide in perpetuity. I'm not having a piÃ±ata. Get a piÃ±ata. Okay. See you guys Saturday. Oh, my God! We just booked a gig at Lenny Destefano's birthday party! So, are you in the band, Darryl? Heck, yeah, I'm in the band! Yeah! The Itty Bitty Ditty Committee just got their first giggy! You guys, I blocked out my schedule every day after school for band practice. Every day? That's a lot of practice. We don't want to sound too rehearsed. Uh, yeah, Gene, we do. We want to sound really good. Lenny Destefano's party is a big gig. All right, fine, as long as practice includes snack breaks. And bathroom breaks and commercial breaks where I describe my favorite commercials. Hey, Tina. Hey, Jimmy Jr. I guess you heard the news about the Itty Bitty Ditty Committee. Huh? I was gonna tell you that you're standing in front of my locker. Oh. Sorry. What's the Itty Bitty Ditty Committee? Is that one of those improv groups? My cousin was kidnapped by one of them. That's our band name. We're playing Lenny Destefano's party on Saturday. It goes from 5:00 to question mark. Just kidding. It ends at 7:30. Two burgers of the day. I'm wearing this tank top 'cause the doctor prescribed it for me. Lin, you don't have to say that to every customer. What? I don't want people to think I'm trying to look like a hot potato. What's going on under there? It's just a little hair. I haven't been shaving my pits. See? Oh, my God. Wait. Wha? It's just, there's so much of it. How long since you've stopped shaving? A few days. It grows in really fast. It's like animal fur. It looks like that guy's hair from Counting Crows. Yes! Okay, all right, everyone's having fun. Say good-bye to Mr. Jones. Aah. Guys, I wrote a song for Lenny's party. Darryl, here are the lyrics. ""His name is Lenny. ""It is not Jenny. One time he ate a penny, and he thought nobody saw."" Is that true? True enough. I changed the name of the guy who ate the penny from ""Gene"" to ""Lenny,"" and it was a nickel. And two pennies and a tiny rock. All right, follow my lead.  His name is Lenny  You know what? This key isn't working for me. Can we try it in D or E flat? No can do. Why not? 'Cause no know how to do. I can only play in this key. And I don't know which letter that is. Yeah, that's it. Here. Let me see. Uh  His name is Lenny  Are we playing in the right key? Oh, yeah.  One time he ate a penny and he thought nobody saw  Whoa! Whoa! Well, that was a mess! Let's not do that again! Ever. Right guys? Okay, all agreed. How was band practice, kids? Good. Fine. I thought it was kind of weird. Right, guys? Didn't you think it was weird? You mean when Darryl played your keyboard? And you stood there looking terrified? Yeah, that was weird. Darryl played your keyboard? Why? You know how when you only know how to play in one key, and the other people want to play in different keys, and you're, like, ""What's a key?"" Whoa! Mom, your armpit forests are really filling out. You can barely see your rash anymore, or your skin, or anything behind you. Dad, are you there? Yes, Tina, I'm right here behind the armpit hair. Oh. Good. I love it! We finally have pets. I'm calling them ""Laverne and Curly."" Too late. I already named them ""Harry and Sally."" Wait. One's a boy? Obviously. It's not a boy. It's a man! No, it's not! I'd know if one was Billy Crystal. Everyone leave my pits alone! That one just got angry when you got angry. Enough! So, Linda's cooking today? Yeah, she, uh, thought she'd be more comfortable back there today. I'm hiding my pits. Lin, would it help if I took off my shirt in a show of solidarity? I got some weird stuff going on under here. No. Teddy, no. Maybe. Coming off. HUGO: Surprise! As in surprise inspection. Ugh. Hugo. Hi. Hi, Ron. I see you're busy as usual. Just do what you got to do, Hugo. Write me up for disorganized napkins or whatever. Oh, count on it, Bob. I will. But let's inspect the kitchen first. Hello, Hugo. Hi, Ron. Hi, Linda. Linda, something is unusual about you today. What is that? What? Nothing. It's nothing. Think fast! Ah! Aha! Aw. Linda here is in violation of Health Code Title 21, Section A, Paragraph eight. ""Excessive body hair must be covered."" But I need to wear a tank top. Need to? Why? Because of this rash shida Jones. Uh, big fan. Oh, yeah. She likes tank tops, too. She does. She loves them. Uh-huh. Well, I happen to have some armpit hairnets with me. Ron? Here you go. Ugh! Are you kidding me? If you want to avoid a citation, you'll keep those on. Come on, Ron. Let's go down to the walk-in. Poke the produce, see what pokes back. Great. Now I look ridiculous. No. They look good? Yeah, very, uh Wow. It looks like I trapped two hedgehogs under my arms. It doesn't that much. I love hedgehogs. I got to go! - Lin, where are you going? - I'm shaving 'em! Lin, wait. Teddy, I'll be right back. I got to go. Go to her, Bobby! Lin, don't do this. I'm doing it, Bob! I'm taking it all off! The doctor said if you shave, you're just gonna make it worse. I can't believe I'm saying this, but leave the hair alone. I hate this rash, Bobby! It's turning me into a monster! You're not a monster, Lin. Your armpits have monster qualities, but Look, we're gonna fix this. How? First, you got to give me the razor. You're gonna do it? No. I wouldn't go near that. Bob! We'd have to rent a hedge trimmer, or hire, like, a lumberjack or something like that. Stop it! Lin, listen, we're gonna go on the Internet. Yeah? We're gonna type in ""rash remedies."" Uh-huh. And we're gonna see some horrible, horrible images. But we're also gonna get some help. I love you so much, Bobby! Hi. Wait. Did we have practice scheduled during lunch today? Hey Gene. Uh, maybe, uh, you should sit down. Oh, good! I got here just in time for break, my favorite part of practice. Who's on whose lap? Gene, there's there's a reason why we were practicing without you. Because you guys need twice as much practice as me? No It's because we're making some changes, and, uh, you are, uh We thought we should be in the band, and you shouldn't be in the band. Sorry. What?! I'm out of the band?! Well, good luck getting my sisters to play without me! Oh, yeah. They're out, too. Yeah. We're sort of evolving away from straws. The thing is, Gene, Rudy and Peter are trained musicians. And I kind of figured out how to sing all your keyboard parts. You can't sing my part and sing lyrics at the same time! Gene, he can. We've seen it and it's so good. Yeah, I brought in a looper pedal, so I can just  Skoop bop boo boo   Skoop bop boo boo   Skoop bop boo boo, skoop bop boo boo   I can sing on top of my voice   That's me, this is also me  But this is my band! I started all of this! Yeah, and you're, like, the most fun member. Yeah. Yeah. I'm all drama. But the thing is you can't actually play. You only know three chords! But I know them very well! Well, two of them I know very well! The other one I'm just getting acquainted with! This is hard for everyone, Gene. But mostly for me! DARRYL and RUDY: Yeah. True. Fine! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get really, really good in time for Lenny's party! Lenny's party's in two days, Gene. I know that, Darryl! You guys are gonna be begging me to listen to you beg me to come back! The door's always open, Gene. Except can you close it on your way out? I will slam it! Stupid safety door closing thing! Oh, kicked out of your own band. They David Lee Roth'd you. I'm glad we got kicked out. That was starting to cut into my not-going-to-band-practice time. And that time is precious. I'm okay with it. Now I can focus on my solo straw stuff. Like drinking liquids. Guys, we're gonna get back together. I'm just gonna become the greatest musician in the world in the next 48 hours and that'll be that. Easy. What are you gonna do, Gene? Go down to the crossroads, make a deal with the devil? Almost. I'm gonna ask Ms. Merkin to teach me. The music teacher at school? The Queen of the Keys? Yep! I figure one quick power sesh should get me ready for Lenny's party. Great plan, honey. I'm ready for the garlic, Bob. Not to be all Miss When Is Dinner but when is dinner? And what is dinner? You've been stirring that stuff forever. Oh, this isn't dinner. This is a home remedy for my armpit rash. We found it online. What?! It's well past dinnertime! Sorry. It's just feed your children. Okay, uh, Bob, hand me the oatmeal, the fish oil, and the buttermilk. No fair. Why do your armpits get to eat all the fun stuff? Oh, it smells really weird. Hmm. It's not that bad. I mean, it's a little weird. Okay, it's really weird. I'm just gonna try it. No! Tina! It's my medicine! Just give Tina whatever your armpits don't finish. I'm so hungry! Bob, order a pizza. Get one with oatmeal, fish oil, and buttermilk on it.  So you want to become a skilled musician. Yes. Well, good news, all it takes is practice No discipline No. and hard work. No! Okay. Hearing a lot of no's. Look, I just want to get good enough to get back into my band, get discovered, make it big, throw it all away, get it back again, and we'll see what happens from there. Okay. Let's open up the workbook. Work book? Do you hear how you sound right now?! Gene, settle down. Listen to this. That's a terrible song. It's not a song. It's scales. Gross. It's not gross. It's gross. It's scales. It can't be gross. It's gross. It's not gross! It's scales! Well, I'm just sayin', it could use drums or somethin'. What? Nothing. Again. Again?! We've been doing this for hours! You've been doing it for 45 seconds. Aah! I can't take it anymore! Gene, you don't become a skilled musician overnight. But that's exactly what I have to do! Lenny Destefano's birthday party is tomorrow! You're playing Lenny Destefano's birthday party? I was. Why don't you try and book next year or the year after that and practice until then? And see if you can get me on as your opening act, would ya? Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna be a skilled musician. I think I'm just gonna go home. Would it help if I played you out? Maybe.  He's a-leavin' little early, but that's okay   He seems real depressed and a  Okay, not helping! What? Not helping! All right. It was a work in progress. There's my little Genethoven. How was your first music lesson? What'd you learn? I learned that I don't have what it takes. What are you talkin' about? You've got swagger, you got flare, you got panache. What else is there? I'm not getting back in my band or any band! I'm never gonna get to hear one of my songs used in a Hyundai Elantra commercial! Never! Aw, I'd give you a hug, hon, but I'd get stinky pit paste all over your head. Why do I never get that warning? Time to reapply. Ugh! Oh, God, you released the beast! It smells fine if you don't breathe. : We got to move, Lin. It's gonna stink up the whole place. All right, we're goin' out to the alley to reapply. Tina, Louise, comfort your brother. There, there. I know what'll make you feel better. Here comes Ticklin' Tina. Tickle, tickle, tickle. I don't need to be a musician. In fact, I don't need music at all. Really? What? Stop looking at me like that, keyboard! You know I'm right! What would you do instead? Mmm. Maybe I'll be a baker. Or a candlestick maker.  Maybe I'll be a potter   Or a teacher like Welcome Back, Kotter   Maybe I'll juggle or maybe I'll juice   Be a Top Gun and be friends with Goose   One thing I know for sure   I don't need music   I don't need you anymore   I don't need music   I'm gonna kick you right out the door   I   Don't   Need   Music   Anymore!  Aah! Why don't you take the hint and leave me alone?! Here! Take this thing and get rid of it for me! What are you saying? I never want to see or hear from it again. Burn it. Gene, you don't want to do that. Take it! I have to report to the Miramar Naval Air Station in Miramar, California! Come on out, sweetie. You been in there all morning. Gene, come on, we gotta open up the restaurant. No, thank you! I'm fine! We missed you at breakfast. We missed all your funny banana jokes. That one where you pretend the banana is your penis. Eh, don't love that one. Why? It's a little easy. Why? What do you mean, ""easy""? He's got other ones. Like what? Which ones? He does the banana mustache, he does Captain Banana Oh, yeah. Ooh! I know what'll get him out. Who wants to see Mommy's big hairy pasty pits? Nah. Good idea, Lin. All right, all right. Nice try from the B-team. You guys go ahead downstairs. The A-team will take it from here. Gene, we're coming in. B-team? All right. We're leaving but only because we have to open the restaurant. And we're not the B team. No, like in a good way. : Not in a good way. So, you're, uh, still done with music, right? Yes. You haven't changed your mind? Nope. This is what I'm doing now. Okay. Cool. Oh! I almost forgot.

We knew it! We knew you still cared! And that's why we didn't burn your keyboard. What? This isn't my keyboard? No. We burnt Dad's new socks. Who does he think he is? If you want to see your real keyboard, put on your burger suit, do something about that hair, and come with us. Come on, Gene, let's play together, like we used to. You play the keyboard and we'll play the cups. Like old times. No. I can't. I'm not a real musician. Well, you're definitely a real something. Maybe ""musician"" just isn't the right word for you. Maybe you're a musishy. Come on, Gene. Just one song. Yeah. And after that, if you're still done with music, we'll really burn this sucker. Uh Mmm uh Come on. There we go. This is going well.

"My birthday. Boy Ah. Oh. I can't even say it to myself. Forty-f Forty-f Oh. Maybe I'll sleep through this one. Mom! Are you up yet? We may or may not have a surprise for you. We're coming in! Put your boobs away. Excuse me, young lady, we're looking for our mother, to serve her breakfast in bed on her birthday. Yeah, we don't mean to bother you. You're obviously in the middle of a photo shoot, 'cause you're a youthful supermodel. Guys, this is Mom. What?! Oh! Happy birthday, Mom! Happy toast, eggs and orange juice, pretty mom! Thank you, kids. It's lovely. The best part of my birthday is my babies bringing me breakfast in bed every year. Ah-ah-ah, not so fast. There might be more this year. Oh. Okay, ""add a drop of witch hazel to the egg whites for even tighter, smoother skin."" Don't have witch hazel, but how about vinegar? Same thing. Maybe. Linda is gonna love this. ""You're right, Bob. You're the best husband."" Thank you, vinegar. I'm glad witch hazel's not here. Oh. Oh, the toast is a little burnt. Yep, just the way you like it. Oh, and hard. Burnt and hard. Every year I say, ""Why does she like it this way?"" But then I say, ""Hey, make it the way she likes it."" Kids, I could use a little help in here. But we like to watch her graze, Dad. Go on, I'm good. Maybe bring me some new toast! Stir until frothy. That's subjective. Kids, does this look frothy to you? Mm I've seen frothier. What is that, egg whites? Mostly. And vinegar. Gene, would you slice up that cucumber? On it. And, Tina, can you do this? A mayonnaise hair treatment? Mom's hair is gonna shine like a beautiful sandwich. Why is home spa day so delicious? Oh, Louise, and can you just clean up this mess? What?! You're the youngest. I'm also the worst at cleanup. Look. Gene, after you're done with the cucumbers, clean up. No. Tina, after you do the hair treatment, can you clean up? Okay. Can I come out now? Not yet, Lin! What? How about now? Almost! Now? Not really close at all, sorry. Oh Well, did you happen to get milk yesterday? Huh? No, I forgot. I was preoccupied with something That I think you're gonna like! That's nice, but somebody has to do the shopping! I'll do it this afternoon! Okay, I'm getting a little cabin fever in here. What if I go to the store and do our shopping while you guys do whatever you're doing that I don't know about? Stay in there! Don't make us chain you up! Actually, that could work out perfectly. We could use the extra time. What? I'm gonna blindfold her. Double-bag the head. Ow. Doing good. Ow. Little to the left. Ow! Louise! I-I said to your left. Ow. Ow. And we're here. Ugh. Why'd I have to be blindfolded? 'Cause you're a sneaky peeky. Hey, take your time, Lin. Uh, treat yourself. Go to the good store. You mean the one that's further away? Yeah! The good store? Get the premium fudge pops! Don't you come home without them! Yeah, for your birthday. Right, happy birthday! See you when you get back! - Bye. - Oh, and can you get more mayonnaise? We're out and I need it today. But not for a surprise. Just, um, 'cause I need it. Okay, Tina. Thank you. Good-bye. It was nice, Ginger. It was nice, as always. But then they wanted me to stay in my room forever while they set something else up. I was going crazy in there! Meanwhile, no one did the shopping, so that's what I'm doing. Ugh, chalk festival. What's next, a crayon convention? A pencil parade? Right? Anyway, I know my family means well, but I wish I could just tell them I hate my birthday. You get to a certain age and they're no fun. In my 20s, I had va va voom, now I just have va va. And it feels like breakfast in bed is just practice now for when they put me in a home, right? Well, anyway, thanks for letting me vent, Ginger. Sorry for the long voice mail. Call me when you can. Love you, kid. Bye. This is taking forever. I can help whoever's next on check stand three! Oh, great. Thank you. Uh, hey, excuse me! He said whoever's next. That's me. I'm next in line. You were behind me, 'member? You were just over there Oh, it's okay. I only have a few things. This and that and this other thing. A few things? She's got a cart full of juice. Deirdre! How's it going? Hi! Oh, my God, they know each other. Is all of this for ""Chalk of the Town""? Yeah, we're hoping for a bigger turnout this year. Ugh, that stupid chalk festival. I'm not sure about these cups though. Mm, good instinct. Since you brought it up, these are not the good cups. What? Tell me everything. They leak. I don't know why I even sell them. We have better cups for the same price. The ones on the bottom shelf, ironically. Well, clearly I got to have those cups. Go get them. I'll wait for you. Oh, thanks. I'm here till 3:00, I don't care. Unbelievable. Oh, and you might want to grab some more ice, too. - It's a hot one. - Good idea! She'll just be a second. You don't mind, right? Great, thanks. So, you're not done yet. Let's take a look at this receipt, see how much you saved today. Oh, gosh, yes. Oh, my God, please! Just end this! We're not getting any younger over here! Well, don't blame us for that. Anyway, thanks again for the tip on the cups. Hey, no problem. Let me know how they work out. Nice, uh, chalking with you. Oh-ho-ho, you! Finally! You sure you guys are done? Hold on. I have to put these old cups back. Stupid birthday. I hate cups. Nuts! Old flower petals from Mort's? Check. That's great, Tina. We'll spread them from the front door into the bathroom to the tub. Huh. Hmm. Huh. Yeah. That's, like, six six petals. Yeah, not a lot of funerals this month. Mort said to check back around the holidays. Maybe just one in the hallway, one in the doorway, and then one at the tub? Yeah. Well, we could get some branches. Yeah, I don't I'm not sure that will have the same impact. Hmm. Okay, well, just float those in the tub. That'll still be nice. And here's my New Age relaxation CD. A lady having a garage sale forced me to take it. That's pretty relaxing, I guess. Is is that whales? I think it's the saddest whale. This isn't that bad, you guys. I think we may have actually pulled this together. I mean, I know your mom, and she's really gonna like this. This could end up being a pretty decent birthday. Pretty decent birthday? More like best birthday! Best birthday? Best day of her life! Oh, mm Oh, come on! Aw, gum? Ew! Damn it! Wha oh! No, no, no, no, no, no! I hate my birthday! Hi. Me again. Uh, I locked my keys in my car and I was wondering if I could use your phone to call my husband. Mm, I'm sorry. Our phone is for employees only. It's an emergency! Locking your keys in your car is not an emergency. What? You can't check into a hospital with a bad case of ""you locked your keys in your car."" You know what? Fine. I'll ask to borrow someone's cell phone. No harassing our customers. Did you know your pants are ripped? Yes! Uh, excuse me, sir, can I borrow your cell phone? I locked my keys in my car, and I got to call my husband. Uh, I don't, uh, have a cell phone. You don't? What's that right there? What's that? I don't know. I got to go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, come back! I'm a good person! Hmm. Your mom's not picking up her phone. Um, let me try Aunt Gayle. Hi, Gayle, it's Bob. Uh, have you heard from Linda today? Yes, I know it's her birthday, Gayle. I just don't know where she is. Yeah calm down, Gayle. I-I'm sure she's fine. Gayle, pull yourself Gayle. Gayle! Gayle! Oh, my God, there she is. Hi, Linda. Uh, Gayle, she just walked in. She's fine, she looks great. Call you back later. Bye. You know Mom's not really here, right? Yes, Tina. Because you said she was you saw her. I know, but I was Forget it. Were you lying? All right. Yes. Listen, your mom probably just ran out of gas or something. I'll call Teddy and see if he can drive us out to the store. Wow. Going to the store with Teddy? Happy birthday to us. Hi. Hi. I know I look a little crazy, but I'm having a rough day. Uh-huh. It's my birthday Happy birthday! and I locked my keys and my cell phone in my car at the grocery store. Oh! The worst. Yeah. And I'm just trying to get home. Does this bus go to the wharf? You're in luck, yes! Oh! Please take me. I swear I will pay you the fare once I get it from my apartment. Please. Okay. Come on up. Oh! Oh, thank God. Thank you! Ha. Finally, something's going right. You won't regret this. Wait, wait, wait, where you going? The wharf is the other way! This is the express to Wildwood Wharf. What wharf did you think? Wonder Wharf! The one I was pointing at! I just thought you were a bad pointer. Pull over so I can get off. I can't pull over; We're on the highway. You'll have to wait until we get to our next stop. Oh, my God. Uh, well, I guess I'll just get on the next bus going the other way, right? That'd be me on my way back. Oh! Shouldn't be more than an hour and a half. Might as well just stay on. Hey, we can play the alphabet game! An hour and a half? Oh. I'll just walk back. Fine, we'll play till the next stop. There's an ""A"" on that sign. I'm winning. There's a ""B."" You're falling behind! I got two! It's gonna be fun. Ugh, those poor fudge pops. They don't stand a chance. They'll refreeze though, right? Right?! Sure they will, but they'll be in weird shapes. Ugh, super weird. Yeah. Where are you, Mom?! Okay, she's not in the store, but she definitely was. The checker did not like her. That was clear. How could you tell? It was clear. What do you mean? He said so. He hated her. He said he hate ""I hated"" ""your wife."" Huh. But he did say he thinks she took off walking. And we didn't see her on the drive here, so she must have walked in a different way? We'll never find her! There are dozens of ways to walk home! And dozens of women walking! How will we know which one is her? I'm already forgetting what she looks like. She's a woman. I think she's tall. Does she have glasses? I can't remember. Yes! Yes, she does. All right, let's focus, okay? She has a hook for a hand! I'm sure of it! Gene, no. Okay, so if I'm gonna walk it, I could cut through that way? You're pointing at me. Where did you learn to point? No, I'm pointing through you. But it's at me. The other side of the Oh, behind me? Well, that makes a lot more sense. Yeah, no, that's where you want to walk. Okay, thanks, Andrew. Bye, Linda. Bye. Okay, bye, Linda. Happy birthday. Beep-beep. That's me; The horn doesn't work. Bye. Well, this is the only other street your mom could've taken. Where is she? We got to find her. Every minute we're not with her, she's having a worse and worse birthday. She must have stopped somewhere, but where would she go? Is Chaka Khan in town? Nope, she doesn't come through till December. Mom probably got hungry. She needs to eat every 15 minutes or she becomes a monster. But she doesn't have any money. She locked her purse in the car. Oh, Devendorf's Bakery. They're really generous with their samples. Mom and I go there a lot. You do? Well, it's actually been a while. We're both worried about bathing suit season. I guess it's worth a try. To Devendorf's Bakery! To free samples! Ugh, mud. Okay, Linda. Try to look on the bright side. How often do you get to walk through a field? It's kind of neat. Look around. It's a nice day. Oh, here's a pretty flower. Oh! Oh, God, uh-oh, it's skunk. Oh, he's sleeping. Just gonna tiptoe away and not bother you. Oh, God! Oh, my face! Oh, God, that stupid skunk! Nocturnal idiot! Whoa! Oh, for the love of Pete! I can still see out of one side. Sort of. What's that black fuzzy thing? Oh, you little skunk! So this is where you go with your mom, huh? Yeah, now let me do the talking. You just look cute. Hey, you, long time no see. How's the pumpernickel today? Dry? Better try a sample. Hello, uh, I'm looking for my wife. She's got black hair and red glasses. And amazing wrists, but huge hands. Teddy. What? I'm just trying to be specific. You mean her? Yes. Wait, why do you have a photo of Wait, what does that say on the picture? It says ""Do not feed."" What? Do not feed. Your wife was abusing our free sample policy. She hasn't been in here since we posted the photo. She's been coming here without me? What did that guy do? He wants his crusts cut off. What did she do? She touches everything. Everything. What did he do? He's really racist. What did that baby do? He's just a jerk. Okay, fine. Thank you. Uh, we're leaving. Kids, let's go. You know, maybe don't give out free samples and then get mad at people when they eat them. Well, you know, unfortunately, we can't bake enough in a day to fill your wife's giant hands. There's only so much pumpernickel in the world. What did you say? Oh-ho, you poor dumb baker. Here comes the thunder. Guess what? No one talks about Hey. My wife's giant hands - Easy. - On her birthday! Except for Teddy, because All right he also complimented her wrists! And this pumpernickel is dry! And a little dirty. Please give me a ride! - I locked my keys in my car - Oh, God, go, go! And I got on the wrong bus and it's my birthday! All right, let's all think. Where else could your mom have possibly gone between the grocery store and home? Okay, okay, I'm Mom. I'm walking around, I'm singing. She stopped to poop! Of course! Why didn't I think of that? We should check the bathroom in the lobby of the Royal Oyster Hotel. Why that one? It's Mom's favorite. What? So that's what Mom means when she says she's going to shuck an oyster. Oh, my God. I want to see this bathroom. I could go. Let's go to the Royal Oyster Hotel. Should we call ahead to let them know we'll all be pooping? Oh, like you guys smell so good. Uh, turns out it was just number one. Thank you, Teddy. Not for me. I hit a grand slam. Really good job, Gene. Thank you. No Mom. But they did get a new potpourri. Mom's gonna love it. Excuse me, are you guests of the hotel? No, uh, we're, uh, we're we're just looking for my wife. She sometimes comes here to use the restroom. Oh, Linda? You must be Bob! Yes. Wait, y-you know her? Well, as much as you can know a woman who comes to your hotel once or twice a week to poop. Hey, isn't it her birthday today? Uh, yes. Hey, Tim. Have you seen Linda today? Oh, please, it's barely noon.  She does her B.M. in the p.m.  Hi, Tim.  Hey, Tina   How you doing, girl?  Huh, well, she's not here, so we better go. What? No, stay a little. We finally get to meet you after all these years. Years? Where does the time go? We-we really got to find my wife. Nice meeting you though. Bye. Bye. Say hi to Linda for me. Tell her we got new potpourri. She was absolutely right. Uh, will do. Just four more blocks. Oh, God, this thing? Welcome to Chalk of the Town. Oh, God, it's you. Oh, you and your dumb cups. What happened? Oh, you smell. It's been a rough morning, Deirdre. What is that, some sort of street diaper? You're a street diaper. No, you're the street diaper. No, you! Okay, you're the one actually wearing a street diaper, so if anyone is a street diaper, it's you. Step aside, street diaper. I'm going through. Oh, not without a ticket, I'm afraid. Well, I'm afraid it's a public street, so get out of my way. You should have been nicer at the grocery store and maybe I would. Uh-oh! Your cups are spilling! What are you do Oh, my God. I guess these weren't the good ones after all. Oh, don't! Stop! No! My chalksterpiece! Do not move. Just carefully step off. What is this? It's the story of America, and you're scuffing it up, you hag! Hag?! Yep. You know what I think? I think I'm gonna do a little twist. No. No. A little twist and shout. No! Don't you do it. A twist a twisty shout. How-how about the Charleston? I'm gonna Charleston on your face! Come back here! I'm gonna get you! Help! She's crazy! Get back here! She's destroying the art! No, I'm not! You're the one stepping all over everything! Sorry, sorry! Ooh, good manhole! Ooh, space! Hi, aliens! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Damn it! Wow. People are very divided on your mom. Where is she? Does this town have cults? Maybe she joined one of those. I might know a place where she could be. Where? She's probably not there. I shouldn't have said anything. Let's definitely not go. Well, she's not here. Let's call it. Wait, Louise, you and your mom come here? Used to come. To pet the puppies? No.  I guess. I don't know; I've never even come inside the store. I'm always outside just pitching pennies, breaking bottles, you know, being a hoodlum. Hey, Louise, I thought that was you. Oh, hi, Robert. Want me to get out Colonel Fluffles again? He missed you. Hi, Louise, how you doing? Oh, God, don't make eye contact. He's reeling me in. Colonel Fluffles! You're so  Someone comes to the pet store with Mom.  I'm beginning to think my secret bathroom trips with Mom aren't as fun as what you guys do. Uh, he's getting old. I'm just a puppy. Well, he's got cloudy eyes this time. Yeah, I know, his eyes are a little But I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I'm a scrapper. Oh, he looks lumpier than last time. I'm a little bit lumpy, but that's just more to love. Yes, that is. Want to say hi to Uncle Feathers? All right! Did it just say ""all right""? All right! Wow. Your mom leads a rich, kind of odd life that I did not know about. Bobby, does this parrot make me look cool? Oh, crap. I just realized, if Linda gets home, she can't get in. She doesn't have her keys. One of us should have stayed behind. Not it. Gene, it's too late. N-Never mind. Let's go. Ha! Ha! Ha-ha! I did it! I actually made it home. Bob! Kids! Let me in! Mommy's home! It's the birthday girl! Where are they? Aah! Ooh. Aah! Not gonna let this birthday win. Yes! I win! Son of a bitch. Ha! Ha-ha! Whoa! Mom? Lin? Happy Spa Day. That's me. You sure it was only one skunk, Mom? No, it was two, or it was the same guy twice. Mom, is it cool if I dip my grilled cheese in your tomato bath? Yeah, go ahead. Yeah! So, wait, what color were the horses again? Just plain brown, I guess. Yes. Lin, I got to tell you, I learned some new things about you today. Stuff I didn't know. Stuff I respect, kind of, and I'm glad to say, after all these years, I'm still finding little surprises. Also, I wrote all of that in your birthday card. See? Oh, yeah. Aw. Yep, I did that. But sorry your birthday was horrible, Lin. Hey, don't be sorry. This was the best birthday ever. What? Yeah. I kicked this day's butt. I still got it. I think I might even be getting better. I want this to be the new tradition. Every year on my birthday, you blindfold me and you drop me off somewhere with no cell phone and no money, and I have to make my way home. Deal! Now let's Bloody Mary up this tub! It's Mommy's birthday! - Gene, grab the vodka! - All right. On it!  B.M. in the p.m.   She does a B.M. in the p.m.   Not number one, number two   It's a potpourri for you and me, yeah   She does a B.M. in the p.m.   You gotta   When she gotta go, yeah   B.M. in the p.m.   She gotta go, yeah, when she gotta go, yeah   B.M. in the p.m.   She gotta go, yeah   'Cause when she gotta go, she gotta go   She does a B.M."
"Here you go, Teddy. Thanks for the rush order. I got a hell of a busy day ahead of me. Teddy, why did you ask for a to-go bag if you're gonna eat it here? I'm leaving, I'm leaving. Are you, though? Kids. It's good that you're so busy, Teddy. Yeah, I got a dry wall job in town, plus, I've been taking care of a summer house out on Craggy Neck. It's supposed to rain today, so I gotta put the lawn furniture under the deck. Sorry we asked. Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Handley. Your hot water heater? Yeah, I could be there today. All right I'll see you soon. And now I just took another job. Why would I do that?! Teddy! All right, calm down, Teddy. Hey, I'll go out to Craggy Neck for you. What? Really? Yeah, I want to go to a nice place and drag furniture under a deck. Take us! I could drag some furniture. Well, that'd be a big help. All right! Wait, if you're all going to some beach house, then I should go, too. We could close for a little while. But, Dad, what if people want to come to the restaurant? Oh, right. That's true. I p Just kidding, Dad. Just kidding. Oh. - All right, we're here. - All right! TINA and GENE: Yay! Oh. We're on the frickin' beach. That is quite a view. I mean, I know it's the same ocean near our house, but this one's better. I mean, it's on the beach. They probably have crabs bringing them the newspaper. That is the life. Oh, and it's so beautifully landscaped. Look at those boulders! Gene, get off the boulders. They love it! I got it. On my own. Because I'm strong. Good job, Dad! Oh, so pretty inside. Oh. The door's open. Should we go inside? Just to close the door? Well, I guess so. I mean, how else are we gonna close the door? Oh. We're inside. We're in the house. How did that happen? - What are you doing? - Aah! You're trespassing. You're in somebody's home. Well, technically it's somebody's summer home. That's different, right? Yeah. Totally legal. We're just shutting the door. Ooh, are we breaking and entering? As a family. So it's okay. Come stand next to me for two seconds. It'll feel like we're on vacation. No, Lin, we should go. Wow, this is nice. I feel really poor right now. Yeah. I guess we can stand here for another two seconds. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then we'll leave. Okay. But we're not touching anything. Yeah. Sure. Of course not. Huh. I think I like boats now. Aw, these must be the owners. Cute couple. Little age difference but that's okay. Oh, and they travel. Must be nice. Pushing up the Leaning Tower. Couple of hams. Do you think we should get a boat? And a subscription to a boat magazine? Look at that ring! Looks like a disco ball. She's got Studio 54 on her hand. I think I'm gonna get one. I think I'm gonna get a boat; A big boat. Wait, what are we doing? We-we got to go. Kids, we're leaving! Kids, we gotta go oh, my God. Game room. Oh, hey, Dad. Welcome to Funtown. Oh, I forgot to get a big house so we could get a pool table. We do have to go, but first, I should probably teach you kids how to play pool. We know how to play. You just roll the balls and hear them click. So far I'm winning. Yes. All right, kids, there are a couple things in life I'm really good at, and pool is one of them. What are the other things? And don't say burgers. Prepare for the thunder that is my break. Tina, step to the side. I don't want the shockwave to hit you. Whoa. That was terrible. Yeah, I thought maybe it was, but I wasn't sure, so I just said ""whoa."" It's probably the cue. Oh, yeah. This one is crazy warped. It looks straight to me. Yeah, you can't use a cue stick like this. No Okay. This one feels not warped. Corner pocket, your mouth is open, I hope you're hungry! Damn it! Whoa Is that is that good? Ooh, they're skiers. So sporty, those two. Look like Hart to Hart. Do you know who gave me this water? The refrigerator did! What? Came right out of the door! Goodness. What are you up to? I'm just curious who these people are. You know, what books they read, what kind of music they like. Got it. You're snooping. What?! I'm not snooping. I'm just noticing. Sure. Ooh, they climbed a mountain. Good for them. Should we go ""notice"" around in that room? Ooh. Home office. Look, they get mail. That's fun. Ooh, and we got a name! Larry Goodwin. Why do they have so many clocks? How much time do you need? Spooky. They all stopped at 3:13. Oh, wait, they all moved. I think I figured it out. Look at this: They all say Goodwin. Larry Goodwin! Larry's rollin' in clock money! So that's how you afford a beach house. We've been going about it all wrong. Did you see that drawer open all by itself? It just popped open. It did, didn't it? Yeah, look at that. Just popped right open. Well, that's weird. Aw, their wedding picture. Wait, that woman looks different than the one in all the other pictures. Huh. She does. She had a totally different forehead. Must've got it reduced. Mom, this is a different wife. This must be the first wife! And Larry traded her in for a newer, prettier model. That bastard! You think you know somebody! Larry! Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Someone's here. Are you just saying that because I'm beating you? Shh! Hide. Bob? Linda? You guys in here? Yeah? Why? Right. Why. Yeah. Why are you inside the house? Right. Teddy. Good question. Right, Bob. What are you doing in the house? Uh Linda? Jump in any time. Wait a minute, this isn't under the deck. Bobby, why'd you make us come in here, you silly? Thanks, Lin, that was great. Sorry, Teddy. We shouldn't have come in. Poking around, huh? Trying the hall on for size? I get it. You take a bath? What? No. Your loss. Teddy, why are you here? We came all this way so you wouldn't have to. The weather's getting real stormy. I thought I ought to make sure the house is all sealed up. Yeah, I'm sure Larry Goodwin would appreciate it. Much more than he appreciated his first wife, who dared to age. Huh? Keep up, Dad. Right on, Mom. I wouldn't know anything about Larry. I never met him. He died before I started working here. Larry's dead? Larry's dead! Yeah. Terrible accident. He slipped on the widow's walk up on the roof and fell onto the decorative boulders below. I thought those boulders seemed traumatized. Helen, the wife, she's a doll. Nicest woman in the world. Poor thing witnessed the fall from the rose garden. Oh, my oh, my God. What if Little Miss Second Wife didn't witness the death? What if she did the death?! Of course! What? Helen killed her husband for his clock fortune! She's a black widow! We are in the tastefully decorated house of a killer. Huh. It is tastefully decorated. It's all right. Come on! Helen's not a murderer. Whoa, Lin, That's a pretty big accusation. Ye, well, murder's a pretty big crime. All right. Time to go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dad. We're not leaving until we find evidence we can take to the fuzz. This is a hot cold case. Yeah, we owe it to Larry and his clock family. You two cannot be serious. Look at her shifty snake eyes. Yeah, if you take away her warm smile, she's got the ice-cold stare of an ice-cold murderer. And if you take away her nose, she looks really weird. Yeah, and if you take away half of her face, she's like half face. Guys, come on. This is Helen we're talking about. She was in the rose garden when Larry slipped and fell. Oh, you mean Larry, the mountain climber, 'Cause he didn't slip! Helen pushed him off the widow's walk! She pushed him! No, no, no, no. You're really stretching, guys. Teddy, what else can you tell us about Larry's ""accident""? Eh, it was a freak thing. The guy leaned against the railing and it gave way. The cops said it was loose. I bet she loosened the railing. With what? Magic? What could possibly remove a nail from wood? The back of a hammer. The-the thingies. Teddy, where does she keep her tools? She doesn't have any tools. She's not very handy. Also Eh, forget it. What, Teddy? What? Well, I think she might be hiring me because she's lonely. She's definitely not a killer. She's really the sweetest little thing. She's not little, she's regular-sized. Aw, just talking about her gets me all frazzled. Teddy, do you have a crush on Helen? What? Huh? No. Aw! Does she have a crush on you? Does she drop things in front of you so you both have to bend down and pick them up? Sometimes we have tea on the deck and just talk for what feels like minutes. Linda, can we have a word in private? No. Yes. What, Bob? I'm onto something here. You're not. I am. The only thing you're doing is messing up a possible relationship for Teddy. This Helen lady sounds like she's nice and lonely, and Teddy is probably a good match for someone nice and lonely. Or anyone. Teddy should date anyone that likes him, basically. Anyone except someone who's gonna murder him. But maybe even that's okay. For Teddy. Oh my God, I just thought of something. Teddy, so Larry landed on the decorative boulders in the backyard? That's right. Look at this photo. Notice anything? Even at his age, Larry could still pull off cargo shorts? Mm-hmm. There are no boulders! Exactly! 'Cause Helen put 'em there when she came on to the scene. And then she pushed Larry right onto 'em, ensuring his death. You guys are really jumping to conclusions here. You mean pushing to conclusions, Dad? Teddy, how do you get up to the widow's walk? We're gonna reenact a little murder. Storm's really whipping up out there! I can't hear you! The storm's really whipping up! Linda! You're not going out there. It's too dangerous! It's fine, it's fine! Whoa! Never mind, never mind. Let's do it inside. Mom's hair looks terrible. I know. I can't look at her. But you can't look away. I'm just looking kind of to the side. Okay, so here's what I think happened. Bob, you're Larry. No. Sweet, dead Larry. Ugh, God. I'm Helen. I'm a bad person, and I want your money so onto the boulders with you! Ow! Ow, my back. Did you actually have to push me? I think that's exactly how it happened, Mom. Uh-huh. Nah, nah. There's no way Helen's a killer. - Seriously, I think my back is - bad. All right, all right, you baby. Let's help you onto the couch. Dad's hair looks horrible. It always looks horrible. There we go. We never should have come into this house. It's all right, everybody. It's probably just a brownout. I'm not, like, too scared. Helen! Hey. You're here. It's her. Her hair looks amazing. Let's ask her where she goes. So, Helen, uh, I thought you were in New York. I decided to get away for a few days to my vacation home. And who are these people in my vacation home? Right. These are my friends. They're a family. They're Belchers. Sorry, you see, I asked them to You take your dirty children and get the hell out! Oh, God. Helen, I'm sorry. I : I'm kidding! What a fun, terrifying joke. Isn't she a hoot? Oh, I'm glad you're here. I've been driving for hours in that storm. Surprised the roads are open. Welcome! I'm Helen. Hi, I'm Bob. These are my kids, Tina, Gene, and Louise. And this is my wife Linda. Nice to meet ya, Helen. You're making a lot of eye contact, little girl. That's a killer handshake you've got there. Thank you. I'm, uh I'm really squeezing. Anyways, we should get home before the roads get any worse. Come on, kids. What?! Mom, I thought you wanted to solve the crime! Safety first! I have to protect my babies! Helen, what car snacks do you have? Oh, I need to not stand up. Are you okay? Nah, he's fine. He's faking it. Come on. I'm not faking. My wife pushed me. Yeah, pushed by a lady. - You know how that is, Helen. - Louise. You know, I have some pain relievers from back when I used to take a lot of pain relievers. Would you like some? Yes, please. No, he doesn't. No, no, no. Uh, yes, I would. Thank you. Great. I'll be right back. See? She's nice. Do you think she likes me? I'm not really a fair judge since she wasn't too helpful with the car snacks. Bob, we got to get out of here! She's a killer! Linda, I can't go anywhere because someone pushed me. Mom, we got to stay and see this through! This case could make our careers! There is a 90% chance she kills us in the next hour! She's a nice lady whose husband fell off a roof. You've got to stop. Does anyone have any cologne? Gene? No. I'm not allowed to wear cologne again until I prove I can be responsible with it. I have a cough drop in my pocket. Give it. All I know is that woman is a mur maid. Mermaid! And that's the history of mermaids. Oh, thanks, Mom! Such amazing creatures. Hey, Helen. Hi. And here you go. Oh! Boop! Uh, boopsie. Oh! What happened there? Crazy arms. Good thing there's more where that came from. Here you go. Ha! Wow, Bobby! What a fun couple you are! Ah, it's been a while since we've had a storm like this. I locked down all the windows. Nothing's getting in. Okay, water's getting in that one, that one's leaking. Bob, she might be trying to poison you! Yeah, Dad, do you have a death wish? People don't put poison in pills. They put it in food or drinks. You know what would be great right now? Hot chocolate. Huh? : Mini marshmallows! Would be nice right now, but I don't have any. You have a car. Oh, none for me, thanks. Yeah, sorry, we don't like hot chocolate, any of us. Mother, you do not speak for me. I didn't know I didn't like hot chocolate. Yeah, you don't. I'll take theirs. I could drink a gallon of this stuff. It burned the crap out of my tongue, but I love it. Teddy's dead. He's friggin' dead! Ow! Hey, these pain meds are starting to kick in. And my back is feeling A oh, much better. Happy to help. I took a couple, and I'm right there with ya. Yeah. These are good. Oh, yeah. I'd take more. I always take more. So, Helen, sorry to hear about your late husband. Oh, yes, he was a good man. Good, good, good, good, good. Uh-huh. Good taste, too, huh? Well, he chose me.  Ow. Oh, no, I just meant those beautiful decorative boulders out back. So solid and jagged. Did Larry pick those out? Oh, no, I picked those out. Larry had the tackiest taste in boulders. So you picked those out. How interesting. Very interesting. Very interesting. Yeah. I guess. I don't think so. So, uh, Larry was quite the mountain climber, huh? Larry? No. No, I'm the climber. I had to drag him to all those mountains. Larry used to call me ""Mount St. Helen."" Which I don't get. Oh, so he wasn't a good mountain climber? Yeah, he wasn't good at all. Total klutz. Huh. That's so Larry. You know, you have such a lovely home, Helen. Looks like Larry left you very comfortable. Oh, no, he left nearly everything to charity. Oh. Hmm. Charity. Well, everything except this house. And the place in New York. And Aspen. I'll get by. Uh, you know what? I got to poop, and would anyone like to join me? Family meeting. Of course, Mother, I could poop. Come on, everyone! Bobby, you might not have to go, but I want you to try, honey. I can't move. I'm gonna stay here with Henry. Helen. My name is Bob. Okay, so she put in the boulders. That's guilty. Guilty as hell. LINDA: All the more reason to get you kids out of here. But Larry was a klutz, So maybe he  did just fall off his own roof. Wait. Didn't he leave all his money to charity? Right. True. But how do we know Helen's telling the truth about that? Well, whatever her deal is, let's get out of this beautiful death house. And home to our hideous life house. Fine, but if anyone asks, we solved this thing, and we were brilliant. Ah, it's really coming down out there. The rain it's an expression, I think. You get it. I totally get it. You know, you have a wonderful family. And Teddy. You have a wonderful family and Teddy. I can't believe Linda thinks that you killed your husband. What? She does? Mm-hmm. She does. She thinks you loosened the railing, and you pushed him onto the boulders. But she's crazy, and you're nice. It's really coming down out there. I got to use that. That's a crazy expression. Okay, we all pooped. Uh, Bob, let's hit the road. You know, Linda, I have a suspicion you didn't all go poop. What? Of course we did. Something smells, Linda, and it's not the bathroom. Road's completely flooded. No one's getting in or out of here tonight. What? I guess it looks like you'll have to stay the night here. No. That's all right. We can swim home. Linda, I insist, and I always get my way. I'm very pushy. I call couch! So, do you still think Helen's a murderer? Yes, I do, but if we're all gonna get killed, we may as well go out playing video games. Well, I think she's innocent. No, she's a man-eater, like Ms. Pac Man here. Ms. Pac Man eats ghosts and fruit! Don't bring her into this! Oh, Helen, me sleep in your room? On the floor though, right? Not on the floor? In the bed with you? Okay. Spooning? Sure. You want to be the big spoon? You want? No, you want me to be the big spoon. Whoa, I hadn't thought of that. Okay, I'll take first watch. In a couple hours, we'll switch. Yeah, yup, you got it, Gene. I'm not Gene. I'm your wife Linda. Rub my face. - No. Aah! - Linda. Oh, I didn't see you there. 'Cause I snuck up on you. Come, take a walk with me. No, no. I'm pretty tired. Come, come. Mm. Mm. I'm grabbing your arm, you're walking with me. Here we go. Why you want to come up here? I wanted to check in with you. You wanted to check in, huh, on the widow's walk? I did. Because your husband says you think I killed my husband. No, no, don't listen to him. He's-he's stoned out of his mind. You think I did it. I can tell by your face. And because you're backing away. Every time I walk towards you. On the widow's walk. Helen. Where my husband died. Died, Larry. : Look who's here! The pool man! Rack 'em up, Gene. Pool's in session. Yay! It's loopy Dad! Am I talking funny? : Ahdo. Ahl. Ahourr. All right, let's play pool. Wait. Where's Mom? She went with Helen. Why? 'Cause Helen wanted to talk to her and be, like, ""Why do you think I killed my husband?"" Why would she be like that? 'Cause I told her Linda thinks she killed her husband. And why would you tell her that?! Because we're friends, Gene! Oh, my God. I got to find her! Okay, Helen, just stop moving, and I'll stop moving. Oh, Linda, be careful. You're standing almost exactly where Larry fell from. It's very slippery. Back off, sister! Wait. You were in the rose garden when you saw Larry fall, right? Mm, I was. I was so in the rose garden. Then why can't we see the rose garden from this very spot?! You can. It's right there. Oh, right, yeah. Pretty.  Linda, I didn't kill Larry. I loved Larry. Okay, I didn't love him, but I but I liked him. I liked being married to him. Right, yeah, yeah. Okay, I didn't like being married to him, but I liked getting married to him. Yeah, sure. Okay, I didn't like our wedding day. It was a hard day. But the point is, I'm not a murderer. I didn't kill him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I thought about killing him. Who hasn't? But I didn't. I-I couldn't. Right, right. Okay, I could, but I didn't. Oh, sure, yeah. Because he died. Oh, God! Aah! Oh! Oh! You saved me. Of course I did. If I let you fall, they would think that I killed you, and I'm not going through that again. Well, thank you. I'm sorry for accusing you of murder. You definitely didn't do it? I definitely didn't do it. You didn't push him and then kill him? I didn't push anybody! All right. Well, give me huggies. Oh. Aah, I'm pushing you! Oh, my face! No, I'm just kidding. I'm kid I'm just kidding. Oh. Ha, ha! Get away from my mom! Louise, no! She didn't do it! Ow! My neck! So sharp! Oh! So sharp! Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh, boy! Get her off! Sorry! She won't let us cut her nails. I'm so sorry, Helen. How many times do I have to tell you people? Helen is not a murderer! I know, I know. She promised she didn't kill Larry. Now we're gal pals. Of course she didn't kill Larry! She's a great woman. And she's got interesting collar bones and a perfect forehead, and-and she's I didn't mean to say all that. I Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ow! Aah! That's the guest bedroom! Ow! Ooh! Other bedroom! Oh! I got to fix that shingle! Oh! Ow! Ground. Sweet ground. I'm alive, everyone! Teddy! You fell so far! And for so long! How are you alive? I fell on the floor, and I can barely walk. I guess you can just slip and fall off the roof. I fall off roofs all the time. Helen, your story checks out. I'm so glad you're okay. Did-did you mean that stuff you said up there? Uh, yeah? Well, I think you're great and have pretty good collarbones, and if you ever took off that hat, I bet you've got a forehead that goes all the way back. Aw. So sweet. Let's get you inside. Yeah. Hey, look a mud box. Hey, Henry, I found something. I see you did. Some crappy tool box. I know why you buried this. You do? Because you didn't want Teddy to think you had tools, so he'd come over and fix stuff. Right. Because you like him. I do. It's okay. I won't tell anybody about your secret tools. You know, I don't think you're gonna remember any of this anyway. Yeah. Let's go inside. We're not inside? So listen, honey, next time you're in town, you and, uh, Teddy come by, have dinner at the restaurant, on us. What?  Well, I'd like that very much. What kind of restaurant is it? Slop shop. Butt hut. It's nice. I am in. Perfect! I'll go there now and wait. What a wonderful little adventurecation! Oh, I hurt so much. Take it easy, killer! Ha! Killer. Okay, see you soon! Helen, another pill. Be safe! Give me another pill. Here you go. Buh-bye! Thank you. LINDA: Don't kill anyone! Nah, you got it! What a sweetheart. Ooh, let's go break into someone's lake house.  I'm falling for Helen   And there's no tellin'   Just how far a fella can fall   For sure-fitted, strong-armed, wild-eyed widow like Helen   Buh, buh-dah-dah, buh-duh   There's no tellin'   Just how far a fella can fall   For a pill-poppin', home-wreckin'   Long-necked widow like Helen   Bah, bah-dah-dah, bump-ba   I'm falling for Helen   Bah, da, bah-dah-dah, ba, bup"
"Hey, little guy, you're gonna become part of a great burger today. I'm honored. What are you calling it? Jicama-Tah-Ta. Great joke! No making the food talk, please. And you wonder why I'm the only one who'll go shopping with you. Dad, look! Wait, don't look now. Okay, now look. Where? There. Wh-What is it? An old Asian man? That's not an old Asian man. It's not? It's Hawk! Hawk? Hawk! From Hawk & Chick! Father, look out! The Jellyfish Monster! Thank you, Chick.   Hi-yah! Father-daughter samurai team played by an actual father and daughter. It's like they based it on us. I know. We could sue. We won't, 'cause we love these movies. But yeah, that's us. But is he the right age? How old was he in his last movie? The one where they fight the giant butterfly? Yeah. Probably 40. And how old is that guy, a hundred? He's not a hundred. Well, you're 80, so he's got to be at least 90. What's he doing in our dumb town, anyway? Maybe he flies from Japan to buy our mushrooms? He's leaving the market. Should I shout his name? No. We should leave him alone. Or we could follow him. We kind of already are. This is weird. Let's go home, live our lives the best we can. I mean, we're poor, but we're happy. He's crossing the street! Move! Move! Sorry. Thank you. Ooh! Sorry. Sorry. No! He's getting on a bus! Well, we're not getting on a bus to follow this guy. We should get off at the next stop. It's not him. It's him! It's Rising Hawk. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where the hell are your father and your sister? They should be back by now. Maybe they're afraid to be around me. 'Cause I'm on fire. Game, set, salt. Wow. She can't do long division, but the girl can slide a saltshaker. Who? Oh, me. I'm gonna say something. What are you gonna say? Say it to me like you're gonna say it to him. Okay, all right. Um, hi, Mr. Kojima Terrible. What? Ugh! Bad. Right, right, right. Not ready. Not ready.   Fourth floor. Yeah. Stairs. Let's go. Wait, this is crazy. What's our plan? Um, get him to sign your jicama? I don't I don't have a pen. Why are you follow me? Aah! Joking! Joking! Oh. Oh, that-that's good. Y-You got us. Did I get you? Yeah, very much. My little heart is beating so fast. Yeah. I dropped my jicama. Uh, so Shinji Kojima? Please, call me Kojima or Koji. Just don't call me if I owe you money. I owe people money. Uh, uh, my name is Bob. Uh, and this is my daughter, Louise. We've seen all your movies. Am I screeching? I feel like I'm screeching a little. Yes. Sorry, you're kind of a big deal for us. It's nice to get recognized. We were wondering why are you in our town? Did you get lost? Lots of people are here because they got lost. Not lost. Just looking Okay. Wait, what-what does that mean? You kind of trailed off there. I have, uh, said too much. So, do you know a good place to eat? Yes! Uh, we have a restaurant. No, no, no, no! It's not good! It's really good. It's not good enough for Koji, Dad! Is it good or not good? Good. Not good. Good. Oh, not good. Mmm! Good. Wow, so that's how celebrities chew their food. I was all wrong. Celebrity Chewing! I'd watch that show. Tina, take another picture of me with Koji. Let's do one where we're laughing at a hilarious thing I just said. But it's so smart you don't get it for a second, and then you do. Hmm. Mmm? Oh, now I get it. Oh, he just got it. He just got it. When I'm famous, I'll have a handler whose only job will be to keep people like Mom away from me. And Mom, too, maybe. What? Just kidding. You know you'll live in my trailer. I want a copy of that one. Oh, we don't print our photos. They live in the camera. Guys, here it is! All the Hawk & Chicks we recorded from TV. We've got a lot to choose from. Hawk & Chick versus Sharkman or the classic Hawk & Chick versus Tsukumogami. What's a Tsukumogami? Um, it's just an object that comes to life every hundred years. Oh! And in this case, it's a tree. So, they fight a tree? Cool. Well, there's more to it than that, Tina. It's about a barber and his daughter traveling from village to village, trying to avoid trouble But trouble always finds them. And then they kick trouble's ass! Am I right? Looking at you, Koji. Looking back at you, Louise. Wait, so these movies are about traveling barbers who fight weird Japanese monsters? So, it's like a less sexual Incredible Hulk? Hmm? That's not a tree. That's a monster. This is amazing. We're watching a Hawk & Chick with Hawk! I know, and he must be excited 'cause he's watching it with us. Or not. He's crying. Oh. Everything okay, Kojima? No. Not okay. The reason I'm in your town is to find my Yuki. Is that Japanese for getting your groove back? No. It is English for getting my daughter back. Yuki? Your daughter lives here? Yes, she does. I haven't gathered the courage to speak to her. I haven't spoken to Yuki in 30 years. Hawk and Chick haven't spoken in 30 years?! What the hell? She chose to move to America with her mother after we divorced. Our relationship was strained because I strained it. Now Yuki is an accountant. What?! Oh, nice. I've come all this way, but I worry Yuki doesn't want to see me. Eh, what's 30 years? I got underwear older than that. You two will be sword-fighting together in no time. We've got to make this samur-ight! Whoa! I've got a great idea you're all gonna hate. Family conference. Don't worry. Doesn't seem rude. No, no. Maybe all we need to do is get Yuki to see her dad as Hawk again. Up on the big screen! Okay, but how do we do that? I'm really enjoying this huddle. One of the best huddles ever. It's all right. Guys, this is the part you're gonna hate. We got to put on a Hawk & Chick film festival and convince them both to go. Reunion! Boom! You hate it, you hate it. I don't hate it. I like it. I love it. I love it, too. Oh! You snuck in the huddle! I am out of ketchup. But I am in for the festival.  Samurai festival of love.  So, you want me to let you guys take over the theater for the entire weekend for a marathon of some obscure samurai movies from the '70s. Is that right? Yup. So we're good here? Not gonna happen. But the stars of the movies are gonna be there. Most likely. Well, one is for sure. Point is they're gonna reunite in front of all their fans! Father and daughter together again What-what are you doing? Oh, this? Nothing. Keep talking. Can you still hear me? It's a little crack now. I'm just gonna close this down, and bye! Great. Thank you. Thank you! Come on, Louise. Let's go. Psst. Hey. Me. I'm talking. Is Shinji Kojima really in town? And Yuki? Yeah! Wait, so you know the Hawk & Chick movies? I love them! Lots of people do. If you did a Hawk & Chick film festival, people would definitely show up. So, can you talk your boss into letting us use this theater? No. We've had bad experiences doing film festivals. We had a Meg Ryan film festival, and this place was disgusting afterwards. Oh, well, we tried. Thanks. Wait, wait, wait. You can do the festival here. We just got to be sneaky. Like a coyote. Oh, I like the sound of this. Listen, the last show on Saturday night lets out at 11:00. Once my manager drives off, the theater's ours. It'll be a secret, one night only, midnight screening of a Hawk & Chick movie. Okay, we'll do it. Yes! Thanks, Dominic. You're all right. So which Hawk & Chick movies do you have prints of? ""Prints""? Yeah, you know, a print? Thing that goes in the projector? Makes pictures on the screen? Oh, we don't have one of those. No, we just thought we could bring our VHS tapes and just fast-forward through the commerci Okay, I realize how terrible that sounds. Hmm, maybe I can find one. All right, you know, I'll poke around on some film forums. You're lucky I was planning to go online today. Ooh, exciting! An illegal samurai film festival! I like all those words! Now all we need is a movie. And we got to convince Yuki to want to reunite with her father, who she might hate. And we need flyers! But how do we advertise a secret film screening? Psst. You like movies? Yeah, I like movies. Are you cool? What do you mean? Forget it! Keep moving. How's it going? Some of these people seem cool, but they're not! How can you tell? You can tell. So, uh, trash can? No. I think we owe it to an old Japanese man and his middle-aged daughter to see this through. Wow, that just got me. Let's try the quad at the community college. There's two things those honkys love foreign films and flyers telling them where other honkys will be! Well, this is the address Kojima gave us. That's her! That's Chick! It's so gross to see her behind a desk. She should be slicing up the Snow Monster or the Six-Headed Sumo! God, idiot! Please don't call her an idiot to her face. Just get it out now. Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! All right, let's go get Yuki to say yes to the fest. No. What? Look, I haven't even thought about those movies in years. Okay, okay, we're giving you a chance to feel like a movie star again. You can see yourself up on the big screen instead of staring at that number screen on your desk there. I'm very happy as an accountant. No, you're not. I am. You're depressed. No, I'm not. You didn't let me finish! ""ing"" me. Depressing me! Louise? I mean, who makes 14 amazing movies with their dad, and then just walks away one day?! Who does that, Yuki? Louise, stop. Who does that?! Louise? I'm sure it wasn't easy working with your dad all those years. I-I know. I get it. I've been there. Wrong. Wrong! Working with your dad is fun. I mean working with your dad was fun. Because he was a samurai and you killed monsters! Yuki, um, can we have a minute, please? Look, Louise, she obviously doesn't want to reconnect with her father. We should call off the screening. What? No way! We need to get her butt into that theater so she can apologize to Koji. I think it's more like Kojima needs to apologize to Yuki for driving her away. Yuki didn't want his life, Louise! So we're in agreement. We're not gonna tell her that her dad's here! Wait. What? We're gonna trick her. We are? Shh, shh, shh! Here she comes. So, about that film festival can we put you down as a ""yes""? I'm not so sure. Yuki, Yuki, come on, Yuke. Just say yes. Imagine a packed theater of your adoring fans all there for you! Just you, no Hawk. It'll be Chick's night. We love you, Yuki! Ah! Ah! What is? She's doing a like, a lot of people cheering, but it sounds more like a ghost. Well, you do it, Dad. Can you do it. I guess that could be fun. All right, what the hell. I'll go. Great! Great! - So you got her to come? - Yup. That's great. Mm-hmm. Did you use my icebreaker? Pretend to rob the place? No. Did you file for an extension on your taxes? No, Tina. That's a myth. You can't do that. Well, how does Yuki feel about seeing her father? We might not have told her that her dad was gonna be there. On purpose by accident. What? Yup. Nice. You tricked her! Yup. I'm not sure you can trick people into reuniting. Not true. That's how they got Mel Gibson and Danny Glover back together for Lethal Weapon 3. Yeah, I read that. This is gonna work, people. Yuki's gonna see Hawk & Chick up on the big screen, get all weepy like Koji did, and realize how crazy she's been, and we're gonna be heroes, and we're gonna be invited to the premiere of their next movie in Japan! Ooh, I got to get a passport. Guess who got the print. Me! I freaking love this guy! Dominic! Ah, come here. Which one is it? Hawk & Chick versus Seaweed Monster. Ooh, Seaweed Monster, scary! Only thing it's an original 35 millimeter print from Japan. That's incredible. No, I mean, original, vintage. It's not dubbed in English. It's not even subtitled. Oh. Yeah. Well, so, can't you just whip up Oh, sure. Yeah, I'll just add some words to the screen. What do you think this is, future world? I have an idea not about this. Okay, wait. No, I got one about this, too. I have, like, six ideas. The third one's about this. Dubbing it ourselves? Great idea. Thanks, Gene. Guys. All right, I typed up from Hawk & Chick versus Seaweed Monster. Did you guys know about spell check? It's amazing. It tells you if you misspell something. I mean, it's Some of it is open to interpretation. But, you know, it's helpful. Here's everyone's parts. How many characters are you playing? Three. Ah, three's good. I'm doing four characters, but I guess, you know, I'm more experienced. But I've got a lot of lines because I'm the mayor. You're the mayor?! Bob, she's the mayor?! Lin, it doesn't matter. Tina, Tina, let me be the mayor. Back off. Let's dub, people! Rub a dub dub! It has been many days since we have loaned you our lantern. Can we have it back now? Yes. I see you are returning the lantern with less lantern oil than when I lent it to you. Also, the wick is in need of replacement. Lot of lantern talk. There's always a lot of lantern talk. You get into it. Already there. As the mayor of this village As the mayor of this village Mom, back off. Seriously. All right, don't forget, secret screening, so we cannot look like a line! The manager's gonna come out pretty soon and go home. We're just 40-some-odd people who happen to be standing here. So, look at your phones or up at the sky and whistle or something. Oh. Okay. Like this? Great. Wait, wait. Too many shoe tie-ers, One of you hail a cab. Taxi! What do I do? Commit, commit, get in, circle the block. Hello. Right this way, talent. I can't believe I agreed to this. Are those from my rose bush? Shh, shh. Tonight, you're a celebrity again. You don't have a worry in the world. Well, I'm worried about my roses. They're fine. They're fine. They're resilient! Hi, Yuki! Belcher family limo at your service! You'll notice a bottle of water on your seat. That's for you, because celebrities gets thirstier than normal people. The cheese sticks hidden in the seat uh, those are not for you. I will now put up the privacy divider for the remainder of your ride. Okay, he's gone. Get 'em in! Get 'em in! Oh, crap, they're early! Aw, crap, we're early! They can't see each other yet! I know! First Yuki's got to watch the movie, feel bad and want to repair their relationship! I know! Our perfect plan! Flawless! We got to get him inside! Koji, come on. But I am giving Kevin an autograph. Ugh. Forget Kevin. Inside, now, let's go! Gene! Privacy screen! Get in there! Ah! Aah! Ow! Aah! You need privacy! Be private! We got to move! Let's move! Ow, you hit me. That was Kevin. Kevin, get away! Get away, Kevin! Ah, you got me away! Watch out for the Ugh! Ow! Okay, privacy's over. You had some you time. Thanks. Okay, we'll come and get you when it's about to start! Wait. Why can't I go in now? Yeah, just relax and enjoy the green room. Sorry it's not actually green, or a room. You may have one cheese stick! Okay, just sit here and be quiet. And keep the jacket on your head till the movie starts. It's very cold in here. Okay. Got it. No problem. Enjoy the movie, lady! You're in it! And here's some tissues. They're good for when something life-changing happens. All right, here we go. It was a time in Japan when evil monsters would attack nice little villages for no good reason. And the only force in all of Japan who could stop them Hawk & Chick! There's a village up ahead. Maybe there's hair that needs cutting. And hopefully, no monsters that need defeating. This is amazing! I know! We're incredible. We really are. Oh, no, seaweed monster! You're ruining my haircut, and I'm the mayor! Aah! Seaweed monster, let me go! So, you loving the movie? No. Not really. It's kind of painful? Uh-huh. You want some popcorn? Sure. It is finally dead. Father! It's not all dead! : Part of it still wishes to fight. That's not how I sound. Is that how I sound? No! Oh, God, I think the batteries are dying! But we put new batteries in this morning! How could this happen? Fast-forward! Rewind! Fast-forward! Rewind! Fast-forward! Rewind! Well, it's not that bad. Maybe no one will notice. Let's send this thing back to the Okay, that's really bad. We got to do something! There's a mic. I think we got to wing it. Good thing we've seen this movie a thousand times. Aah! Aah! No longer will you terrorize this town, Seaweed Monster. We are going to weed you out! Crap, we need the villagers! Lin! Lin! Psst! We need you guys up here. What? Come here! Hurry! Which way did the Seaweed Monster go? That way! No, that way! Aah! Monster! Green! Green! Aah! Aah! I can't do this. Oh, God, she's leaving! Yuki's leaving! Oh, I forgot to tell you, your plan's not working. She's having a terrible time. She told me. I thought the popcorn would make her feel better, but it didn't. Hang on, it's my line. Don't hurt me. I'm the mayor. Don't hurt me. I'm the mayor. Mom! Damn it, Yuki, you're killing me! What do we do? What do we do?! Wait. Yuki, don't go! Huh? I mean, Chick. I know we're fighting this Seaweed Monster right now, but I want you to know how much I love and support you, even if you decide Hold on. Hiya! Aah! to stop fighting monsters with me someday and do taxes instead. And, Hawk, I want you to know hiya! if that ever happens, it's me who should apologize for leaving! 'Cause I would be dumb to do that. I don't remember this part. Are the actors really bad? Yes. They're horrible. No! Smash this house! Chick doesn't need to apologize for anything! Chick was just a kid! And I hit this guy! But but how could a father and daughter not talk for 30 freaking years?! Whoa. Seaweed Monster suddenly thinks this might be about something else. And I'm squeezing you. Sorry about that. Am I gonna turn into someone completely different someday? Is that what happens when you grow up? You you grow apart? Listen, what happened to Hawk and Chick will never happen to us. This Hawk and this Chick will never not talk for 30 years. You promise? Yes, of course, Louise. I mean, Chick. Foreign films are so much more complex than Hollywood movies. I'm the monster again. Aah, I'm getting stabbed. I'm getting I exploded. I'm not sure why I I explo I'm dead. I'm gone. Koji, talk to her. To who? To Yuki. My Yuki. Yuki, it's it's your father speaking. Dad? What are you doing here? You said he wasn't gonna be here. You tricked me. Uh, surprise. Yuki, please, I've come all this way to tell you I miss you. I am sorry for everything. I have not been a good father. Oh, she's thinking about it. I love you, little Chick. Oh, Dad. Oh, he got her.

"Everybody, please! Everybody, let's try to settle down. I mean, a rent hike? Now? Come on! Fischoeder's out of his freaking mind. What are we supposed to do, jack up the price of yarn? There'll be riots! Again! I'm starting to think Mr. Fischoeder just became a landlord for the money. Everyone, can I can I have your attention? Silence! Yeah, tubby's talking! Mr. Fischoeder has raised our rent before, but this new hike is the biggest ever. None of us can afford it. Except for me, right, son? What? Ah, never mind. What? Never mind. I told Mr. Fischoeder we were coming to see him today, but what he doesn't know is if he goes ahead with this rent hike, we're gonna give him a rent strike! Yeah! A what? A rent strike. It means if Mr. Fischoeder tries to raise the rent, we'll stop paying it. Oh, that might make him mad, Bobby. Yeah, landlords hate stuff like that. Exactly. It's the only leverage we have against a guy as big as Fischoeder. : You sure you want to be the ringleader on this, Bob? You know, it could be better to talk to him one-on-one. He's not our friend, Lin, he's our landlord. We have to show him we mean business. Mmm, Bobby Business over here. I like Bobby Business. Okay, Bob, we're in. Yay, Bobby, you're going on a rent strike! Just like in Rent. Uh, I don't think that's what happens in Rent. No, yeah, that's what happens. Now you smile. Now you smile. Now you smile. Now you smile. Stop it, stop it. Did we really have to bring our kids? Did you really have to wear that tie? It's important to show Fischoeder that we're not just doing this for ourselves. Some of us have families. Aw, I love kids. Which is ironic, 'cause they're not allowed in my store. I-I run a sex shop, everybody. If we haven't met, I'm Sal. Pervert. Hey, Sal. Uh, yeah. Uh, thanks for coming, Sal. Remember, everybody, stick to the script. Rent hike, rent strike. Oh, look! I thought I heard the pitter-patter of little tenant feet. Everyone, have a welcome mojito! Wow, mojitos. This is going good, Bobby. Mojito, Bob? Uh, not for me, thanks. Oh, nonsense. It's mojito weather. I don't want a-a mojito. Linda, mojito? Sure! Attagirl. Mr. Fischoeder, we've prepared a few words for you. Just, um, give me a second. I'm gonna put the mojito down. Oh, well, that's a safe place to put it. The dictionary defines ""rent"" as a This is an old draft. Uh, let me just skip ahead. Here we go. It was Gandhi who said Let me stop you right there, Bob Gandhi would want me to. You're here to tell me that if I raise the rent, you'll have a rent strike. How did you know? Whenever tenants get together in these little clumps, you come up with the same idea. Well, it's true if you raise the rent, we're, um, we're gonna strike. Right, everyone? Oh, but, Bob, and, uh, loyal, uh Bob-ists? Bob-ites? Whatever you want to call yourselves. I'm here to tell you there's another way. Another way? Yes. Carnies? I don't get it. A water balloon fight! Excuse me? I said a water balloon fight. It's how we settle worker disputes on the wharf. Well, that and freestyle rap battles. You may use the entire grounds of my estate, from the garden I ignore to the field in the back where I dump the old rides. Uh, I don't think that's gonna happen. If you get hit, you're out. And that means your rent is going up. Listen, Mr. Fi B-But for the lucky winner who manages to stay dry, your rent gets cut in half. All right! I could use that money to buy things. Now, what do you say? N-No. We came here to stand together, not Hold on, now. If any member of my family wins, my rent goes down? Yes. Children flank their parents in battle just like in the good old days. Oh, so people with kids have an unfair advantage. Would you call that an advantage? Giddyup! I'm okay. Mr. Fischoeder, we're not doing your water balloon fight. We're standing together. Right? Here's how we're gonna do this. You grab as many balloons as you can, find cover, and at the sound of my pistol, start ballooning. Every man for himself! Go! Jimmy, what are you doing?! I'm getting 50% off my rent! Don't move, Bob! Stay where I can balloon ya! No. No, stand together. Rent hike means rent strike! Linda, wait. Guys! Teddy? I'm with you, Bobby. I'm just gonna get a balloon real quick, 'cause everyone else is getting balloons. Rent hike means rent No! Oh, but the gun says yes. Kids, stay away from the water balloons! Oh, right, Dad, like you can just tell kids, ""Stay away from the water balloons."" Sorry, Bob. Tenant clump un-clumped. Now it's every honky for himself. Everyone, focus. Fischoeder is using this to divide us. People, if we play his game, there are many losers and only one winner. And that winner's gonna be me! Reggie, no. Sorry, Bob. I'm always the doormat, but not this time. I'm gonna win this thing and Ah, come on. Gotcha. That was for you, Bob. Ah, geez. Am I out? I'm out. Good throw, Zeke. Thanks, J-Ju. So do we have an alliance? Hell yeah. I'm the Katniss to your Pita Bread. Carnies, seize them! Wha? What are you? Help! I'll never forget you, Bob! Where are they taking them? To the porch of losers. When you're hit, you go up on the porch and watch the rest of the competition and have snacks. Ooh, snacks. Snacks? - Teddy! - Eh? What kind of snacks? Uh, cheese and French bread. Ooh. TEDDY: Little shrunken pickles. You're missing out. Oh, my God, I'm so hungry. Dad, you got to take cover. You're a high-value target in a low-value body. All right, Gene and I will form a strike team and go soak some suckers. This is one wet T-shirt contest we don't want to win. No, kids, you're not doing that. You guys stay close while I talk to the tenants and get them back together. And they're gone. Don't worry, Dad. You still have me and Mom. We're like the Secret Service, Bob. We'll never leave your side. I'm just gonna get a few little shrunken pickles. Mom, no. Oh, right, right, right. People, you're being dumb! I'm sorry to be harsh, but it's tough love. ""Tough love,"" aka ""love."" Am I right? I'm with you, Bob. This is madness. Yes, thank you, Sal! We got to stay together, like batteries and the things I sell at my store that need the batteries. Great, Sal. Thanks. Oh, Bob's getting his little club back together. Start with the porno guy, that's what they always say. Where's that coming from? By the way, if you need more balloons, I've hidden buckets around the garden. Let's just say one of these trees bears big, wet, jiggly fruit. Uh, apple tree! Pineapple! Raisin tree! No guessing from the porch of losers. Look, it's Harold and Edith. Whoa, that tree house is nicer than our house. That tree is nicer than our house. Okay, you hit Edith, I'll hit Harold, then we'll climb up and see how rich squirrels live. Ready? Hi-ya! Man, that old prune can throw a balloon. There's more where that came from, baby! Harold, defend the perimeter! Huh? Wha? Oh, all right. Retreat! Retreat! Bob. I got an idea. What? We can use my bra as a balloon launcher. Linda, no, we're not throwing balloons. Also, that idea is not good. I think it's genius. It's not genius. Sure, it is! A bazonga bazooka! Ha! Listen, we got to find a protected spot where we can reason with the tenants without getting hit. Dad, look. Oh! It looks like Bob the rat has found the hedge maze. Ugh, he's watching us. We're going somewhere else! Not the hedge maze! Don't listen to him! He's in the hedge maze! Watch your step, Bob. I have a suspicion our maid has been tossing the garbage in there instead of walking it to the curb. You hear that? Inga? Jimmy Jr. And Zeke. You guys keep going. I'll take care of these two. All right, but be careful, Tina. I was born careful. Remember? You were there. Damn, J-Ju. We're out of balloons in a balloon fight worst time to be out of balloons. - Yeah. Where's that balloon bucket? - Boys. Tina! No balloons, huh? I have one. But there are two of you. Hmm. Tina, girl, just let us go. Yeah, let us go! I could. Or I could throw my balloon at you, Zeke and spend some time alone with Jimmy Jr. In this romantic/creepy hedge maze. That'd be okay, yeah. Hold up now, girl. Hold up! Uh, you, uh you know I like you, right? What? I said I like you. A lot. I'm up to my butt in it, T-bird. Come on! Huh. Hell, J-Ju takes you for granted. Zeke! Sorry, J-Ju, it's the truth. Tina, wh-what are you doing? I was just about to ask you on a romantic date! Bull feces! Okay, Jimmy Jr., if I agreed to go on a date with you, where would you take me? Um, to, uh to the drugstore. Ugh. Zeke, can you do better than the drugstore? Do what? Do better than the drugstore! Uh, tacos, then to the touch tank at the aquarium. Check out the octopuses. Get tacos again. Maybe wash it down with some-something to drink. All sorts of good stuff, girl. Jimmy Jr.? Your move. Uh I-I Just so you guys know, I'm not enjoying this. It's very stressful. But let's keep going. We're out in the open, kids. Ready to shield Daddy? Front shield! Back shield! Great. Great. I, uh I love you. Yay! Yay! Shh! Listen, I don't know if anyone can hear me, but we can still turn this around. We just have to stop fighting each other. Me, me, me, me, me, me, fighting each other. Ugh. Jimmy. Hey, uh, sorry this isn't working out for you, pal. Yeah, well, it could still work out, Jimmy. I convinced Sal to stop playing. Oh, Sal, you in there? Yeah. Well, wait, uh, you don't want to win half off your rent? Don't listen to him, Sal. Guys in your line of work are hurting. Are we ever. Damn Internet. Nowadays, people only come into a sex shop if you give 'em a ""boutique experience."" Pshh. Jazz music playing. Oh Huh. They want clean floors now. Oh, disgusting! Poor Sal. Boy, you really need to win this thing, huh? Sal, you see what he's doing, right? No. Oops. I, uh, gently dropped a water balloon on the grass, and it's rolling under the hedge to you, Sal. That's weird. : Throw it at Bob. Throw it at Bob. Don't pick it up, Sal. Come on, kids. Throw it at Bob. Throw it at Bob. Throw it at Bob! Huh! Sal Throw it at Bob! Eh! Throw it at Bob! Huh! Uh-oh, we're losing him. Throw it at Bob! Eh! - Throw it at Bob! - : Sal, no! I'm sorry, Bob and Linda! Linda, are you okay? You blocked that with your face. Yeah. My whole face flashed before my eyes. What is wrong with you people?! They're not listening, Bob. So screw 'em. You got to fight. And I'm gonna have some snacks. Lin, what are you doing? The bazonga bazooka use it. I don't think I will. Bob, listen carefully! You put a balloon in each cup. Pull it back like a slingshot. No, I get it. Aim it slightly up! It's not that complicated. I love you, Bobby. Good luck! She's right. Screw these people. Good news, Mr. Fischoeder! You got me in your balloon fight! And I'm gonna win it! You hear that?! I heard most of it I can't always understand your accent. I don't have an acc I Never mind! Anyway I'm gonna win! I'm playing the game! Is this what you people wanted? Huh? Huh?! Come on out! May I propose an alliance? Ha! - You could've just said no. - Attaboy, Bob! That's the wrong size for you, Dad. But a good color. Did Mom tell you to take her bra and use it as a balloon launcher? Yes. How did you know that? Mom and I have talked through this scenario dozens of times. Take it. I-I don't really want it. Wish me luck, kids! Yeah, okay, luck! Come on, Gene. We're going back to the tree house to take out a couple of old coots. We've got superior firepower. Superior and padded for comfort! ""How do you know when it's the right time to kiss a girl?"" Uh, at breakfast, in the afternoon, in the jungle, when you're married, and at the doctor's. Great answer. Whew, that was tough. Ugh, how long do we have to play this game, Tina? Until I make my decision. Well, it's getting boring! Maybe you just made my decision for me. Uh-oh! You know what? I'm gonna back away. And if you're gonna throw it, go ahead. Don't walk away. It's not walking. It's dancing. It's walking! It's a backward dancy strut. Don't make me do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Damn it, Jimmy! Whoops. Ha-ha! It's my turn now. Uh-oh, Tina! Why'd you say all that stuff, Zeke? Why'd you tell Tina I've had work done? It's not true! Oh, like you were born with that nose. You're the one with the perfect lips! Where'd you get those?! Hey, I have an idea. Why don't you throw it at Tina, and we'll be friends again. No, I'm not sure I like that idea. Hey, look, a hedge! Bye! I think we were all winners here. Aah! I'm afraid of heights! You're on the first step. You look like an ant from here! Why do you think they want to get up there so bad? You want the high ground in a balloon fight. Edith would know that. She fought the dinosaurs. Come on, help me tie Mom's bra to a tree. Then let's tie my underwear to a bird. Get back on that ladder, Harold. You're not having a heart attack. You've never had a heart attack. I did once. That was a stroke, if you could even call it that, you big baby. Okay, ready for launch. This is it. Let's make ""Double D"" stand for doused and dampened. Oh! Aah! Damn! Wow. I did not expect that to work. Wait till the Army hears about this. It's everything we've ever wanted! Can we get our mail here? Tree mail! Tree cable! Uh, hello? Felix? Do you live here? Uh, yes. My brother kicked me out of the main house because I have sleep apnea, and sleep fartnea. Look! Balloons! Of course! ""One of these trees bears wet, jiggly fruit."" That is a weird thing to say. Oh, my God, balloons! Let's play! Kids? Kids?! Dad? Good, you got the high ground! Okay, wait for my signal. We're gonna pound these punks! Whoa. Who's the new guy?  Would you like to ride   In my beautiful balloon?   Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?   We could float among the stars together, you and I   Oh, we can fly   Yeah, we can  It's Bobby and Tina! It's just the Belchers and the Pestos now. Go, Bobby, go! Ooh, salami! Who catered this? Jimmy, come out. This ends now! Tina! Hey, you broke my balloon! Well, at least it was fair and square. In my back when I wasn't looking. Give up, Bob. I've got more balloons than you, and I've got boy shields. Hi, Louise and Gene and Tina's Dad! Back shield, ease up on my throat! Sorry! You may have boy shields, Jimmy, but I have boy and girl snipers! I said I have boy and girl snipers! These are dolls and a tree house for the dolls to play in. Mmm. Oh, whoa, whoa, careful, please. They're made to look like antiques. Snipers! Shoot him! Oh, crap. Oh, they're too far away. Mom's bra doesn't have that kind of range. I guess Mom's never really had to launch her boobs very far. Uh, do you want to use this maybe? Uh, yeah! Why do you have this? It's how I send my dirty laundry over to the main house. Load it up! Quick! Ha! You only got my kids, idiots! All right, Bob Wait. Good-bye kiss! Good-bye kiss! Oh, God. Okay, okay, okay, go, go, go, go! Let's see if you can dodge this. Son of a bitch! Sorry, Dad. Yeah, sorry. All right, all right. Easy now, easy now. Uh, Bob? What's the problem? Yeah, quit hot-dogging and do it already. This is the last balloon. Yes, yes, yes. Get to it, you grandstanding foreigner. No, I have the last balloon. That means the game doesn't end till I say it does. You all have to listen to me! Ha-ha! We were gonna work together, but no! You wanted to play this stupid game, and now you all lose! Oh, someone's a sore winner. What made me think people coming together could accomplish anything? People are the worst! Coming together is the worst! Are you finished yet? No! As long as I have this balloon, you will hear me! I will be heard! Damn it. Well, let's call that a tie. How about this? New game. Everybody get Bob. What? That's right. Each time anyone hits Bob with a balloon, they get $50 off their rent, and, uh, Bob gets $50 added. What?! How do I win? Uh, uh, you have to last until sundown. That's when the game ends. And Inga and I watch World's Craziest Car Chases. Ready, everyone? Wait! No, no, no, no, no! Bob, you have ten seconds to run. Ten, nine, eight, six, one. Go! Help! Leave Bob alone! This is how they want to play it? Felix, do you have any more dirty clothes? How dirty we talking? Wow me. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I'll try to keep this briefs. Go, Bob! Go! Whoa. I'm gonna look over here! Oh, I got to hide. - Where are you? - Got a balloon for you. Wow, Dad might just make it through this thing. It's almost sundown. It's almost sundown? I didn't bring my evening face cream. Where do you think Dad is hiding? And did that pig just fart? Hi, Dad. You farted. It was the seat. Go away! Get in the pig with you? You got it. No, you guys are gonna draw attention. I can win this thing if I just lay low for another 20 minutes. So you're saying we better get comfortable? No, no, no, no! Bob? You over there, buddy? It's not safe here. I have to make a run for it. Dad, running's not your thing. Do you have a plan that involves standing around all the time? You're right. Dad can't move very well. Thanks, Tina. But maybe we can move Dad. Push harder! Yes. That's great! That could work! He's over there! Get him! Bob? Oh, God. Oh, God. Back off, you maniacs! Leave my Bobby alone! Step aside, Linda. Make me, Reggie! Come on, sandwich man, you want to dance?! Get back! That pig up there is our father! And our dad's in there! We didn't come this far to not throw balloons at Bob. Move, please. Okay. You know what? Fine. You want to win money off your rent? Be my guest. Uh, Linda? It's over, Bob. You're getting ballooned. What do you got, 50 balloons? A hundred? That sounds high. Our rent's gonna be nuts. We'll go out of business, live in a box. You kids are gonna have to work in factories. I want to work at C&C Music Factory! Linda, what are you doing? Zip it, Bob! You had it coming after everything you did. You brought everyone together, looked out for 'em, stood up for what's right. Oh, I see what you're doing. Go ahead, destroy everything this family's worked for. Oh, goodie! I'm just in time. Looks like Bob is about to be ballooned. Direct hits only, people. No splash, no cash. Horrible aim. What's wrong with you people? Must be a case of mass butterfingers. We're standing with Bob. Yeah, just like before, but this time for real. Right, Jimmy? Ah, I wanted to throw a balloon at Bob. It's fine. I'll throw something at him later. Maybe a meatball. Thanks, everyone. Rent hike, rent strike! Rent hike, rent strike! Oh, I get it. Just because I'm a landlord, and I wear a white suit and an eye patch, and I raise your rent and ride around and throw firecrackers at you, I'm the bad guy. Well, landlords have problems. Landlords have problems. So long. See? My golf cart loses its charge just like yours. Oh. Mr. Fischoeder, I-I just realized something. Is is it okay if I sit? Mm. People are staring. Mr. Fischoeder, before I got all these people together, maybe I should have come to you first and talked to you one-on-one. Mm. I should have given you a chance to be the good guy. Mm. I've known you a long time, and I just realized now I might have hurt your feelings. Here's the thing, Bob. I like you. You're good people, sort of. You don't have to say ""sort of."" And I've always thought of myself as the kind of landlord you could pal around with. Someone you could pat on the butt as a sign of affection. That would I I would do that. No, but don't touch me. The truth is, Bob, I was only raising the rent so you would notice me. Really? No. I wanted a pool. You can't get chicks with a hedge maze. Sure. Makes sense. Bob, I've reconsidered. Maybe I could postpone the pool and the rent hike for a year or two. You'll be out of business by then, Bob, don't worry. Thank you, Mr. Fischoeder. I know exactly how we should celebrate. Don't hit my pants! I'm wearing white. You'll see the outline of my wiener. Oh, what the hell. Fire away!  99 red balloons   Floating in the summer sky  panic bells, it's red alert   something here from somewhere else   the war machine springs to life   opens up one eager eye   focusing it on the sky   where 99 red balloons go by   99 red balloons go by   99 red balloons go by."
"You're watching bob's burgers. Catch all-new episodes sundays and check out our other fox programs-- The simpsons, family guy and brooklyn nine-nine. Help me with that pigeon head. I can't see anything. Only on fox. Faster! Faster! Gene, stop whipping me with a tube sock. Well, sorry I don't have dress socks. Keep going, dad. You're almost at the water station. Oh, my god. Yay, dad! You're peddling like crazy And not getting anywhere. Just like your life. Great encouragement, kids! And Good enough. Oh! Now, hit the showers, sweat stuff. And wash this sock. It's got your stank all over it. Boy, your father's getting a lot of good out of this Old exer-cycle someone dumped in the alley. Maybe it was a hint from a concerned friend, Like someone anonymously mailing you mouthwash. Yeah, did you like the flavor, by the way? 'cause they also make cinnamon. No, it was really good. Oh Hey! That's weird. So, it looks the same? Yeah, your bald spot is still Exactly the size of the lid Of a mayonnaise jar. Or a tiny crop circle. Huh, I guess it's a mystery. Bob, your mustache! What? You're going lip bald! All right, well, it doesn't look great. Or it's sexy. It shows a little skin, But leaves something to the imagination. ""internet, does my father have mange?"" Maybe I should just shave it off. ""shave it off""?! No, no, no! You can't! Bob, your mustache is like an old friend. It introduced us. It was how we met. Wait, it was how you met? I thought mom lost a bet. Come on, you know this story. I never told you this story? Guys, this is our chance to say ""yes, you did tell us that story."" I was engaged to hugo, But I wasn't that into hanging out with him. Louise: Here we go. So, one night, I was having a quiet cocktail With my friend ginger. So, I said, ""that's not how you throw a shrimp. This is how you throw a shrimp!"" Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh, my god! Hey, you got a lot of nerve Grabbing girls' diamond rings With your thick, luxurious, Tom selleck-ian mustache. Hi. Hi. Uh, my eyes are up here. Should we get some scissors? What's the rush? What do you mean? Oh, I Sorry. One thing led to another, and, uh, I gave hugo Back his ring and told him I met a mustache. Whoa! So if dad didn't have his mustache that day, You guys don't click, don't get together, We're not born. a world without a gene Is not a world I want to live in! Oh, please. Mom and dad are destined To get together no matter what. It's called fate and it's great. That's an easy way to remember it. No, no, no, no. Shave dad's face, Belcher kids are erased. If dad's lip has no hair, We never come out of there. Well, we'll never really know what would've happened If I didn't have a mustache back then. But we can wildly speculate. No. I don't want to do that. I take you back to that night. Everything is the same Almost! ""that's not how you throw a shrimp. This is how you throw a shrimp!"" Dad's naked lip is no match For a small karat, visibly occluded, rose-cut diamond. You know a weird amount about diamonds. A boy can plan for his big day! Ow! Oh, oh, god! Sorry. Uh-oh! Got a little blood. Uh, let me get you a napkin. Aah! There you go. All better. Oh, wait, no. It's gushing. Oh, no! Oh, god. Oh, god! Oh, god Doctor: I don't really like the sight of blood, either. It's like, what is that stuff?! Hi, doc. Sergeant bosco, pd. What do you got-- lip job? Um, it's a simple laceration. Just a couple of stitches should do it. He could be perfect. You're losing him! I'm losing him? Wait, you're losing me? He's flatlining! you're making that sound. Induce coma! Induce coma?! I'm commandeering this patient. Wait! Let's talk about-- Oh, god Technician: Powering up. He's on. How are you feeling? I don't feel. What do you remember? Nothing. Correct response. The os is loaded. Welcome to the force, officer robo 'stache. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Lin! I'm just giving you a little comb-over. Ugh. Gene, why would the police give me a robotic mustache? Because they tried robotic ding-dongs, and they were buggy. Sure, sure. But the mustache unit was bristling With state-of-the-art technology. .45-caliber revolver, tear gas, paper shredder, Universal remote, pencil sharpener, Toothpick, melon baller. Robo 'stache, you are fully trained. We've uploaded police academy to your brain. The movies and the actual training. They are funny, except for 5: Assignment: Miami beach. That is correct. What are your directives? Serve the public, protect the innocent. Dance like no one's watching. And a fourth hidden secret one I'm not allowed to know about But shouldn't concern me in the slightest. Perfect. Now hit the streets! The new broom on dad's lip Swept the city clean. Hold it, punk. Hold it, pug. Drop the loot, scum. It's take-a-penny, leave-a-penny! More like take-a-tase, take-a-tase. Indecent exposure! Ow, my butt cheeks! Why would you do that? So, I'm kind of nitpicky as a cop. No, you're not good. Just keep going, gene.  I'm engaged to hugo!   is that good? I don't know!  Public nuisance detected!  as long as I don't think about it   too much, yeah  beanbag deployed.  I  aah! Oh, my mouth! Hey, it's you! You a cop now? You look different with that mustache. You look good! Compliment accepted. I'll pass that along to my supervisors. They'll be jazzed. You have the right to buy me a cup of coffee. Please don't use cute cop speak. It's not cute. So tell me about yourself. There's not much to tell. My ding-dong is not robotic. They are buggy. Oh. Gene! It was bound to come up! See, gene? You couldn't stop fate even in your own story. Dad has a mustache, and he and mom are hitting it off Like peanut butter and jerry. You know, that kid from school Who has peanut butter every day? Jerry? Uh, uh, uh, don't get attached, Because not everyone lives-- hint, hint. No! I can't get over how handsome you look now. Thank you. You are the eighth most attractive woman I've seen today. Oh. I arrested seven supermodels. Oh! I mean prostitutes. Oh. Of all the women who are not supermodel-prostitutes, You are the most attractive. Aw. How about I give you a little kiss? For free, right? Mmm. you zapped me! This is how you throw a shrimp. We've met before. I know! That's why, when I saw you, I said, ""hey, it's you!"" You can say that to anyone. It's always true. What happened to you? I don't know, but I have some questions. Robo 'stache had some questions. Who is bob belcher? His name is written in my underwear. Bob belcher? He's one of your parts. Like a screw, but not as fancy as a screw. Ouch. You mind turning the voltage down on the mustache? It's like making out with a wall socket. It's hardwired to his brain. If we do that, I don't know what'll happen, Except that his brain will explode, so power down, or? What?! That's horrible! If you don't like it, Take it up with mr. Fischoeder. He owns the cops. He's, uh, not here right now, but there's a tiny model of him. ""wonder wharfopolis?"" Mr. Fischoeder's dream. Picture this town. Now picture it gone completely. Then picture a giant amusement park as big as a town. Where will people live? The people are in the way! That's why we made tin lip over here. To drive people out with nitpicky policing! The police are just goons for mr. Fischoeder?! Officer bosco, you're under arr-rr Ruh-ruh, uh-ruh Ah, the hidden secret fourth directive: ""never arrest officer bosco."" Oh, that was smart to put in there. Mr. F. Thinks of everything. He's a handsome genius. One more thing. Not only do I work for mr. Fischoeder. I am mr. Fischoeder. Aha! He shouldn't have done that. Now robo 'stache can arrest him! Good, father, good. Mr. Fischoeder, you're under arrest. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Did I not put in ""never arrest mr. Fischoeder""? No. Well, let me just pop this bosco mask back on and, uh let's talk, man to Mm, cyborg. What-what if I could give you a robotic ding-dong? No bugs. Interesting. No, thank you. In that case, I'll have to keep my robo eye on you. The battle was intense. It was like terminator versus roomba. Laser beam! Eye scissors! Tear gas! Stink eye! Toothpick! Pink eye! Melon baller! But robo couldn't handle the big fisch. The pupil becomes the master! System error. Contact mustache administrator. Brain explosion any second, eh Actually, I think I'm fi oh, god. Brain explosion hurts so much. It's like getting water up your nose, but worse. Ugh! Let's get this back on. Oh! One more time. Now I got it. That's upside down. How about you just keep it? Oh, I don't really have a place for it. Well, it's my dying wish, so I guess I could put it on my pet cactus, So it looks like my cactus has a mustache. can you imagine?! Oh, you're dead. Dad was dead. And his mustache was on a cactus. And that is what would've happened, Definitely, for sure. Huh. It really makes you think about stuff. No, dad wouldn't die. Mom and dad would end up together! Also, if they arrested everyone, Who would go to the amusement park? German tourists. Hey, dad, I found something here. ""loss of facial hair can be caused by testicular failure."" Testicular failure? Gee, even your testicles are failures. They're trying. Let's just change the subject, please. Sure. Sports? What are they? I know what would have happened If dad met mom without a mustache, And it's even more tragic. Guys, why are we doing this? Mom and dad would always, always end up together. Shh, tina. Love at first sight is a powerful thing Between two people. This is how you throw a shrimp! Hi. I'm bob. But usually one of those people will not be into it. Hi. I'm not into it. And then it's not powerful at all. Just sad. And I'm semi-happily engaged. But mom at least had some advice for dad. Look, I'm gonna be blunt. You're a butter lip. You need a little face candy. Cocaine? No I'm talking about a mustache. You know the saying. A gentleman down south, but a bad boy above the mouth? I don't know that saying, But if I had a mustache, you'd be into it? Yeah, maybe, but it doesn't matter. I'm only in town for one night, and I'm pretty sure You can't grow a mustache in 24 hours, so, bye. A smarter man would have known he was getting the brush-off, But dad was so hooked on her, and so stupid, He took it as a challenge. Dad tried everything. He rubbed. He glued. He sprayed. There was only one thing left to try-- a wish. I wish I had a must Out of order, buddy! Oh, no! The swami's hand's on the fritz. His middle finger keeps popping up. Not what people are looking for. Well, then, can you grant me a wish? I'm not really qualified. I mean, I'm just the repair guy. I Look, it's an emergency! All right, uh, I'll do it, But if you wish my clothes off, I'm gonna be mad. I-I wish I had a mustache. Uh, your wish is granted. Great, thank you. All right, no guarantees on that. Bad swami. At first, nothing happened. what was I thinking? And then You sweet, magical, fortune-teller repairman. ow. It's real. How'd you do it? Don't worry about the past. Let's just talk about our future. Huh, you got a little soul patch, too. Oh, um, so I do. And kind of a unibrow, how'd I miss that? Giant muttonchops and knuckle afros And a bushel of hair coming out of both ears. And your nose, too. Uh, okay, so should we order? Oh, I'm gonna throw up. What? Waiter! So I'm like a werewolf? That's kind of fun, kind of cool. No, you just have uncontrollable hair growth everywhere. That's not really That's just uncomfortable. Yeah. Don't worry, dad. When you're destined to be together, Uncontrollable hair growth can't stop uncontrollable love growth. Shush, shush, mom was super grossed out, So dad needed to unwish his wish fast, But Oh, crap, the machine's gone. I'm stuck like this forever. Dad was devastated. He slumped away, hairily. Bob, wait; you're a good man, and you did this for me. Let's try to make it work. Are you still gagging? There you are. There he is. You want to see? Oh, so that was a lot of work for nothing. Sorry. Maybe we should just go for a walk. You wanna go for a walk? Do ya? Do you wanna go? Uh, can you not say it like that? He's excited. He heard the ""w"" word. I'm a little excited, but please stop. For a moment there, it seemed Like they had it all figured out. Hey, hair ball, put it in a ponytail, right?! You're shedding all over the sidewalk! shake it off. Let's pick up the pace a little, come on. Cool! You see, that guy gets it. I love it, but society will never accept you he's right. What kind of future could I give you? What can I do with my life, looking like this? You could, uh Uh Uh Nah. Oh!  So I thought I would be an excellent freak In your freak show. Mm-hmm. Any, uh, qualifications? I'm I'm covered in hair. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Education? What? Education? Oh. I Yes, dartmouth. Ooh. Uh, I'm sorry, I lied. I panicked and I lied. I see. Harvard. Oh. I lied again, I don't I I didn't go to college. So you thought you could just grow your hair a little And jump into the freak business, did you? Um These people are professionals. They are trained. Can you hang bricks from your nipples? I I-I don't think I can. You would know. I'm sorry I wasted your time. You know what? You're hired. Wait, that's That's great. You go on in ten minutes. Get the hair dryer! We need a blowout!  Dad lived out the rest of his life as a freak. Mom developed an allergy and left him And became a nun, 'cause she thought It would be like sister act. It wasn't, and they kicked her out. Now she's in jail. The end. Mm. So I have even less dignity in that story. So that's the one we'll accept as true. That's what would have happened. Dad, great news! There's a treatment For your midlife problems: A mustache transplant. ""let our talented doctors take follicles ""from a hairier part of your body And surgically implant them on your lip."" I'm not doing that. But you're the perfect candidate. You have hair everywhere! Back-stache, belly-stache. Hello? Butt-stache! Can we just? Let tina have the floor finally? Yes, because I know that even if there's no mustache that night, Mom and dad would still fall in love Because of fate, which is great! Remember?! This is how you throw a shrimp! Ow! Aah! Done. They're in love. Everyone got that? Everyone clear? Uh That doesn't sound right. Yeah, dad makes a weird noise when he's hurt, And it's not attractive to women or anyone. It scares cats. Huh. Yeah. Um, okay, maybe they start out a little rocky. Hey, crazy arms, take your crazy-arm medication! Looks like you took too much of your medication. Call your doctor If you experience any of these symptoms. Ugly face, dumb face, dumb breath, Donkey neck, weird legs. Weird legs? Only from the waist down. Um, now that they've gotten all that off their chests, Sparks are ready to fly. Oh, boy. I don't think this is getting back on track, t. No, it does. Fate! Destiny! Let's get married and have three kids and live together forever! Okay. Mm Completely unbelievable. Yeah, I don't think so, tina. Mm, nah, that's not the linda I know. Oh, my god, you're right. Dad would have walked out, And they would have been out of each other's lives. And then Huh! Huh! Wha-what? What? Huh! Huh! Huh! What?! It's bad! It's bad! Maybe you're just telling it bad? Don't you see?! If mom and dad don't get together, Mom's engagement to hugo is never broken! Are we ready, darling? So, we're actually doing this? Of course! This isn't the rehearsal anymore? This is the The thing? Hugo grows a mustache for the wedding. It's bushy, and it has it going on. No! It gets worse. They have three children-- mona, dean and charlize. And because mom never breaks up with hugo, He never suffers the tragic heartbreak That turned him into a health inspector. So he's happy, and he pursues his dream of opening A restaurant. Big day today. It's a holiday weekend. All right, let's sell some hot dogs! I got it all, baby! Uh, three kids and a mustache! Nothing missing! Big day for another reason, too, right, linda? It's may 5. Oh, yeah, your height! Yes, my height! Also, cinco de mayo! Also, our anniversary! Right, we got married! I'm so happy. No lingering regret at all! Thank you for the best anniversary! All of you! You're my children, and you're all wonderful. You, mona, with your appropriate level of interest in boys. Boys? Shrug. What else you got? And don't say horses. And dean, my little man. If only I could pull you out of your shell! Dad, please! Stop paying attention to me. I can't bear the spotlight! Sorry for screaming. And little charlize, with your stickers And your princess dolls. Could you be any sweeter? Well, is there anything else I can do To help the family business? Give us a twirl! Whee! You're a monster. It's not me, don't you see? It's what would have happened! And now your mother and I are going downstairs To stuff the sausage. Gross. Okay, that's enough. I wish it was, dad, but there's more. Since you never fell in love with mom, Your life was different, too! Hugo's hot dogs, here we are. You coming, partner? Yes, I'm coming, ron! I have to. I'm a health inspector! It's my job! Free samples! Put your hands on a wiener! No double entendre intended! Hey, I know this building. I tried to rent it 20 years ago, But somebody got in just ahead of me. Oh, and then didn't you go on To have a series of failed restaurants? Yeah. Thanks, ron. Mona, honey, jimmy junior's on the phone. He wants to take you to the new zombie movie tonight. Ugh. Jimmy junior? Zombies? maybe in a parallel universe. Hello, we're here to inspect you. Whee! I'm princess spins-around! That doesn't sound like a real princess. Shut up! I Sir? Ma'am? Oh, sweetheart, please, please! I don't like him! Hey, I know you from somewhere. ugly face, dumb face, donkey neck, weird legs! Oh, uh, uh, crazy arms, right? How are you? Eh. Well, we have to check something out. There's a rumor that you make your wieners Out of actual wiener dogs. I mean, it's obviously false, but No, it's true. What?! Hugo! Sorry, is that not The gourmet way to make wieners? Hmm. Why didn't I know about this? In my defense, the pet mortuary I get the dog meat from is very respected! Got to go. Bye, mort! You don't know me! Hugo, I've been eating a real wiener dog every day? Now I don't even know if I can finish this one. Nope, I can. I guess this is for you. Hugo, let me talk to him. Maybe I can smooth this over. Who likes milkshakes for free? No dog in it. It's chocolate, not chocolate lab. Ha, ha. I'm not into Puns. Oh, you got a little chocolate mustache. Oh. No, kind of looks Nice, actually. Ooh, I just got the weirdest feeling inside. Could be salmonella. That's what most weird feelings inside are. No, it's like, uh Something got on the wrong track A long time ago. It could also be diarrhea. Hmm. Come on, ron. Let's blow this hot dog stand. I get it. Children: Bye, mr. Health inspectors! I admire you both. Bye. Come on, ron! That's what would have happened. Tina, you got dark, girl. You got real dark. That was Disturbing. I need to go lie down. I kind of want a hot dog. So, that's it. There's no such thing as fate. Everything is randomness and chaos! Uh-huh. A meteorite could crash into our house any second! Any second. No one is meant for anyone! Not a soul! Tina, honey, it's okay, it's okay. Everything is random, But that's what makes life so wonderful. Sometimes all the crap in the universe lines up, Like that night I met your father. Or like the time I petted that dog and found a cheeto. Yeah. Everything lined up, and it came out belcher. How beautiful is that? I mean, look at gene. Okay, don't look at gene. It's because my pants are off, isn't it? I'm getting ready to exercise, And I don't want to sweat all over my Saturday shorts. Tina, what your mother is saying is, Maybe we weren't meant to be together, but we are together. No, that's not what I was saying. Well, I mean, I What I I meant that in a good way. Bob. Yeah. Wait. I get it. It was random fate that brought you together. Fate is real. It's just really random. No. It makes perfect sense. I feel so much better. Okay, then, that's what it is. Great talk, everybody. Ow! This seat hurts my private parts! Ah, who am I kidding? They're not that private. Wait. Oh, my god, that's it! What? What is? The bike! Testicular failure! I've been giving it to myself by riding the bike so much! It's been squeezing your tchotchkes, And you didn't notice that? I guess I didn't notice it over how much everything else hurt. But the results are fantastic. Look at you! I bet if I stop riding that thing, My mustache will grow back! Yeah, or you keep riding and get the butt-stache surgery. Both great options. Maybe put it to a vote? No. Maybe vote on whether to vote? Well, that's fair. All in favor of voting in favor for the butt-stache? All opposed to no butt-stache? Interesting. Oh, my god. I'm moving out. Hugo, did you ever feel we were Meant to be together? Not this again, ron!  it's called fate and it's great   that's an easy way to remember it   it's called fate and it's great   that's an easy way to remember it  No, no, no, no.  shave dad's face   ooh, ooh   belcher kids are erased   ooh, ooh, ooh   if dad's lip has no hair   ooh, ooh   we never come out of there   ooh, ooh, ooh   it's called fate and it's great   that's an easy way to remember it   call it fate-- fate   or destiny-- destiny   fate, fate, fate, fate   Fate is real. It's just really random.  No.  It makes perfect sense. I feel so much better. You've just watched bob's burgers. Now here are a few more shows to check out from fox. Yeah!

"Ugh! Another assembly about the Land Ship. We do this every year, and it's always the same thing. It makes me sick! I like the Land Ship. It's an important part of our town's history. And there's a parade. That's fun. I've been practicing my parade wave. -  Hi! - Hi! Look! Ghost Boy! - There's one in the boys' locker room, too. - I know. - What? - What? I just heard about it. Before we start, there has been a rash of graffiti at school and in our community. I want to say something to Ghost Boy, whoever you are. Graffiti is not cool. Not doing graffiti is cool. Cleaning graffiti is cool. - Right, Mr. Branca? - Very cool. All right, now that that's out of the way, please welcome the man who puts the ""actor"" in ""reenactor,"" Jim Skillman as Miss Patience Headbottom. Yay! Oh. My name is Patience Headbottom. I'm a 13-year-old girl. I lived during the War of 1812. And I'm here to tell you all the story of - The Land Ship. - The Land Ship! Correct. Even though I had cholera  I played a big part in the battle that made this ship famous. I didn't know cholera made you boring and old and a man. The British were going to attack. Our town had only one small ship protecting us. My idea was to move the frigate onto land. The night of the British attack was humid and filled with great tension. - Just like my farts. - Shh, Gene. The townspeople dragged the ship up onto shore, close to what in your world is now the Fashion City Outlet Mall.  Fashion City Outlet Mall.  Hey, guys, come on. We lit the lights on the ship, hoisted the sail and rocked the ship back and forth to make it seem like it was on the water. When the British sailed in to attack, they misjudged the coastline and ran aground before they could fire a shot. A peaceful end to a dangerous situation. And then we swarmed their ships and slaughtered them like sheep. - Oh. Right. - I hope you all come as we rock the boat at the Land Ship parade this weekend. And now, the sea shanty commemorating the sloop that duped the British.  I'll sing you a song  Let's just leave while it's still dark in here. - Good idea. Let's jam, Tam. - Hey, wait for me. I don't think we're allowed to leave until it's over. Ugh, Tina, you're such a goody two boobs. - No, I'm not. - Oh, yes, you are. - You're like an unsalted pretzel. - What do you mean? I mean that you're bland, and I mean that you're boring. You're like if school and news had a baby. It's kind of true, Tina. Get some spice into you, girl! I can be spicy. Look my shoe's untied, and I'm not even gonna retie it. Actually, I am. I could trip. Oh, they're gone. I'm so excited for the Land Ship parade! I know. I'm so glad that gas line blew on Front Street, and they rerouted it this way. Sorry, Front Street. You blew it! Think of all the business we're gonna get! Sweet Land Ship business. Uh what's happening? Oh, no. No, no, no! No, no! Stop! Don't put those there! This is where they told me to put 'em. Please. This is my restaurant right here. You you can't put Porta Pottis in front of a restaurant. - They stink! - Not yet. They're gonna. There's an empty storefront right next door. You can move them there. - You can move your restaurant. - No, I can't. - Yeah. You could rent that space. - That's absurd! Hey, Bob, I see you're getting ready for the parade. Ha, ha! Fart noise! Shut up, Jimmy! There, there, right back at you. You guys have a lot of fun, huh? Where's a good place to eat? Is that place across the street any good? - Looks good. - No! Hey, guys, lunch break in ten! We're goin' over to that pizza place across the street! Don't go there! I just told you it isn't good. Eat here! Nah. We're not gonna eat at a restaurant with Porta Pottis in front of it. It's disgusting. Quittin' time! Can't wait to get this monkey suit off. - Hey, do you guys think I'm an unsalted pretzel? - I could eat. No, am I, like, bland and a safe snacking choice? I was just wondering if that's what people think of me. Oh, I don't think people think of you. Well, I want people to think I'm spicy and fun and dangerous. Like a bullet made of chorizo? - Kind of. - Where are you going? Oh, I have to renew a library book. It's not due today, but I don't want to cut it too close. Spicy! Hi, Mr. Ambrose. I need to renew this book. Renewed. Oh, my God, this book isn't due for three days. What's wrong with you?! - I'm being responsible. - Ugh. Mr. Ambrose, can I see that book for a second? Look at as many books as you want. It's a library. Ghost Boy. Who returned this book? - It's on the card. - There's only one name Jordan Cagan. Then that's who checked it out. Go away! Jordan Cagan is Ghost Boy? Okay, I'm gonna start piling these books up so I can't see you. - Okay. - Now just glasses. Now just bangs. Now you're gone. Jordan Cagan can't be Ghost Boy. He wears sweaters. It can't be him. He's drinking whole milk. Yeah, it can't be him. - Oh, my God, it's him! - Tina Belcher? - Ghost Boy? - Oh, great. I guess that's it. Are you gonna turn me in? You're like an unsalted pretzel. You're like if school and news had a baby. Get some spice into you, girl! Ugh! No, Jordan, I'm not gonna turn you in. I'm gonna turn myself in to something else. _ Aah! I mean, come in. - Night, Tina. - Good night. I'm going to sleep right now. I'm pretty much already falling asleep. Dozing off. Mm. Okay. ""See you soon baboon."" Wait, spice it up. ""See you soon, bitch."" Too spicy, too spicy. Oh, God, I sent it. Okay, it's fine. So you do the little Ghost Boys with your marker during the day, and the bigger Ghost Boys at night with spray paint? And you could get caught, but you don't care because the rush is so good? And Ghost Boy's supposed to be you? No, it's it's just something I draw. Oh, I thought maybe because you feel invisible like a ghost - since you don't have any friends. - What? Also, the ghost is shaped like a ""J."" Oh, my God. I'm shaped like a ""J."" No, you're not. The - It's the first letter of your name. - Oh, right. - You're really smart, huh? - Very. So do we blow on it now to dry it, or does it just dry on its own, or ? Oh, no. We have to run away now. Good idea. They'll never suspect us if we're running. The good Porta Potti is out of toilet paper, but full of memories. Gene, I told you not to use those. They're for the Land Ship parade, and we hate them. Aw! My tired Tina. You sleepy, honey? Yeah, I'm tired. But I've never felt more alive. Oh! Puberty! Gross. Uh-oh. I think I left my backpack in the Porta Potti. - I'll go get it. - Someone just went in there. Maybe they'll finish my math homework for me. Maybe they'll start it, too. Ghost Boy strikes again! I want to rip this up and sell it. No wait! Gift it to a museum. Take the write-off. Yeah! Gift it, Zeke! Wow! Look at that. Ah, da, da, da, da! This is not to be admired! You saying that makes me admire it more. Oh, uh, then look at that great graffiti! - I love it! - No! Just everyone go inside! No, ma'am. Ma'am, I know about the Land Ship parade. I just want to move them Oh, you're a man? What what was I saying? I think this is going well. He's got a way with people. So, hey  man, if we don't move the Porta Pottis, I'm gonna lose all my business. - I need them moved! - You tell 'em, Bobby! Hey, Bob, how's the view? - Ugh. Jerk. - No, not you! You're great. No, no don't transfer me. Please don't transfer me! - You on hold, Bob? - Yes, Teddy. - What are they playing? - It's Tom Petty. Tom Petty! Back down? Don't back down? No, it's not ""Don't Back Down."" Take you to the gates of Hell? Right? - ""American Girl."" - ""American Girl."" Do you have a speakerphone? - No, Teddy. - Do you have another extension down here? The song ended. It's the B-52's now. - ""Rock Lobster""? - ""Love Shack."" They're playing all the hits! So, you want to go out tagging again tonight? Yes. We're a tag team. Get it? - That's a good one. - Thanks. Hi, Jordan, who we've never eaten lunch with before ever. What's up? - Nothing. - Um Jordan's a friend. Jordan, you are a delight. Now you're my friend, and friends share fries. So, Jor-jo. That's what I call you now. You guys got super lunchy super fast. What's your secret, Jay-jams? - You gave me two nicknames. - Yup. - Which one do you like better? - I guess ""Jay-jams."" - Jor-jo. - Jor-jo? I'm gonna call you ""Damn Jam."" - Um, I got to get going. - He seems great. Tina, when did you start hanging out with Jordan? I got to get going. It's just you and me now. - Yup. - Oh. I was talking to the taco. Land Ship parade tomorrow! - Here it comes. - Mm. Hey, the city could change their mind, right? Get a last-minute call from the governor? - Make a little Porta Potti pardon? - Mm. Aah! Oh, my God, Tina! What happened? I fell asleep. I'll have what she's having. Tina, what's wrong? Are you sick? Yeah, why are you so tired all the time? That's like the fourth bowl of something you've fallen asleep in. Oh, I've just been having trouble sleeping lately, 'cause of I'm so excited about the Land Ship. Tina's got the Land Ship fever. Or she has a real fever. Can you just hold your hand there for a second, Dad? I'm just gonna take a quick TTina, I can't I got to I can't hold Tina, I can't hold my hand here. You're spoiling her, Dad! You're right. I should just let go. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I can't do it. Huh? - Nothing. Go back to sleep. - Okay. Nice one. Thanks. I've been having so much fun with you, Tina. Me, too. I mean, me with you, not me with me. I've never spent this much time with a girl. And I've never spent this much time with my spicy side. Whoa! Jordan, did you mean to do that? I sure did. That was my first kiss. I couldn't tell at all. It had a lot of the same things that real kissing has in it. You inspire me, Tina. - You make me feel like I can do anything. - You can! - You make me want to punch the air. - Punch it! You make me feel like I can jump over this parking meter. That looks a little high. Um I want to maybe try that again another time? - Okay. Yeah. - Hey, listen, tonight we're gonna tag something really special. - A greeting card? - No, even better. The sail of the Land Ship. - Wait, what? - Picture it a giant Ghost Boy 20 feet tall. They unfurl the sail during the parade Ghost Boy! The crowd is stunned. And we know it was us who did it. It's just seems like that's really big and the Land Ship is important to history and people'll be upset and we could go to jail and Oh, you're kissing me again. You're so wild, Tina. Yeah, I am. Right? So, are you in or are you in? - I'm in. - Should we kiss more? Yes, but let's work on a couple things. You don't have to cover my nose and my mouth with your mouth. You're still doing it. Ookay, just You So tired. Got to look up sails. Am I really going to tag the sail of the Land Ship with Jordan? He is a bad kisser. But he's a bad boy, and I guess bad boys are bad kissers. Oh no. I just typed all that into the search bar! Delete. - Delete. - So, everything is normal with you and you're not acting weird at all. Oh, good, I'm glad you think so. Except for what are you looking at right now? Aha. Sails. Wait. Sails? Yeah. I've just always wondered what sailing was like, so now I know. And how do you explain this? I found it in your room. A bandana. Flair for your microphone stand? You're joining Aerosmith! Guys. I just need to do my sail reading. Please. Jordan. Sails. Tired. Bandana. All in one week. I'm gonna figure this out, Tina. You and Jordan are making tiny boats with bandana sails for tiny, nocturnal animals. Oh! That's not it! But I'm gonna get it. Bobby's back. What'd the guy from the city say? Are they moving the stank tanks? - No, Teddy, they're not. - Aw. In fact, when I explained there were four Porta Pottis in front of my restaurant, they said there should be five. They're adding another. You know what? If they won't move them, I will. I'm gonna move 'em. - Yeah. - Tonight. - Get 'em! - Just like they moved the Land Ship. Under the cover of darkness. Let's do it. We'll rock 'em back and forth - and then slaughter everyone inside. - Yeah. Tina, this is so intense. We're like Bonnie and Clyde. Didn't they get shot at the end of the movie? Maybe say ""spoiler"" before you give away the end of a movie, okay? Aah! - What was that? - It was a pigeon. It wasn't a tiny flying security guard? No. Okay, let's hoist the sail. Okay. According to my notes, first we have to announce we're raising it. For safety reasons. Raising the mainsail. Okay. Thank you for letting me know. What's next? Then we pull on the halyard. And I think that's this. Um, okay, well, that seems like a good start. Maybe we should, uh, go home and come back tomorrow, um, good night's sleep, and finish. Little help? Oh, right. It's the perfect canvas. It's literally canvas. Almost too perfect to paint on, right? Where are you going? Up the ladder? Okay, great, here I come. I'm totally on board with this. You say something? No. I swear I keep hearing something. I don't hear anything. Whoa. We really did it. Yeah. So should we furl up the sail? - What? - Furl up the sail. Oh, I thought you said go back in time and not do this, but yeah, sure, let's get furlin'. Which shoes are better for moving Porta Pottis, Bob flats or pumps? Flats, I guess. But why are you in a dress? It's the only black thing I own. You said to put on dark colors so we blend in with the night. Okay, well, just hurry up. Teddy's gonna be here in a little bit. I just got to do my eye makeup and curl my hair. Lin, you don't need makeup. But I want to do a smoky eye. I never get to dress up. See you tomorrow for the big reveal. Yeah. See ya. Wait. Aren't you forgetting something? Oh, yeah. Bye. Mm Oh, God. Wash it off, wash it off! What have you done? Exactly. Aah! We looked in the Porta Potti and found a porta naughty. You've been sneaking out at night to meet Jordan, haven't you? - Wait, are you crying? - I've been sneaking out because Jordan is Ghost Boy and I've been helping him and then we did something like kissing and then I ruined Bonnie and Clyde for him by saying they die and then we painted a giant Ghost Boy on the sail of the Land Ship and now the parade is gonna be ruined. Because of me. Wait, wait, wait. What? Bonnie and Clyde die? Jordan is Ghost Boy and you're helping him? - Yes. - Wow. I was way off. I thought it was the bland leading the bland. I graffitied the Land Ship. What do I do? I wear white underwear. And, honey, what you need is some bleach. Wait, I got it. I can paint over it. I just need a bunch of white paint now, in the middle of the night, when paint stores aren't usually open. Wait a minute. You say ""paint"" and I say t'ain't no problem with that, because I know there's some in the basement. Ta-da! Paint. And spackle. How did you know about this, Gene? Let's just say I thought this tarp was a tent and I thought that spackle was marshmallow fluff. And I was right, in a way. I'm going back to the Land Ship. We're coming with you. Yeah. Let's go unpaint the town. Where's Teddy? We need his truck to move the Porta Pottis. This is so exciting. You know who would love this? The kids. Oh, yeah, you're right. - Should we wake 'em? - No. Let 'em sleep. Plus we all might get arrested. Let's push these Pottis. - Tina, wow. - I know. This isn't gonna work. We don't have enough time. Great, let's get started. We're gonna get caught here. We're gonna get in trouble. I don't hear paint brushes. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, boy. - More gas, Teddy. - More gas. - So, faster? - Uh, uh, uh, easy. - Yes, faster. - Faster. Punch it. - Easy, easy. - Okay, punch it. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. - Teddy, don't listen to Linda, just go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy No, no, no, no. - What am I doing? - They're gonna push into each other and just slide right up the street. Bo They're tipping. Oh, God, she's right. Teddy, stop. - Pull forward? - Yeah, but not too quickly. - Quickly? - Oh, they sloshed. Aw, that's not a good smell. Uh I was never here. Love your dress, Linda. See you tomorrow. Oh, my God. They won, Bobby. The Porta Pottis won. Come to bed. Well, this is what's known in the sailing world as ""good enough"". Oh, no. We missed a spot. Tina, we got to go. People in costumes are gonna be here soon. I'm going back up to get it. No. There's not enough time. I'm no scientist, but that looks like the sun coming up. I got to finish undoing what I did. Can't quite reach. Someone's here. Tina, hurry up. Almost got it. Aah! The British are coming! Last little spot. Gene, what's happening with the reenactors? They're eating breakfast burritos and doing gentle stretching. Now they're fifing! Oh, my God, they're fifing toward us! Got it. Done. Kids. Come on. It's time for the Land Ship. Can I have a cup of coffee? Or a hard slap in the face? No. And why are you all yawning so much? Why are you yawning? Because you were yawning, so I I just yawned. So you're a copycat. Come on, let's go. If we miss the reenactment we're gonna have to reenact the reenactment. Yup. Let's go watch the ship set jail. I I mean ""fail."" I mean ""terrible secret."" I mean ""sail."" Aw, puberty. Patience! Patience Headbottom, hi! I, uh, know her. Here comes the Land Ship. I'm gonna rock you like that boat. Come on! - Aah, stop! Don't rock me, Zeke. - Come on! - Too hard! - Jordan. Oh, hey. - Uh, maybe you should go. - What? I wouldn't want to be anywhere else but right here with you right now. Uh All hands hoay. Rock it, boys. Raising the mainsail. This is it. Come here. I want to, um kiss your eyes with my hands. Stop, silly. Wait. - What the hell?! - Uh, yeah. What the hell? What happened to our giant Ghost Boy? I know. So much. What you said. We were up all night. We made so many stencils. Well, we might as well enjoy the parade. Wait. Tina, did you do this? What? Yes, I did. Excuse you? We did. Yeah. We saw the sunrise. It was beautiful. I cried. Why, Tina, why? At first I liked doing graffiti with you, but then we went too far. This just isn't me. It's not. Trust me, Jordan, it's not. I know her. Hold on. Jordan, you're Ghost Boy? And Tina, you're a tag hag? What?! Yes. Yes, I'm Ghost Boy, okay? And Tina's my girlfriend, or I thought she was. She went out with me for the last five nights and we tagged the whole city. And we kissed. She was my first kiss. And my last. You painted over my heart, Tina. Jordan, someday you're gonna meet a great girl who doesn't care about good kissing or the law or anything. I just know it. Whatever. - Hey, you're Ghost Boy? - Yeah. Do you want to, like, um, hang out? Yeah. Oh, that was faster than I thought. Tina, you saved the Land Ship parade. Well, technically I ruined it. But then I saved it. Girl, you got a dangerous streak and a not-dangerous streak. I like it. Tina, I have so much more respect for you now. Thanks, Tammy. I still have the same amount of respect for you. Which is not much, but, um, forget it. - Wait, Tina, you went out with Jordan? - Yeah. And you guys kissed? Well, it was sort of like kissing, but it was hard to breathe, um Okay, I don't need the details. You want to watch the rest of the parade together? Oh, I I thought we were watching it together. Yeah, but now we officially are. Okay. Ha. Look at the line in front of the Porta Pottis there, Bob. Never seen a line in front of your place before. - 'Cause you never have a line. - Yeah. All right, Trev. Oh, Jimmy will you p Wait a second. Two more burgers of the day, Bob. Coming right up. Oh, my God. This is turning into a great day. We're gonna make a killing. Jimmy, these Porta Pottis are the best thing that's ever happened to us! You know what these Porta Pottis smell like? Success!  Oh, my God.  I'll sing you a song, a song I'll sing   Hi houy, singin' a song   Hi houy, singin' a song   A humid night in the early spring   Hi houy, singin' a song   Hi houy, singin' a song   The British were comin', muckenders were they   Hi houy, Hi houy   Rock it, boys   With only one ship, our ribs they did prey   Hi houy, singin' this song   We bellowed and blundered and twiddled our wobbles   Hi houy, singin'"
"You're watching Bob's Burgers. You're going lip bald! Catch all-new episodes Sundays and check out our other Fox programs-- The Simpsons, Family Guy and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Help me with that pigeon head. I can't see anything. Only on Fox. Only on Fox. Hi, everyone. Hey, Teddy. Hi, Teddy. Hi, little witch. Aah! It has a motion sensor. It's okay, Teddy. Calm down. Look at her go. She's all that and a pointy hat. Is it me, or is she just doing the same thing over and over again? How's it work? It's electronic. Just move your hand in front of it. Aah! I just explained it. Turn it off! She won't stop making eye contact with me! Aw, come on, Teddy. Tomorrow's Halloween. We're trying to get into the holiday spirit. Boo! Yeah, we're even taking the kids to a haunted house this afternoon. It's an annual tradition. Like when Dad replaces all the sponges. Sponge Day! They last longer than you think. Ugh! Again with the haunted houses? I think I'll pass this year. What's the matter, Louise? You don't like being scared? Are you kidding? I would love to be scared. The problem is I see every scare coming a mile away. Don't you? Why doesn't everyone? Haunted houses are so dumb. Oh, a coffin. Real original. I wonder if something's gonna pop out of there. Aah! Aah! Oh. Aah! Okay, maybe wear less cologne next time. Smell kind of gave you away. He smells terrifying. Sir you're making chainsaw noises with your mouth. Sorry. Yeah. It's not fair. Tina and Gene can be scared by anything. Watch. Aah! Aah! Clapping! And look at Teddy. He gets scared by a toy witch. Aah! Get out of here! Be nice to her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. There. There's your little hat. See? I want that. I mean, not that exactly but something like that. That rush! That's a shame, Louise. Hey, could I trouble you for another side of pickles! Aah! Nice try, Mort. It's just not gonna work. I can't be scared. It's a curse. Could I still get those pickles? No. Oh. I'm upset. Louise, what if I told you this is the year you finally get scared? Because this haunted house is special. How is it special? Is there a VIP list? Will there be any Hollywood bigwigs there? Is anyone from Murphy Brown coming? It's special because your father and I planned it! Wait, what? You two made a haunted house? Yep. It's in a secret location. We've been working on it all week. You might want to wear pants you don't care about 'cause you're gonna be peein' in 'em! Scare me enough and I'll pee in your pants. Deal. Mom's bringing the scary and Dad's bringing the hairy. Did you guys know about this? No. No. Okay. Where is it? You'll see. We should probably have a safeword. I vote for, ""Mom and Dad, stop it."" All right! If you got it, haunt it.  When I see you I fall apart   Like a zombie, I got too nervous  Dad, this is the new Boyz 4 Now song. That's great, Tina. It just dropped today. Don't say ""dropped."" - Dropped. - Okay, okay. I've never been in this neighborhood before. Looks like a lot of old people live here. See, it's already getting good. Old people are scary. Being an old person is scary. Right, Mom and Dad? Mm. Hey! It is. Here we are. I mean: here we are. Now give your mom and me exactly four minutes to go inside and finish setting up. And then enter if you dare. Wait! I don't get it! Did you guys buy a house just to haunt? It's complicated! We'll explain later! What's the plan? You gonna flip this mamma jamma? Gonna need a paint job! All right, let's see what the old kooks have cooked up. I hope it's not Dad in sandals. Yeah, his toes are a nightmare. Welcome! Nice to creep you. Allow me to intro-boo myself. I am the ghostess with the mostess! Hi, Mom. I am not your mother. I am Lady Bobbenstein, made in a lab from parts of beautiful dead women. And they didn't have any other ankles? Just asking. Gene! No, they're good. They're good. They're fine. Ooh lightning! Aah! That could cause a seizure! Now, won't you join me for a tour of our spooky home laboratory? Oh, yeah, there's nothing scarier than a tour. Let's do this! Yeah. Follow me to the mad scientist who stitched me together, Dr. Bobbenstein! Hello. Here in my lab, I store human body parts to make my monsters. Aah! That wig is scary and so are the countertops! I know! I can't look at them! And what's up with that backsplash? Uh-oh! There's rats tickling your toes! Aah! Aah! And now please stick your hand into this doctor box to feel human eyes! Uh Huh. Excuse me, Doctor, I think you might need a refill on eyeballs. Wh-What do you mean? There's nothing in here. Do you guys need some time to work this out? Uh, hold on, hold on. Just give us a second. Okay. Lin, did you forget to put the grapes in the box? You were supposed to get the grapes. I got the spaghetti. Okay, fine, just skip it. Skip it. Lady Bobben-steen Bobbenstein. Stein. It appears your stitches are coming undone. Oh, no! My intestines! Aah! Yuck! Mom, angel hair? What? It's all we had. It's just that's the least scary pasta. It's in the name. And now, while I stitch Lady Bobbenstein back up, get ready for the next part of our haunted tour. I smell a costume change! You guys, I think I know what this haunted house needs. Grapes? Should I call my guy? No, Gene. It needs scares. Someone in this house should get spooked. I was spooked. A little. Were you? Maybe not. I was either scared or chilly. I was confused and anxious. I say we show Mom and Dad how it's done. You mean scare Mom and Dad in their own haunted house? That's right. Let's turn our parents into ""scare-ents."" Yeah! And then back into parents in time for bath and bed. How are we gonna scare Mom and Dad? Dad's scared of failure. Where do we find some of that? Let's look in the cupboards. No, no, no. Just follow my lead. And now for your next haunt, walk down the hallway, but whatever you do, don't open the closet door! Wow! This might be the scariest haunted house I've ever been to! Okay, here we come! Right, guys? Yeah, we're coming down the hall! Frightened and afraid! Aah! Two-headed monster! Aah! Where are the kids? I don't know. It sounded like they were right here. Kids? Gene? Louise? Tina? Look, Bob, the back door is open. Kids? Kids! We don't even know this area. They could be anywhere! Don't panic. Let's look around. We'll find them. Kids?! Oh, God, Bob, look! It's Tina's glasses in a pile of leaves! Tina! Not like that! - Rawr! - Aah! Gotcha. And that's how you scare somebody. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. They got us. Gene, why are you in your underpants? Don't change the subject, Father! We just scared your pants off, not mine! Also, I was warm! Yeah. You tricks just got treated. I mean, kind of. You basically just jumped out of a pile of leaves. Yep. And we put, like, a lot of effort into our thing. Sad how ours worked better than yours, huh? Yeah. It really is. Well, should we go? Can we go to the other house that's ours, that's fine? No, we're not finished with our haunted house. We haven't even gotten to the exorcism. I think we're good, Mom. I was gonna spin my head around in a circle and barf on your father. Like the good ol' days. Ha! Lin. Lin, stop. It's over. Bleh. We're-we're just not that good at this. Hmm. B-plus. Maybe B-minus. Hey, why give it a grade? Bob, don't give up. We squeezed ourselves into this T-shirt. We can't go home now. Or we could. You can spin your head around at home while we watch TV. All right, fine, you sour candies, we'll go home. Gene, you're gonna put your clothes back on, right? Oh, am I? I You're the one making it weird, Dad. Oh, crap. We have a flat tire. What? Here, I'll blow it up. Give it to me, give it to me. What about the spare? That was the spare. All four of these are spares. Are you talking about us? I guess I'll call for a tow. Oh, great. I'm not getting any reception here. That old man is staring at us. That's weird. Hello? Can we help you? Take a picture! It'll last longer! Wait, don't take it yet! Catch me just as I'm looking over my shoulder. Now! Oh, come on, how can I not have any bars? Why's he staring at us? Maybe we just have that certain something that makes you want to stare at us and not say anything while holding gardening shears. Hi! Hello, sir! Cell reception, huh? Not so great around here? Okay, he's not saying anything. Um why don't we go back inside and see if the landline works? Bye, creepy man! Keep it creepy! Lock it, Bob. Yeah. Good idea. Oh, thank God. It works. Wow, this phonebook is, like, from the '90s. Let's see if Tony Toni Tow-me is still in business. Hey, Mom, question, why does this house have mothball smell? Follow-up question, whose house is this? David Lee Mothball? Maybe the owner of a mothball team? It's an empty house that Mort said we could use. It belonged to one of his clients. Uh what was that? Gene, did that come out of you? My butt doesn't have the technology! Yet. Huh. It was probably just the pipes. Oh, hi, uh, I, uh I need a tow truck. I have a flat tire. Or I'll need a tire. Or-or air, I guess, for the tire. But you're the professional. Wait, Mom, did you say this house is one of Mort's clients'? Yeah, why? Mort's a mortician, so aren't his clients all dead people? All right, pipes. We heard you the first time. Stop being so desperate for attention. Everybody, keep it down, please. Uh the address is Oh, shoot, I don't know the address. Uh, hold on-- Lin, go outside and look at the house number. No. Oldie Scissorhands is out there. Oh, wait, I wrote it down. It's, uh, is that ""Poplar"" or ""Popular""? No, streets aren't called Popular. Aah! Whoa. Oh, my God, Bob. There's something in the basement! No, no, no. The phone line is dead. And it's dark! It's literally a triple threat! What could possibly make a sound like that? It's probably just a raccoon or a possum running around in the basement. So did this raccoon and/or possum shake the whole house and turn off all the lights, Father?! Gene, it probably just chewed through a wire and then that short circuited the fuse breaker thing. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, go on. You clearly know what you're talking about. Uh I don't like the sound of that sound. We should get out of this house, Bob. No, no, Lin, the tow truck is coming. We have to wait for it. Look, why don't I just go downstairs and see what's making the noise? I'm sure there is nothing to be afraid of. Then we can relax until the tow truck gets here. Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark! Uh Leave the light, Bob. Are you crazy? Well, I can't see what's in the basement if I don't have the light, Lin. All right, fine. We're coming with you. Just a fun family trip to the basement to get killed. Gene, we're not gonna get killed. Maimed. Stabbed. Lin. Linda. Beaten. Burned. Lin. Stop. What? See? It's just a normal, dark, very, very dark basement. Lin, you're digging your fingernails into my arm. Oh, sorry. Can I dig my fingernails into your other arm, Dad? Sure, Tina. Yes. I call love handles. That's my word for the butt. I'm already holding it. Just 'cause I don't want to fall down the stairs. Dad's butt is very sturdy. Thank you, Louise. It is. Oh look, they have a puddle in their basement, too. It's ghost pee. Gene, it's not ghost pee. Look, see, everything seems fine. Nothing weird. There's a washing machine. A furnace. Some old boxes of junk. And a ghost! Aah! What is that? Okay, it's not a ghost. It's not a ghost. It's just a uh a cloak. It's a cloak. It's a cloak. See? Nothing to worry about. Yeah, there's nothing scary about a dark cloak hanging from a meat hook in a dead person's basement! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Plenty of people have cloaks, right? Monks, and w-wizards and Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, sure. Liberace. Yup. Uh, Ann Wilson from Heart. Definitely. Maybe it's just a really dark, scary night shirt. Run! Oh, my God. All right, we're getting out of this house. Good idea. Everybody, follow me. Okay. Oh, God. There's something right outside, Bobby. Uh everyone upstairs, now. We got to hide somewhere. How about behind Dad? I'm not big enough. Keep telling yourself that, pal. You guys. Look. That isn't a good use of that room. Yeah, let's maybe rule that room out. Uh, uh, um, yeah, the bathroom. Let's go in the bathroom. Yeah, let's go to the bathroom. Okay. Let's talk about what we just saw. I, for one, did not care for it. That doll makes me miss the cloak in the basement. Louise, I wish I was un-scare-able like you. Yeah, it's just dumb cult stuff. Nothing to be scared of. I mean, what is it with the sticks these days, right? What if it's the ghost of the person who used to live here and they hate mustaches? Then two of you are in trouble. It's not a ghost, Lin. There's no such thing as ghosts. Fine, then, Bob. What do you think it is? It's probably just a murderer. What? No, it's not a murderer, Tina. It's probably just the wind. Inside wind. It-it happens a lot in these old houses. I know about inside wind. I know about it right now. Sorry, everybody. Ugh, Gene. Come on. It's something bad. It's gonna kill us in this bathroom and it's gonna it's gonna be easy to clean up 'cause of the tile floor. Linda, you're not helping. Also, will you take off that bald cap? It's freaking everyone out. I didn't even know I still had it on. It's comfortable. Wait, listen. Oh, my God. The wind is coming up the stairs. Okay, nobody move. Nobody say a word. Dad. Yes. I feel like you're doing a really good job as a dad. Thank you, Gene. I'm having a good childhood. Okay, great. Not right now, but overall. I got it. Thanks. No, thank you. Uh, okay Thank you for your service. Just, um, try and be quiet. Whatever it is, it's right outside. You guys, if we go out this window, we can get on the roof. Um yeah. Go, go, go. Now what? We're on a freakin' roof. The only way down is down. Oh, my God. I hope the tow truck is coming. Please let the tow truck be coming. And I hope they bring a ladder. And the police. Mom and Dad, you would tell us if we knew how to fly, right? Uh, you guys That seems weird and bad. Maybe that's Tony, Toni, and Tow-me? Holy crap! Oh, my God! We're surrounded by a ring of fire! Who has a ring of water? Aah! Is this what Burning Man is? Because I don't like it! What do we do? What do we do? We got scary cloak people down there and something creepy chasing us in there. And I'm scared of heights and cloak people and being killed. Ah! I have reception. I'm calling for help. My emergency contact is Jimmy Jr. If you can't reach him, you can also try 911. Oh, crap! Aah! That's fine. No big deal. We don't need that. Oh, my God, they're gonna sacrifice us. I hate this neighborhood. Okay, everybody just stay calm, all right? We're up here. They're down there. There's no way they can get to us. Yeah. They're not even a great cult, anyway. Just a circle of fire, you know, some cloaks, and a creepy doll with twigs for eyes, right? What's so scary about that? That's not scary. That's not scary! Louise Louise, sweetie, sweetie, baby. What is happening? Gotcha. Wha? We got you. Huh? We gotcha. You wanted to be scared, Louise. Well, I think we scared you. Wait a You, uh What We planned the whole thing. What? : What? Aw, you should see the look on your face. You see? It's you, scared. So they're in on it, too? Hi, Louise. Happy Halloween. It's Teddy from your dad's restaurant. Teddy? Hi, Louise. Mort? Aah! Hey, hey, easy. That's my mother. Say hi, Mom. No, Mom. We're done. It's over. We did it. And this nice man with the hedge clippers is Mort's mom's new boyfriend, Arthur. Hi, how you doing. I call him Arth Vader. 'Cause of the way he breathes. He has allergies. Gene? Tina? You two were in on this too? Yeah, we were acting. I practiced all my lines last night. Like this: ""Aah."" I wanted to do the whole thing with a Cockney accent, but Mom nixed it. I-I don't understand. How did you do all this? And how did I fall for it? It was a lot of work. So many e-mails. This is Mort's mom's house. And it's perfect 'cause it's old and creepy. And nicely decorated. Very homey. First we had to do the decoy haunted house. Yeah, why did you do a decoy haunted house? That was Tina's idea. It was genius. She said we had to do the world's worst haunted house so that you wouldn't suspect us. Oh, I was talking about something else when I said that. Wait. Really? Hey, a good idea's a good idea. Besides, it wasn't the world's worst haunted house. The bald caps were good. The spaghetti Unbelievable. You guys set me up. And we almost got away with it. Oh, wait! We did! Yup. While you were going through the decoy haunted house, Teddy took the air out of our tire. Yeah. And I also cut the brake line. I thought that would be scary, too. Teddy, are you serious? Hey, let's not worry about that, Bobby. Finish your story.  Mort hid in the basement and made scary sounds. Mort, how did you make that crazy croaking sound? That actually came out of me. I threw my back out when I was making that big boom sound. I'm in a lot of pain.  The ring of fire was Mort's idea. Is it gonna hurt my grass? No, Mom. No, no. It'll be fine. It's non-burning fire. And Arthur was really nice to offer to help. He's only known Mort's mom for three weeks. But it sounds like it's going really well. We're just having fun and seeing where it goes. No pressure, no labels. I get it. So, yeah, that's how it all came together. We love you, baby. Hope you liked it. Liked it? It was freakin' incredible! I'm still shaking. Look. Look at this. I can't stop. Oh, it's great. I got scared. I got scared! Oh, you're the best family in the whole world. Aw, my little scream queen. Happy Halloween, Louise. Bring it in, everybody. Bring it in. I love my family Lin so much. Lin, careful. We're on a roof. Storm moving in, everyone. Stop it, Mort. I startle easily. Ah, Mort, you little Hey, girl. Yo, girl. Halloween has gotten so commercialized. So many commercials. Let's try to get back to what it's really about. What's it about, Boo Boo? Love. Oh, that's right. Yeah.  When I see you, I fall apart   Like a zombie   I got too nervous to ask you out   To the prom-bie   I wish I could make you mine   When I open my mouth   I sound like Frankenstein  Who's the girl? How'd she get in the video? She's not a Boy 4 Now. She won an essay contest. It had to be under I couldn't cut mine down. Yeah, that's rough. That's Allen does not make a believable mummy. There's that idiot Boo Boo. It was his dumb birthday last week. Not that I care or even know that.

No. Yes What? Yes, it is. No, it isn't. They switch Allens sometimes, Bobby. No, they don't. Don't tell Teddy. That's his favorite one. He's a big Allen guy.  It's Halloween   I'm scared of the dark   Going door to door   To your mama's house   I can feed her   Got to get that candy  Okay, this took a turn. It's like a reverse Thriller. Nice.  Trick or treat  Captioned by  Girl, it's freaky  - Sing it. - Uh  You trick or treat me  - Dad, sing. - Come on, Dad, sing it.  My teeth are extra sharp   My body's extra hairy   I'm running in the dark   I love you so much it's scary   Girl, it's freaky   You trick or treat me   My teeth are extra sharp   My body's extra hairy   I'm running in the dark"
"Look at you. You don't even know how beautiful you are. That's what makes you so beautiful. Well, I heard that turkey's had a ton of work done. Had his head chopped off, skin removed, big ol' boobs  It's Thanksgiving   Thanksgiving for everybody   'Cept for Europeans.  Don't worry about the Europeans. They're fine. They've got tapas. And Belgium. And Leonardo DiCaprio, eight months out of the year. Okay, turkey's in. Now time to make everything else. Potatoes, hello, good to see you. Carrots, you're gonna be pretty good. I mean, you're not potatoes, but you're fine. Would you say Dad and Thanksgiving sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G? I would kiss Thanksgiving, Louise. Its kiss would be salty and delicious. Like a mermaid. Okay, I better go get Gayle before I forget to get Gayle. Mwah. Why can't she drive herself? Come on, Bob. She sprained her ankle. She says she can't drive. She also said she can't use toothpaste because she's afraid she'll get addicted. Bob. Fine. But I should get her, Lin. It's really snowy out. So? Uh, remember the last time you drove our car in the snow? Oh, no! Oh. Oh, right. How'd she sprain her ankle? She said she slipped on salsa while she was salsa dancing. Poor Gayle. And to make it worse, she's down in the dumps 'cause Mr. Frond dumped her. I know just the guy to set her up with. Oh, wait, I was thinking of Mr. Frond. Never mind. All right. So who wants to come with me? What?! It's snowing! Yeah. You're a kid. Kids love snow. Take it easy, Norman Rockwell. I'm more into rain now. Fine. I'll go by myself, but just no one touch anything while I'm gone. Stay away from the oven. Calm down. No one wants to cook, you weirdo. If anything happens, don't call AAA, because we don't have them and we owe them money from when we did! I hope you're over the river and through the woods to Grandmother's house already, because we're looking at a nasty Thanksgiving blizzard, folks. Stay off the roads. You stay off the roads. Come on, Gayle. Gayle? It's me, Bob. Your five locks were unlocked, so I'm-I'm coming in. I'm not a murderer. And if there's a murderer in here, uh, don't murder me. Bob? Is that you? Yep. Uh, car's out front and it's really coming down, so we-we need I'm in the bathroom. I need help. Oh. Uh, great. I'll just come into the bathroom where you are to help with whatever you need. I fell when I was getting out of the shower, and I can't stand back up. Oh, okay. Let me just Um, give me your hand. Come on, Gayle! Oh, calm down, Bob. It's just my breasts. And if something happens between us, it happens. Gayle, nothing is gonna happen. Well, not with that attitude it won't. Hand me the shirt, Bob. Okay, is it on yet? No. Okay. Now? No, not yet. Gayle, why is it taking you so long to put a shirt on? Your arms aren't sprained. Okay, it's on. No. No, wait. Okay, now. Mm. No. Hold on. Please put it on. Gail. Great. You look great. So let's go. I just need to find my cats. I can't leave 'em here alone. What? No, no, no. We're not taking them to my house. I-I'm allergic. But Mr. Business is hypoglycemic! He has to eat something every two hours or he gets real lethargic. Fine, bring him. If it'll get us out of here faster, bring him. I just won't breathe today, I guess. Okay. Mr. Business! Mr. B Oh, there he is, up there. Bob, can you get him? He'll jump down if you sing to him and pat your shoulders. Oh, my God. Okay, um No, no, no. Something with a little rhythm. It's got to be jazzy. Okay. All right, all right. There you go. Oh, look at him, he loves it. Ow! Ow! You did it, Bob. Good job. Oh! Ow. Put him in this box. Here, here. Okay. Now, tape it shut. With what tape? I don't have tape! Why are you being so negative? Oh, my God. Ow! I'll find some tape. What are you doing?! I'm making a salad. I told Linda I'd bring one. You were supposed to be getting tape, Gayle! I didn't want to make two trips! Don't worry about it. He's fine in there. He likes it. Okay, let me just find my house keys. They're all separate and not on one ring. Okay, car's not snowed in. That's good. Let's get go No, no, no, no. No! No! I left the Thanksgiving megamix I made in the CD-ROM drive! Ugh. Okay. Gayle, do you have a shovel? No. Uh, a bucket? No. Okay. Um, a bowl? Uh no. Well, the one the salad is in, but I don't have any others. You only have one bowl? I'm not rich, Bob. Ooh! But I do have a whole bunch of kitty poop scoops. Would those work? Not really. Okay, just give 'em Here's one. Here's my good one. That's fine. Here's the purple one. I hate this one. I feel like it's making fun of me. Lin, hi. No, no, no. We're fine. Just the car is buried in the snow. How's the turkey? I mean, how are you and the kids? We're doing good. Everyone's good. We're making up cuss words. aw, finky! That's great. Listen, we're in a little bit of a situation here. Uh, the car is buried and I'm poop-scooping it out, but it's gonna take a little while, so I'm gonna need you to baste the turkey. Wait, wait. You want you want me to do what? Don't worry, you can do it. It's gonna be fine. Just keep it moist until I get home. But, Bob, you always cook the turkey! Just relax, all right? Get out the baster. Tell him not to worry. He'll probably be confused, 'cause he's so used to my voice. Then get some juice from the pan and, you know, squirt it on the turkey. That's what basting is? J-Just tell the turkey I'm on my way. Uh, o-okay, okay, bye. All right, just tell him now so I can hear you say it, 'cause I want him I want to hear what he says. I'm hanging up! I got to go! Bye! Yep. All right. Bye. Bob, happy Thanksgiving. Teddy, great. I-I need your help. My car is snowed in at Gayle's apartment. Is there any chance you could pick us up in your truck and take us to my house? I wish I could help you, Bob, but my truck's in the shop. I've been biking everywhere, like they do in China. Wait, you've been biking? Well, I biked to one place. It was horrible. Also, I'm on a cruise. What?! Yep. Me and Mom. It's a singles cruise. Uh, sock's on the door. I can't go in. Guess it's back to the buffet. A-All right. Thanks, Teddy. I'm having a terrible time, Bob. Uh, I got to go. I don't think my mom respects herself. Bye. All right, Gayle, we're gonna go on foot. But, Bob, I can't. My ankle. Damn it. Right, I forgot. You go. Just leave me here. Okay. Bye. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What? Bob, I just had a great idea. Piggyback. Come over here. Crouch down. No. Gayle, I can't carry you. It's too far. But maybe I could drag you. What's that? It's a kiddie pool. It's so I can shave my legs while I watch TV. It distracts me from the pain. I buy very cheap razors. Uh, it's so sad here. What was that? Nothing, I I'm just thinking of a plan.   All right, snowstorm. You thought you could beat me, but you can't! Hang on, little turkey! Here I come! Bob, were you talking to me? Forget it, Gayle. Just sit there. Okay. We'll be there in no time. Or, like, three hours, probably. Maybe four. I should call Linda. Mm. I'm not comfortable. Gayle, no talking right now. Walking? Bob, you're nuts! Please don't freeze to death in the snow, on Thanksgiving. Oh, I'll be so embarrassed if Dad publicly freezes to death. I hope he freezes with a thumbs-up. That'd be one cool ice cube. Lin, I promise we're not gonna die, but it's gonna take a long time. I think you're gonna have to cook the whole turkey and make the sides, too. What? What? What, what? I'm not gonna cry. It-It's gonna be okay. The turkey's gonna be fine. Bob, I just got used to being a baster! I'm a baster! I-I mean, I-I haven't done it yet, but I was just about to. Linda, nobody wants this to be happening, but we're gonna get through it. Now, listen very carefully Actually, you got to write all this down. All right, you ready? Okay. It's a 16-pound turkey. I was expecting to cook it in three-and-a-half hours. Uh You need to baste it every 45 minutes. And in about half an hour, you need to start checking the internal temperature. Use the meat thermometer. Oh You need to check it in at least three places: the breast, the outer thigh, Uh uh and then the inner thigh. It needs to be 165 degrees by the time it finishes cooking. Uh-huh If it starts to dry out before it reaches that temperature, you must tent it with foil. Okay, okay. Let me find a pen! What?! No, no, no, I got it, I got it! I'll get the kids to help me. I'll get the kids. Yeah, yeah. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, don't do that. Okay, bye! Don't hang up! Lin! Lin! Kids, listen up! Your father is pulling your aunt through the snow because he's a hero. We're all gonna have to cook stuff. Gene, green beans! Is that my new name? It's your name, and it's your job! Louise, mashed potatoes and carrots. Gene, I'm trading you. Never! And, Tina, you're on Team Turkey with me, baby. So it's me, you and the turkey against Gene and Louise? No. I mean, sure. Shove it, sides. Tina, focus. Your father just said a bunch of stuff that I didn't write down. Call him back. No, no, no, no, no. We got it. W-We'll look it up. Hey, is there is there any more room on Team Sides? Tina! Look at me! We can do this. Right, right, right, right. I think we're making really good time. I bet we've gone at least a mile. Hey, maybe I'll enter that dogsled race in Alaska. Those dogs think they're so great, but wait till they get a load of me. That's right, Bob. I can't hear you very well, but you seem happy. Oh, my God. Is this the dry cleaners at the end of your block? Yes! I went the wrong way. Everything looks the same in the snow. Well, at least you're getting some exercise, Bob. Yeah. Good. Great. Here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna take my side in a dessert direction. Perhaps a jelly bean, green bean casserole without the casserole? Yeah. And the problem with most sides is that they aren't dessert. Okay, Mom, I think it's time to start taking temperature readings. Okay. And it says here we need to check the temperature of the stuffing, too. What? The turkey juice gets absorbed by the stuffing in the cavity. Uh-oh! And if it's not hot enough, it can lead to salmonella! Oh, my God! Nine million people die each year from stuffing! No! Sorry, nine. But still. Oh, Bob, my alarm just beeped. Time to take a break and let Mr. Business eat. W-Well, you can feed him. You're sitting. You're there. I'm I'll keep pulling. We got to go. No, he gets carsick! Fine, Gayle. Just please try to make it fast, okay? But maybe don't open the box so much bec Oh, it's fine, Bob. Time to eat, my little low-blood-sugar booger. No, Gayle, he's getting out! No, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! Gayle! Gayle! Gayle! What?! Calm down. You have to find my cat! Okay, look, I'm sure he didn't go that far. We can We'll get him. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Bob, don't talk down to him. Oh, my God. All right. Here, Mr. Business! Good Mr. Business! Use his full name. It's Jim. Mr. Jim Business. Oh, uh, why don't you call him, then? Oh, please. He hates the sound of my voice. Oh my God. Tina, write this down. Breast, 125. Okay. Uh, thigh, 100 and, uh, call it 20. Okay. Uh, this part, 100 and, uh, I can't read it. Got it. Mom, quit poking the poultry. You're gonna let all the air out. Just put your hand on its forehead. Oh, my God, this one's 400. Forget it. F-Forget that one. Okay. That looks right. You say potato, I say hot fudge potato sundae. Well, we do not have enough jelly beans to make Gene's jelly bean casserole, but luckily we have gummy worms, chocolate chips, and who's this little guy? One peanut butter Thundergirl cookie from last year? How did you escape? Die, die, die! Mr. Business! Mr. Jim Business! Wait, Bob, here. This is his collar. We must be going the right way. He's leaving us clues. Fine, but Bob? You okay? Looks like you fell down. I did, Gayle. I did. I need a quick break. No. All right. You're right. I got to keep going. We got to keep moving. That's the spirit, Bob! All right, I'm getting up. Up and at 'em, Bob! Here we go, we're doing this! Bob? Where are you, Bob? I'm here. In the snow? Yes. In the snow. We're not gonna make it, are we? I don't know, Gayle. I think I just need to rest for a minute. Get my strength back. You want a little salad, Bob? No. No salad. Okay, fine. Maybe a little. Here you go. Mm. What kind of dressing is this? There's no dressing. Something must have dripped in it. Oh! Tell me a story, Bob. Not right now, Gayle. Okay, I'll tell one. Once there was a movie called You've Got Mail. Please, no. Oh, my God! This side is brown. This side is raw. I'm getting readings all over the place! This oven sucks! All right, you know what we got to do? We got to turn this bird. Tina, mitt me. Okay, here we go. Just gonna grab the legs and give her a gentle Oh, God! You monster! Do you think your dad'll notice? Oh, now he's my dad? Ah, it's fine. Tell him the turkey was playing with fireworks. It's amazing what they can do with prosthetics these days. No. You know what? Gene, get me a needle. Tina, get me some thread. Louise, get me a drink. Everybody scrub in for turkey surgery, stat! Uh, just a few more minutes, then I'll be ready to go. I'm freezing. Aren't we supposed to share body heat? Uh, I guess we could, uh, huddle. For warmth. Okay. Ooh. Oh. That's actually a lot warmer. I drink a lot of soup. By the way, thank you, Bob. I really appreciate everything you've been doing for me today. I know you don't like me. What? No. No, no, I-I It's okay. I know I'm a little eccentric. Crazy? Eccentric. That's what I said. And I've been a little moody. I didn't notice. It's just, sometimes you meet a guy who likes cats and has great armpits, and then next thing you know, he leaves you high and dry. Are you talking about Mr. Frond? I mean, you probably call him Phillip. No, I call him Mr. Frond. Look, Gayle, I mean, you're you. I am? Yes. Definitely. You're right. Yeah. I know. And that's there's something about that. That's something. Yes. And you're gonna meet someone who's-who's right for you. I mean, the Internet is vast. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. May I fart? Hmm? I have to fart, but I we're huddled, so Yeah, I'd rather you didn't. Oh. Oh. There you go. You-you just did. I did. Yup. I did it again. Yeah, I heard that one. Uh-huh. Um Oh. It's stuck down in my snowsuit. Oh. That one is whew coming up around my neck. Mr. Business! Gayle! Wait, how are you running? With my legs! I mean, oh, ow. Ow, it hurts. You aren't hurt! You were faking it! Fine. I was faking it for attention. What?! Are you serious?! You ruined my Thanksgiving dinner because you wanted attention?! No, I ruined your Thanksgiving dinner because I wanted attention! Oh, wait, is that what you said? Oh. Yes! Mr. Business! Gayle, I can't believe you lied to me! You let me drag you for miles and you could walk the whole time?! Gayle, you're getting really far away. I want to yell at you, so please stop running. No! I'm going after my baby! He's all I have left! Except for my other two cats! Gayle! Oh, God. So tired. So old. Everything's fine! What? Everything's fine. Turkey's great. I just want know how far away you are. But everything's fine. Okay. Well, uh, funny story. Your sister got loose and chased her cat down the street. And, uh, now I can't see her. What? You lost her? Bob, it's a blizzard out there. She could die! It's not my fault, Linda. She ran away from me. She ran, Lin. On her foot. It's not hurt. She faked her ankle injury. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she does that. Wait, what? You knew? No. No, I didn't know for sure, but she does it sometimes. Lin, I've been pulling her through the snow for the past three hours! Look, look, look, she's just upset because of Mr. Frond. What does that have to do with her ankle? Oh, she fakes injuries when she's sad. Or when she's happy. Or bored. Or injured. Oh, Lin, I hate your sister. No, you don't. You love her. She's family, Bob. She's your family, Lin. You married me. That makes her your family whether you like it or not. I don't like it. You go find her, Bob. But take your time. Take your time. What? Everything's fine. Why'd you say ""Take your time""? And what's that noise? What noise? Uh, shh. Turkey's great. Perfectly cooked. Perfectly safe. Wait, what's going on with the turkey?! Turkey says hi. Bye. But no! Damn it! Hey, Mr. Business, wait! Oh, great. Come down, come on. Okay. All right. I'll do the thing. With the scatting. All right? Is that what you want? Here you go. Oh, come on. You loved the scatting earlier. You're climbing higher! Oh, God, this is horrible. But I'm gonna come get you. Yup, I've got to get you. So I'm gonna come up. Okay, I am very high up, but no big deal. I'm just gonna grab the cat, and Good kitty. See? I won't hurt you. I'm your uncle, kind of. Now let's just stay calm and we'll work our way down. Very slowly. Bob? Bob? I'm up here. I found Mr Mr. B Mr. B Uh Uh Oh, oh Oh, Bob. You saved Mr. Business. I did. You broke his fall. Bob? What, Gayle? Are you still mad at me? Yes. No. I mean, it doesn't matter. Did you get hurt? I don't know, Gayle. I landed on my back. From, mm maybe ten feet. So, it's probably fine, right? Let me try and get up. Oh, I can't! I can't sit up. Oh, Bob. Uh, I'm dead. Cut me open and sleep inside me. You and the cat. No, Bob. Let's call that plan B. Wow, Gayle, I can't believe you pulled me all the way here. I'm happy to do it, Bob. I ate all the salad though, so don't tell anyone there was salad. Uh, well, I guess I should make a toast. No, Bob. I want to make a toast. Oh, um, okay. To you. Bob, today you proved that no matter what, family is always there for each other. Even when they drive you crazy. Gayle, no, y-you don't drive me crazy. You can be a real handful sometimes, Bob. Oh. You drive me nuts. But I love you. Well, thanks. And I want to say to you, Gayle, that I was mad that I had to pull you in a kiddie pool today, but I'm also glad that you pulled me in a kiddie pool. And maybe it's good to be annoyed by your family, because that means you have one. Aw, Bob. That's nice. And Mr. Frond was a fool to let you go, Gayle, but we're glad to have you here. So what happened? I thought you guys were doing so good. Oh, he told me the oldest breakup line in the breakup book. ""I have scabies""? No, he said he was going to visit his aunt for Thanksgiving. I mean Wait, what? That's all he said? Gayle, he's probably actually visiting his aunt for Thanksgiving. Yeah, right. Who spends Thanksgiving with their aunt? Aunt Gayle, you know you're our aunt, right? Oh, my God, you think he was telling the truth? Yes! And you think Jacob Epstein was telling the truth when he said he was going on a secret mission to South Russia and he needed to borrow $200 for the taxi there? Uh-huh. Sure, of course. Definitely. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yup. Well, do I feel silly. It's him! It's Mr. Frond! You know what? I will call him back. I'm eating dinner with my family. Aw, family. Now come on, let's ea Look at the food. Look at it. Wow. Don't look too close. Look at me. Oh, God, what happened to the vegetables? Survival of the sweetest, Dad. It's nature's way. Well, uh, they look great. You guys really came through. I mean, you cooked a turkey. All right, let's carve it. Whoa. Comes off real easy. As it should. Mm-hmm. Uh, is this thread? Yeah, what do you use to sew your turkeys? Should we not eat this? Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it. We could, maybe No. I'll eat it. Hey, look who found a plate of microwave egg rolls. No, no, no. Something with a little rhythm. It's got to be jazzy. Okay, all right, all right. There you go. Oh, look at him, he loves it.  It's Thanksgiving   Thanksgiving for everybody   Except for Europeans   It's Thanksgiving   Thanksgiving for everybody   Except for Europeans."
"Ugh. That guy can't still be using the massage chair. He knows we're waiting. We have to meet Mom in five minutes. It's now or never for our chair massage. We all know we're not gonna buy the chair, but we take turns pretending we're gonna buy the chair. All right, sir, let's push it along. Other people want to use the chair. You know w Listen, I've got to get back to work in about a minute, and I've just got to work out this knot that's right here. Uh-huh It's just, you know, it's mall etiquette to share the chair. I'm almost done. Okay, well, it seems like you're real relaxed. Well, I was. Why don't we make it even more relaxing? We can crank up this white noise machine for you. You like gentle rain? (static humming) Uh-oh! Not so gentle. More like a tropical storm. Oh, what's jungle sounds? (birds chirp, insects hum) Caw, caw! Uh-oh. Tidal wave! (imitates foghorn) That's a foghorn. Okay, okay, I'm getting up. What? So soon? I hope not because of us. You know, if I were a kid, I wouldn't be acting the least bit naughty this close to Christmas. Oh Well, you're not a kid. You're a Whoa. Mm-hmm. I'm Santa. You just kicked Santa out of a massage chair. Isn't that a song? Umm, you're not Santa. You're a mall Santa. I'm assuming. Yes, but as mall Santa, I'm required to report on good and bad behavior. And it all goes back to headquarters you know, if you get my gist. To Santa-Santa. Mm-hmm. (exhales) Okay. Seems unlikely. Plus, you don't even know our names. Yeah, we didn't tell you that we were the Belchers. Yeah. Guys! Well, just try and be nice, Belchers. Merry Christmas. Geez. Way to make us feel bad about kicking a guy out of a massage chair. Ah, I feel better. (chair humming) Christmas morning, Christmas morning, Christmas morning! Presents, presents, presents, presents, presents! A letter from Santa? I thought Santa letters were kind of one-way, but all right. Read it already, damn it. ""Dear Tina, Gene, and Louise. ""Per mall Santa number 5748's account ""of the Massage Chair Incident, ""you have all been placed on the naughty list ""and will not be receiving any presents this year. Ho, ho, ho, Santa."" What? Coal?! I got coal, too! Maybe it's fool's coal? It's not fool's coal! Ho, ho, ho. ALL: No! No! Santa doesn't really give coal, does he? You had a bad dream, sweetie. It's okay. Have some eggs. Eat your eggs, come on. I'll eat her eggs. Crap, I already ate her eggs. I mean, Santa knows when you're sleeping. He knows when you're awake. I get that. He's got some kind of sensor somewhere. But I never imagined he'd use mall Santas as his eyes and ears. It's brilliant. We are so screwed. Louise, it'll be okay. I'm sure you'll all get presents this year. Are you, Dad? Are you so sure? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I'm sorry, all of sudden you're a Santa expert? Did Santa grant you an exclusive interview you never told us about? Did you intern in the North Pole as an undergrad? That's not how You know what? For Just forget it. Guys, we can't not have presents. We got to smooth things over with that mall Santa and fast. (""Good King Wenceslas"" plays over speakers) Hello, kids. Belchers, wasn't it? Yes. Hi. Look, I think everyone was disappointed with how things shook out yesterday, right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We provided some ambiance that might have been misinterpreted as annoying, you threw some major attitude. And if someone would have just gotten out of a massage chair earlier, we wouldn't even be here. Oh, so you're worried about being on the naughty list. I'm not worried. I've been great this year. I'm worried that you're worried. Everyone squeeze together and say ""cheese log."" Cheese log. Cheese log. No, we don't need a picture. We just need a couple more Wait, you don't want a picture with Santa? We're almost done. Guys, I'm gonna have to move you along. GENE: Hey! LOUISE: Huh? Wait, wait, wait! Wait. LOUISE: Okeydokey. I'm gonna get to the back of the line! I'll see you in 40 minutes. Hi. Hi. (chuckles) We got, uh, cut off before. What do you say to a little snack? There's a crazy rumor going around that you folks like milk and cookies. (laughs) There sure is, Gene. So maybe while you're enjoying these, which are in no way an admission of our guilt, just something nice that we're doing for you, you forget to tell Santa-Santa a thing or two, eh? Are you trying to bribe us? (laughs) No. Absolutely not. Tina, milk. Aah! Oh! Oh! Soak it up with cookies! Soak it up with cookies! Come on! We need security at Santa's Village. Code Blitzen. Code Blitzen. No code Blitzen, no code Blitzen! BOB: Louise, it's okay. It's gonna be fine. Santa stopped giving you presents ages ago. You have no idea what you're talking about. You really don't, Bob. Thanks, Teddy. It's Christmas Eve. Santa's sled is gonna launch in seven hours. How are we supposed to convince mall Santa that we deserve to be on the nice list if we're banned from Santa's Village? We could write down all the nice things we've done this year and read it to him from outside the village in our best public speaking voices. Okay, there might be something there. We could scratch an apology into the ice in the skating rink. He sits across from it. He couldn't miss it. The Rinky Dink. Of course. Guys. We got to do an ice show, huh? Ice show? Ooh, Ice Capades. ALL: Yes. (whoops) Uh, you really don't need to do an Ice Capades. Dad, you want to ruin Christmas? I-I I don't. You know, I followed the Ice Capades for a season. Like a lot of young guys trying to find themselves. We'll do a little Ice Capading about how good we've been. And that's what Santa-Santa will hear about. Hold on. We could call it Nice Capades. Yeah. Nice Capades. Love it. Oh, my God.  Nothin' better than Nice Capades   On Christmas Eve.  Or Mice Capades. No, no. Spice Parade Capades. Oh wait, uh, Heidi Fleiss Capades. Okay, so, no problem, we just need to put on a full-scale Ice Capades with singing and dancing tonight. And costumes. I mean, that's a lot to do, but it's not like too much, right? Hard to tell, hard to tell. Merry Christmas Eve Day. I got you something, Bob. Um, o-okay. Uh, thanks. Aw. Well, open it. Oh, no. You've never received a gift before. You don't know what to do. No, I-I know how to I know what to do. Just rip it open with your weird grizzly hands, Dad. I don't think Dad's weird grizzly hands are that weird. It's just got a lot of tape on it. A box of envelopes? Right! It's for putting your rent checks in. I thought perhaps that's what was holding you back? Oh. Uh, n-no. It's the stuff that goes in them. The money. Hey, uh, Mr. Fischoeder. You don't happen to own the mall, do you? Own the mall? No. Damn it. I own a minority share of a holding company that owns the debt of the mall. Why do you ask? Do you wish to buy it? Uh, no, but you know that little ice rink across from Santa's Village? The Rinky Dink. Know it? I named it. I named it after my dink. It's very rinky. Hmm. Well, we need to borrow the rink to put on a little show tonight to impress mall Santa. Oh, not a little show. A big show. Oh. With singing and dancing and skating and lights and skating. And music by this mammajamma. I suppose, uh, I could talk someone into letting you use the Rinky Dink for, say, the last half hour that the mall's open. Oh, baby! Yes! I'll give it to you for a song. As in, I get to perform a song. You get three minutes. I need five. We'll kill the mic after four, and I'm not joking. Deal. And my brother Felix will accompany me. Oh, like a duet? Uh no. I'll sing and he'll ice-dance. Question: How provocative can he be? PG-13. I'll rein him in. See you tonight. All right, we got our ice time and one ice skater-dancer. You know, if you need more skaters, there's some guys on my hockey team that could help out. On Christmas Eve? It's a Jewish hockey league. We're the Mighty Schmucks. Don't tell 'em I'm not Jewish. Great. Gene, how's the music coming? Have not started. Started. Good stuff. Tina lyrics. You did some nice things this year. What you got? Well, over the summer, I found a horseshoe crab that was stuck on its back. I flipped it over, and it went back into the ocean. Someday when you need help, you're gonna get it, and it's gonna be that crab. I know. Yeah, that's a sweet thing you did, but it's not nearly enough. It's not? No. We got to wow the beard off that mall Santa. We got to ratchet this thing up. Like ratchet it up how? Like: You didn't just plop the thing back into the ocean, you adopted it, huh? And raised it as your own. But that's not the truth. Screw the truth. I mean, the whole truth is that I kind of kicked it back into the ocean. Its leg came off. We can spin that. Gene, how about you? Well, one time at school on taco day which I don't have to tell you is like having a birthday once a week I let Regular-Sized Rudy have the last taco. And I had to eat burned chicken nuggets. Wait, don't you love burnt chicken nuggets? That's not the point. Ugh, it's nice, but not nice-list nice. There are no presents if we don't make a big splash here, people. And I don't know about you, but I asked Santa for something big this year. Big. Well, what are you gonna sing about, Louise? I got lots of stuff. You do? I do. I mean, I will. Some of the nicest stuff anyone's ever done is what I'm gonna sing about. I'm pretty sure there's a preset on here for 30-minute Ice Capades show. (farting sounds) No. No. Hmm. Here comes trouble. Oh, brother. Hi. Uh, my wife sent me here for costume supplies. I'm glad you're still open. I just need a few things. You hear that, Harold? He just needs a few things. Oh, don't we all. Okay, um, do you have fabric glue? (laughs) Do we? I forget. And purple felt? (Harold muttering) And orange felt and yellow felt. Oh, sure, we've got those things, but it's gonna cost you. Right, uh, well, that makes sense, because I'm the customer. No. Because it's Christmas Eve. On Christmas Eve, we jack the prices way up. We jack 'em to the moon. Why are you advertising that? Also, please don't jack the prices To the moon, Chubs! And there's nothing you can do about it, because it's Christmas Eve, and you need felt. Oh, my God. You know, we're having a hell of an after-Christmas felt sale. Tell him about it! (laughing): But you can't wait till then, can you, Chubs? No, I can't! You know I can't wait till then! I really wish we had another art supply store in town.   LOUISE: Hey, I just want to thank everyone for coming out on your Christmas Eves. No problem for me. Coming off a hell of a Hanukkah, right, guys? Great. Now, let's go out there and convince that judgy red man that the Belchers are good kids. Are we all ready? Almost. I'm not fully squeezed into my (French pronunciation): Ensemble. (zippering) Okeydokey. Okay, we've got to be ready now. Um, Louise? Tina, what?! I'm not exactly comfortable with the whole lying part. Yeah, I mean, we didn't really do the stuff we're gonna sing we did. Do you want presents or what? Huh? No, we do. Right. Right. That's what I thought. Cue the music. Lights! (lights clack on) Oh, it's starting! Who's doing the lights? Couple of Schmucks. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the Nice Capades: An evening of warm and generous acts. And a warm-up act the Brothers Fischoeder. Give it up for them. (piano plays upbeat intro) Thank you! (light applause) Here's, uh, one of my favorite Christmas classics.  When the last present's delivered   And the snow outside's gettin' thicker   So let's open that bottle of liquor   Hey, bourbon, take me home   On bourbon, on vodka, on scotch and on gin   Take me back   Let the North Pole dancing begin   It's my party  (humming) Felix? I told you no! All right, get your game faces on, people. Um, Louise? 'Cause we are gonna rock this mall Santa's world. Um Rock it hard. Uh Louise? What?! Mall Santa's gone. LOUISE: Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No! Where's Santa?! Where the hell is he?! As you can see by the sign, Santa's gonna be right back. We need him! Now! He will be back! Uh, what's going on here? This unhelpful elf knows where mall Santa is, but she's keeping her elfin' trap shut! Louise, calm down. Look, he had to attend to some personal business. Okay, Santa's pooping. No, he's Everyone poops, even Santa. Santa's not pooping. He's shopping, okay? But the mall closes in 20 minutes. He's got to see our show, or we don't get presents. Louise, stay here in case he comes back. Bob, we need to find Santa. Right. Yup. Thank you. Thank you. That's all for us. (applause) No, no, no, we want a big happy crowd for when mall Santa comes back. LOUISE: Stretch. And now Oh. What is this? Stretch. Stretch it out. What is stretch? What? Ooh, okay. Um So, uh where's everybody from? Hmm? You, where are you from? Say somewhere good, someplace funny. Say Nantucket. Oh, Calvin, you've never been good at crowd work. You where'd you get that hat? Your mom? (airy laugh) (squeaky cough) That's how you do crowd work. Santa. Santa! Yeah. Yeah. We found you. We need you. Ooh, fudge! Um, I kind of stopped doing ironic pictures with grown-ups. My lap is not as strong as it used to be. Nothing personal. Drrr umroll, please. (drum machine plays rapid percussion) (grunting) (rim shot) Hey, how about that? Hmm? Anyone can make it look easy, but he makes it look hard! Come on, Mom and Dad. Bring back that rent-a-beard! Sounds like your kids have put in a lot of work. So will you come with us now? You know, it's just that I have so much more shopping to do. I have to get something for my nephew. Oh, Bob could get something for your nephew. I could? That would be great. It would? All right, come on, let's go, Santa. Wait. What's he into? Your nephew. You know. Regular nephew stuff. Well, so, like, is he into sports, or or board games, uh, calendars? Did you say, was he into calendars? I did. Yeah. I don't know. No one's into calendars. I just couldn't think of anything else. I'll do better. Don't worry. I'll get him something good. So the nurse says, ""Rectum? I damn near killed him!"" Well, those are all the clean jokes I know. He's here! We got the big man! Yes! He is here, people! Okay, let's do this! No! You're-you're closing early! I-I'm shopping for Santa! Crap. (piano plays flourish) Hello. This year was a banner year for us Belcher kids. We did so many nice things. Too many to list, so we're going to sing them to you. Take it away, Gene, my brother. (light applause) I did a bunch of nice things this year. But one in particular comes to mind.  Taco Tuesday was the day at school   A day that always makes me drool   But when only one taco was left   I said ""Rudy, friend, you take the rest""   But the only thing left to eat   Was nuggets from the deep, deep freeze  And then those reheated evil nuggets got mad and turned into an angry tornado! Oh! (quietly): I made those nugget costumes. I made 'em a few hours ago. It's no big deal. So I did what I had to do to save the world.  I ate the nuggets, I ate the evil nuggets, yeah!   I ate the nuggets, the evil, evil nuggets, yeah!  So that's something nice I did. And now I'm gonna hand it off to my handsome sister, Tina. (applause) Don't look at the bag. It's not calendars, but if it is, they're great calendars.  I kissed my family on all of their cheeks   Then I took a little walk along the beach   A horseshoe crab was on its back   Nearly having a heart attack   I didn't kick it   I gently nudged it back into the sea   I didn't kick it   It had all the right number of legs when I left it, yeah  The end. (Louise clears throat) Oh, right.  And then I took it home and fed it   And took care of it and then it went to college and now   It's a celebrity chef with all its legs.  Good night. (applause) Lin, this is not going very Breathtaking. It's just breathtaking. Yup. Right. Yeah, that's what I was about to say. And now enjoy the stylings of my super nice sister, Louise. (piano plays flourish) (quietly): Nice job, Tina. I think he bought it. I'm just glad it's over. I feel dirty. That's the spirit. Thank you. Oh.  I did so many nice things I can barely count 'em   I regrew the rain forest, and lost puppies I found 'em   I gave blankets to cold kids and ice cream to warm kids   Shoes to the shoeless, hair to the hairless   But the nicest thing I did all year   Uh nicest thing I did I   The nicest thing I did I  I I I can't do this. (grunting) What? What are we doing? Do I still spin around? What do I do? Oy gevalt. Louise, what's going on? I can't do it. You were right. We shouldn't have lied. Yeah, but I didn't know stopping was an option. Hey, listen, you got to tell Santa-Santa to bring Gene and Tina presents tomorrow. They're good kids. And I don't belong on the nice list. I mean, a nice person doesn't put on a Nice Capades. They wouldn't need to. They would just call it ""Capades."" All right, show's over, everyone. Merry Christmas. LINDA: No! No, no! Louise, wait. You're a nice person, Louise. You do belong on the nice list. Sing it, Bob. (microphone feedback squeals) Um, I Wait, hold on. I want to say something else to you, Louise. You think you're a tough cookie, but you're really just as soft as the rest of us, maybe softer. Yeah. You do nice stuff all the time, but you don't even realize it. Like your constructive criticisms of my secret diary entries are really helpful.  You read her diary   And tell the rest of us the juicy stuff   So we don't have to read it   Keeps our hands clean, oh, yes, it does  And, Louise, I know you don't like watching The Weather Channel, but you sit and watch it with me anyway, so  Oh, she gets bored of forecasts and more forecasts   I don't know why you watch that, Bob, she's bored  When we were walking to school, you told me I should put away my penis before we got to school, and I did.  You told him to put away his penis   And that was pretty cool.  That's nice of you all to say, but it's not gonna matter. You know, I'm turning in my report tonight. (sighing): Yeah. I know. And I want to tell you, this was amazing, what you did here. You know, you may care about what Santa thinks of you, but I think you care more about what you think of you. And I'm gonna say that you're a leader who really thinks hard about right and wrong. And you know what, sweetie? The world needs people like you. Really? And some tough-looking security guys are motioning for me to wrap it up. It's best to listen to them. So, Louise, what do you want for Christmas? What do you want Santa to bring you for Christmas? A pet shark. Uh, okay, I'm gonna recommend the shark. Yes! Uh eh But just in case, do you have a backup? Nope. Well, y (lights clunk off) And they shut off the lights. So, I guess we'll just make our way to the wall and feel our way out. TINA: Everyone grab hold of Dad. He'll pull us. BOB: What? No. No. GENE: Pull us to Christmas! (thudding) ALL: Aah! LINDA: Ow! My fudge! LOUISE: You know, getting presents is nice, but it's not what Christmas is about, right? Look. There's one more for Louise. Give me! Give me! Give me! ""A special present for a special kid. Santa."" Aw. A goldfish? It is a goldfish. Look at that! Way better than a shark. Very funny, Santa-Santa! Ha, ha! You're hilarious! I get it. I get it. You got to be ten to get a shark? Is that it? Okay, I can wait. Starter shark. Love it. Next year, though, I want a great white under the tree. Did you hear that? I think I just heard him say, ""No way."" Shh, shh. Dad, you don't know anything about Santa.  Oh, bourbon   Oh, bourbon   Oh, bourbon, oh, bourbon, oh, bourbon   Oh bourbon   Oh, oh, oh, oh!  Everybody now.  Oh, bourbon   Oh, bourbon  Come on, now. Let's hear it.  Oh bourbon!  Yeah. Give me another one. Okay.  Oh, bourbon, bourbon   Bourbon, bourbon, bourbon, bourbon, bour"
"Louise Belcher. Phillip Frond. So, you're in trouble again. Drink some cranberry juice. What? No. Not urine trouble. You are in trouble! This is the third item you've brought this week that's disrupted school. First, it was the fake eyeball. Aah! Then it was the piÃ±ata. Tator-tot-a-piÃ±ata! And now the grabber. This goes over here. Stop it. And this goes over here. Stop it, Louise. And this will be easier over here. Stop it! You have clearly violated the ""three gag items and you're out"" rule, so I'm going to have to give you detention. Detention? Sure. Worth it. Now I'll just take my grabber back, and Ah, ah, ah! Also, there's someone here who wants to talk to you. There is? Yes. Me. Distracts-His-Friendzo-Lorenzo. Oh, no. Why do I disrupt-a everything? Jeez, where do you get these dolls? The Super Weird Therapy Doll Outlet? Hey, I made him. I knitted him. You watch-a your mouth. Okay, well, I'm just gonna take my grabber, and I'll see you in detention. No, no, no, no, not-a so fast! You think I'm just gonna give this back to you so you can distract more students? Uh-uh, sister. This is going into my satchel. I'm taking it home. What?! Oh, no, it isn't going in your satchel. Going in-a the satchel. Not going in the satchel. One-way ticket to-a satchel town. No, round-trip ticket back to my hand! Hope it had fun. And satcheled! No! Gene, can I practice my Spanish with you? Â¿Como estas? Me llamo Tina. Sounds great. You did it. Hey, Louise. You're home late. You get detention? Yes! But that's not the point. Frond took my Abumi-guchi grabber home with him! He stole it! Louise, I told you bringing that grabber to school was a bad idea. Es no bueno. Cheer up, Louise. It's Friday. Let's do shots! Hey, who's got crazy weekend plans? Well, tonight we're having my sister Gayle over for dinner. She's got some new mystery man, and things are getting serious. Wow. Spicy. How long they been dating? This will be their second date. Oh. Yeah. Longest relationship Gayle's ever had. So, uh, that's everyone who's coming. Yup. Nu-uh! Dad's bringing a date, too. His name is Steve, and he's a boy. Gene, hush! Steve? Bob invited Steve? The guy who was in here the other day? Mr. Interesting?! Wow, that's interesting. I'm very excited about this standing rib roast. Does everything have to be about your wiener?! He knows. Bob, he knows. What? So, Bob, Steve? Huh? Steve. Little dinner party? Yes. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well, he's recently divorced and probably looking to meet new people, so I invited him over. Yeah, yeah, I-I'm divorced. Everyone's divorced! Well, also, he's an archeologist. Oh, really? Yeah. Like Indiana Jones. So I'll be friends with Indiana Jones. Man crush. Man crush! It's not a man crush. I think it's nice Dad is making a new friend. Do you, Tina?! Yes. Sorry. What I meant to say is, I currently have no plans tonight. That can't be right. Oh. Well, Teddy, I mean, Steve's bringing his son, so, you know, it's gonna be, like, a boring, family-type thing. Son? What son? How old is he? Here, draw his body type. Go. You know what? I just remembered. I do have plans tonight, with Charlie from the union. And he's pretty cool, too. That's good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I think he's calling right now. Charlie. Teddy. What's that? Teddy. Bobby, can you please hold on? I'm sorry. Your phone didn't ring. Dang, I'm on the phone! Right, right, right. Okay. Really? Oh. Ugh, these forks are dumb. They look dumb. Why did we buy these? Oh, my God, it might be him! Hello! Oh, it's just Gayle, everyone. Okay. So, where's the mystery man? Oh, he's running a little late. He got held up at work. Or maybe he's dead! Oh, God, he's dead! Okay, okay, calm down. It's just, I've never been on a second date before that the other person knew about. Oh! Why did he say yes? Is he gonna rob me? He's going on a second date 'cause he likes you. Do you like him? I think so. I mean, he checks a lot of my boxes. He's a man, he's got a face, he can go outside. Lock him down! I just wish there was a way I could know for sure that we were meant to be together. Like a sign. A sign? Like what? Oh, you know, the usual. Like if we both got struck by lightning at the same time, or if an eagle landed on his hand and whispered my name. Yeah, that's how you know it's real. Or if he made me a gift. Like, Linda, when we were kids, Alfie Constanelli made a portrait of you out of his own hair and toenails. Ew. Yeah. I'll get it! Aah! It might be him! Hide me! Wait. Don't hide me. Give me a makeover, quick! Everyone, this is Steve. Hello. I'm Gayle, and I'm on a date! Oh, okay. He'll be here any minute! All-all right. He smells like pencils! Thank you, Gayle. These are my kids Gene, Louise, and Tina. They're okay after you get to know them. Nice to meet all of you. This is my son Teenage boy with it going on. Teenage boy with it going on. Zander. Greetings. Huh. You're, um So, that's you. Hell-o. Chitty chitty bangs bangs. So, uh, Steve, do you want you want something to drink? Do you want wine? We have wine. I-I bought it. Okay. It was sort of expensive. It is wine. Easy, Bob. Bob. Mm-hmm. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. E Easy. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Take it down a notch. Take it down a notch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, uh, nice to have you over, Steve! Well, I'm just trying to get back out there and make new friends after the divorce. That's also the title of the book I'm reading. Get Back Out There and Make New Friends After the Divorce. Oh, that sounds good. What's it about? Never mind. That's got to be him! Phillip! Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Hi, Mr. Frond. Uh This is the guy, Aunt Gayle? This is the guy?! Wait. You all know each other? Um, Louise, Gene and Tina are students at the school where I counsel. Yeah, you know what? Let me just get the door here. Just gonna Uh Ow! close this thing. Hey. Ow, my foot's caught in it. Let go of it! My house! Ow! My home! Okay, I know Mr. Frond isn't exactly our favorite person. Great talk. Now let's kick him out. Dad, get the broom. Hey! We are not gonna ruin this for Gayle! She needs this! She is one cat death away from moving in with us! Your mom's right. We can't ruin this for Gayle. Yes! But more importantly, we can't ruin this for me. This dinner party will proceed smoothly! I believe in you, Dad. You're a great entertainer. Like a sweaty Martha Stewart. Can we talk about the game plan for the rib roast? It-it'll be a little while, Gene. I'll take my half now, whatever state it's in. It's not cooked, Gene. It's raw. I do not mind. Anyway, just so we're clear, do not mess this date up! Fine. Secret post-meeting kid meeting. We got to mess this date up. But, Louise, even though Mr. Frond gives us detention all the time and is awful, that doesn't mean he won't make a great guidance counselor, slash, uncle some day. Ugh! Tina! Don't you speak those words! Uncle Frond? Sick! Our lives would be so intertwined. And the dolls. God, the dolls! Yay! Aah! It's a nightmare! Those dolls would be our cousins! Gene gets it. Tina, you in? Uh Okay. Good. Now let's talk strategy. We got to be subtle. So, should we convince Aunt Gayle that Frond's in the Mafia, or that he is a witch? Mafia witch! Nice! Well, this is fun! So fun. So fun. You know, I'm only ten, but I'm a very mature ten. That's nice. In the lips. Oh, um I have to go help my dad. Um, I think I smell something, um, spilling. Ugh. Damn. Back again. Hmm. Well, I checked on the rib roast. Still gonna be a while. But that just gives us more time to talk! So, Steve, Mr. Archeologist, is life for you just like one long Indiana Jones movie? You know, I get that a lot. It's not like that at all. Right. Right. I'm sorry, but that movie is to archeology what Pretty Woman is to prostitution. Who was a prostitute in Pretty Woman? They all were, honey! Oh. Hey, how about some more wine, huh? Ha! Mr. Frond, you haven't touched yours. Oh, I-I'm not really much of a drinker. Okay, okay, okay, okay. There he goes. So, how'd you two meet, huh? Phillip and I go to the same cat salon. Ooh. I took Dr. BoJangles in for a blowout, and there she was. That's funny, coming from a Mafia witch! A what? It's a witch that's in the Mafia. Don't play dumb. Abort. Abort. Not working. I'm pretty sure they bought it. Let me handle this. So, Aunt Gayle, Phillip here is a real rule hound. Aren't rules the worst? Yuck, right? No, I love rules! I make 'em up for myself all the time. Like every time I eat a ham sandwich, I have to send $100 to a pig. Or if I stay up all night, I won't die. Your rules rule. Oh, Phillip! Hmm. Steve, I-I don't think all archeologists are Indiana Jones. So, Phillip, what is it that you do at the school exactly? I-I Sorry. What? No, you-you go. What? Go ahead. No, I I Did you want to say something? I I didn't mean Phillip, what was it you were saying? Forget it. I am a guidance counselor, but I prefer the term ""Emotion Coach."" Oh. You know, Zander's received some counseling since my wife and I separated. We've run into a few problems that rhyme with schleptomaniac. I'm not a kleptomaniac! Where'd my coaster go? Divorce is very hard for kids Zander's age. I will often do divorce counseling for kids whose parents aren't divorced, 'cause, you know, I can tell who's not gonna make it. So, Mr. Frond, is it true that you've got a monkey butt?! I heard that. Kids! Well, monkey butt or no monkey butt, Phillip here is, like, super tightly wound, Aunt Gayle. Like, so much wound. I'm tightly wound! Sometimes I scream into a pillow. I like to cry into a loaf of bread while I'm eating it! Ah! Louise, can you please go away and come back with a smile on your face and no words coming out of it? Thank you! Sure! Good. Good. Sure. Ugh. At least I can get my grabber back. What the? ""Dear Gayle, to commemorate our second date, ""I made this doll out of the yarn from my dead grandmother's shawl."" Oh, no! What is it? I think it's supposed to be Aunt Gayle. Well, then who's that lady in the living room? You guys, don't you see? He made her something! Gayle might think this is one of her sign things! If Frond gives this to her tonight, it could seal the deal forever! We got to hide this doll until we've successfully broken them up. But, Louise, Aunt Gayle and Mr. Frond are actually pretty good for each other. They're so crazy, they just might work. Tina, you sound ridiculous. Now listen up. We've been targeting Frond, but Aunt Gayle's the one that's scared of all this dating stuff. We got to convince her that love will destroy her. Gene, we're gonna need some instruments. About time. Tina, you're taking Spanish now, sÃ­? What? You're taking Spanish now, yes? Oh. SÃ­. All right. Let's sing this romance into a no-mance, people. Ugh, still not done. Hey, so things are going pretty good out there with me and Steve, right? Uh no. I know. I know it's bad. I don't get it. Well, he's kind of a dud. He's not a dud. He's an archeologist and he's amazing. Ugh, Teddy keeps texting me to say he didn't mean to text me, he meant to text Charlie. Listen, Bob, I think you're just coming on a little strong with Steve. You got to play hard to get. You think so? Yeah. Give him a bit of a chase. All right. I-I can do that. That's it. You want some of this? Yeah. Well, you can't have it! And we all looked at each other, and we just smiled. Wow! Was that too loud? I do not usually drink. But I do now! Anyway, that was the most exciting dig of my whole career. Crap. I missed his story. Steve, what was your most exciting dig? Oh, I was just saying that Bob, no. Never mind. Uh, he doesn't want to hear it. Yeah, I got my own stuff going on. Ladies and gentlemen, if I can have your attention. We would like to serenade all of you tonight What? No. with an old Spanish ballad entitled ""Amor, Por Favor."" I will translate.    Buenos Dias, Como estas  Love is like a beautiful flower. Oh  Me llamo Tina  But it can also be dangerous, like a tiger with a gun. I don't think that means that. Louise  El perro es grande  I mean, look at Steve. Divorce. Pain. Nothingness. Sorry, Steve. No, no. It's true.  Â¿Donde esta El baÃ±o?  Stay single forever, protect your heart, avoid guidance counselors. The end. El singer is muy caliente. Oh. Must be right if it's in Spanish. Wha? Well, I'm gonna go check on that rib roast again. A-And I'm going to go get something. A gift! W-wait! Don't go! There's another verse! Come back! Gene! Tina! Uh  La la la la Spanish la la la  It's gone! You took it! Took what, Phillip? Whoa. How do people drink and then move around? Oh. I got to throw up. Louise! Who's hungry? Me! Phillip? You all right? He's fine. Yeah. He sounds good. I know this might be a bad time, but dinner's ready, so if we could just all make our way toward the table You go ahead! Um, has anyone seen Zander? I didn't take anything. Wait, what? But you took my breath away. So, we have had a wonderful time, but we are No-no-no-no-no! Don't say you're gonna leave. Look, Steve, I was acting weird before. That was Linda's dumb idea. Hey. But I don't want to play games with you. Aw. Uh So just come have some of my rib roast. Let him go! I'll take his! Gene. O-Okay, we'll we'll stay. All right! This is a great dinner party! Phillip, keep keep doing your throw-ups! Come out when you're ready. Ah, ah. Where do you think you're going? To Rib Roast Junction! Toot toot! What did you take from Mr. Frond? She took my dead grandma shawl doll! Dead grandma shawl doll? What the hell is that? It sounds weird when you say it. Oh, what's the difference? I blew it. I'm never gonna find anybody! Maybe I can knit myself a wife. You could call her Yarnessa. Louise! You are gonna give back that doll thing right now! Okay, hear me out Look at my eyes. Ah! You see how crazy they are? Now! But it was right here! Okay, Louise. Here's what's gonna happen if you don't produce that dead grandma doll whatever. You're gonna be so grounded you're gonna grow roots, Miss Missy! Yikes! Ah! Oh, and the chores! You're gonna wash the kitchen floor, the bathroom floor, the basement floor, all the floors! So many floors! Is anyone kind of excited about how clean our house is gonna be? Mr. Frond? You ready to come out? Gayle's waiting for you. Okay, he's not ready. There you go. And a little sauce. So Mr. Frond is gonna be a little while in the bathroom. What a cutie he is, huh? I can't get the English version of that Spanish song out of my head. Oh, boy. Oh, my God, I'm gonna die alone! There she goes. Steve, how's the food? Do you love it or do you love it? Oof. Oh, no, you look bad. Is there cream in this sauce? In the crÃ¨me fraiche? Uh, yeah, a little bit. Okay, do you have a bathroom without a man in it? We have one in the restaurant. I can let you in. But here's a little rib roast without sauce on it No, absolutely not. We got to move. Yup, got it. Quicker. Quickly, please. Oh, God! Much quicker than this! My keys! I can't get 'em off my I-I don't understand. I put the doll right there. Well, where did it go? Maybe it finally became a real girl! Zander! What's shakin'? Those cargo shorts are looking awfully full, buddy. Uh thank you. We know you took the doll, Zander. Empty your pockets. Um, I would love to, but, uh, it's so cold in here, I should get a sweater from the car! Klepto's on the move! I'm not a klepto! Oh, hey, guys. Um, nothing at all in my pockets, by the way. You were asking about that before. There's the doll! In the storm drain! What? I don't think so. Hey, do you ever just want to stomp? - Your street - No! Good for stomping! No! Stop it! No! No! No! Stomp! Eh, it's all right. Steve? Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were crÃ¨me intolerant. No need to talk to me while I'm in here, please. Right. Well just, you know, take your time and You're still doing it right now. I know. I'm sorry. It's, uh, like So you're still there, right? You're still out there? Yes. I don't know why. I-I am. Perfect! Now the doll's gone and we're all getting grounded. Wait, are we getting grounded, too? I thought Mom was talking to you. Yeah, she was making a lot of eye contact with you and saying your name a lot. Oh, fine, so it's all my fault just because it was my idea to take the doll and break up Frond and Gayle and sing a Spanish ballad about the dangers of love. Sure! Blame me! Okay. Okay. It's your fault. You need to work on yourself. Don't you dare. You're squeezing my cheeks. Wait a sec. What's wrong with me? This is great! The doll's gone, Frond can't give it to Gayle. Zander will confess that he got rid of the doll, and Louise a-no-get-a grounded. And why would I confess? Because in return, you will get a kiss with Tina. Oh, my. What? Interesting. Uh-huh. Yeah, let's do it. I will just prepare my mouth. Uh-uh-uh. Confess first, then kiss. Half now, half later. All later, none now. Okay, fine, but no tongue! I'm only ten and I'm not ready! Deal! Louise. What? Why are you looking at me like that? 'Cause you got to kiss a klepto? I'm not a klepto. Then what? Cut it out. What? You think I should want Aunt Gayle to be happy because she's our aunt and we love her? You're saying I'm being selfish?! A selfish brat?! Is that what you're saying?! Oh, gosh darn it! Son of a bitch! Damn you, Tina! You're right, okay? You don't have to yell at me! What's happening? Tina, take it easy. But how are we gonna get the dang doll out of the sewer? I know how. Just a quick walk-by. That's not weird. A walk-by and a ding-dong ditch. Huh? What's going on? Oh. Hey, Teddy. Uh, Steve needed to use the bathroom. It's a long story. Oh, me? I'm just coming back from an amazing night with Charlie. We, uh, whoa we did it all, you know? We Talk about wow! Anyhoosie doosie, how's your night going? Not great. Not great? But you made rib roast. It kind of sort of gave Steve diarrhea. Like, right away. Oh. Also, I just don't think he's that into me. Not into you? Not into you? He's in there?! Teddy Hey! Listen up! Steve! Okay, now we got another person talking to me? Uh, Teddy, it's okay, please No, no, no, no, Bob. Let me talk. This guy out here invites you to dinner in his house, he slaves over that beautiful rib roast, and you're not into him? Who do you think you are, Indiana Jones or something? I'm not Indiana Jones. He doesn't like that comparison. What are you, too busy fighting Nazis? - Well, guess what? - I don't fight Nazis. Then you don't deserve him. He's an amazing guy, and he makes really good burgers, and he's my friend! Teddy thanks. Whew. Got a little worked up there. My therapist says I take these things too seriously. Made a lot of calls to her tonight! Oh All right, where is everybody? Louise's head is in the sewer! Louise, what are you doing? Get your head out of there! Mom, Dad, no! She's in the gutter for a reason. Is that my spatula? Is that my necklace? Weird, very weird. Got it! Whoa! Whoa! Is that me? Yes.

I did. Louise Belcher. Hero. He he made it? For me? It's one of the signs! Oh! Don't touch it, don't touch it. Oh, she's touching it. I love it, I love it, I love it. Oh, I love it! Steve, do you maybe have something you want to say to Bob? I-I guess I've been a little standoffish tonight, and for that, I'd like to say that I'm sorry. And then, Bob, do you want to say anything to Steve? Yeah. I mean, I may have been a little overeager about this dinner party. Will you two just hug already?! Okay, fine, I'll get in on it, too. Uh, Teddy, let go. Uh, Zander, you ready to hit the road? Wait for me, Tina. Probably not. I'm keeping your retainer! Oh, I kind of need that back. No, you don't. You're perfect the way you are!

Still still romantic.  What are you raising the money for?  That's TBD. Either to help end hunger  or re-pave the faculty parking lot.  Those are the big two.  Yeah, Sophie's choice.  Sophie Martinson is the treasurer  of the student council.  And we treasure her.  So, Dad, hopefully we'll sell all 250 carnations.  Okay. Why are you saying that to me?  Because you said two weeks ago  that you'd pre-order them for me.  I I did?  Yeah, I remember that.  I offered but you said, ""No, Linda, I got it.  I'm on this."" And then you seemed a little huffy.  And then you walked away.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  You did pre-order them, right, Dad?  Yes. I did. Pre-order carnations.  Way way before now  Since Valentine's Day is on Friday.  I-I, uh, I-I need to go.  Where are you going?  Just to ah, move around.  Sitting is, uh, is bad for you.  I mean, it's bad for me, it's fine for you.  Good!  Good morning, Wagstaff.  Lunch today will be chili.  The Donations 4 Carnations fund-raiser is this week.  The weather forecast is meh.  The water fountain next to the boy's bathroom is out of order.  If you must drink water, do so at these fountains:  the one next to the girl's bathroom.  The one next to the 5th grade classroom.  The one in the cafeteria  Oh, my God, I can't take it anymore!  Gene!  This is torture!  That is for-sure.  Yes!

"1  Oh, oh, he's got one.  False alarm.  I really thought that was gonna be it.  Wait, wait  Huh?  (groans)  You know, like, ""Say cheese.""  It comes with cheese.  Yeah, it's really good.  No, it's not.  It's just a cheeseburger.  Cheese on a burger?  You broke it wide open, Dad.  Well, it's better than the ""Let Us Catch Up Burger.""  With lettuce and ketchup.  So you're in a little slump.  You know what you should do?  Take a walk to the store and look at some produce.  Maybe you'll get inspired.  Yeah, maybe I should.  And if that doesn't work,  just take peyote, like in the old days.  Right. (bell jingles)  Maybe something pickled.  Pickled something  Ugh, what is wrong with me  (grunts) Ow!  MAN: Are you okay?  No. Ow.  Oh, I went down pretty hard.  Oh, uh, Bob?  Jairo? Oh, come on.  I thought I recognized those whimpers of pain.  (groans) God, why is this sidewalk so slippery?  Oh, it is excess sandalwood oil  I use it for massage.  So you dumped oil onto the sidewalk?  You make that sound bad.  People will fall, Jairo.  I just fell. You did.  You fell down, go boom.  (groans) Ugh, I think my shoulder is broken.  It's not broken.  If it was broken, you would know it.  Oh, don't say that.  That's just something people say.  I'll see what a doctor says.  It's not broken.  If it was broken, you'd know it.  It's a torn labrum.  Oh, my God, a torn labrum! What's a labrum?  It's the middle part of your wiener. No!  Close. The labrum is cartilage in our shoulders  that helps us do movements like this and this.  All right! (chuckling): All right.  Well, I don't do a lot of high-fiving,  but I'm worried I'm not gonna be able to cook.  Oh, you should. I should what?  You should high-five.  Okay.  So when will I be able to do that and cook?  Right after the rehab  that's right after the surgery that you need.  Wait, I need surgery?!  (chuckling): Yeah.  Sandra!  Sandra!  Sandra!  Sandra! Gene. Sandra!  This is fun. It is fun.  Sandra!  Sandra! Louise. Sandra?  (chuckling): Where is she?  Sandra! Sandra!  Were you guys calling me?  Hey, look, it's Sandra.  So I checked your insurance,  and your deductible is high. How high?  Really high, $6,000 high.  Ouch. I mean, totally worth it.  But you slipped in oil, right? Yeah.  And someone poured it there? Right.  Just sue the guy.  I like Sandra.  Sandra! (laughs)  I don't know.  I don't want to sue anyone.  You know what they say  ""If you don't sue, shame on you.""  I don't think people say that.  If you don't sue, shame on you.  Oh, so people do say that.  Listen, your case is very strong.  I'm sure we can sue Jairo for damages, lost wages,  pain and suffering the deluxe package.  I say we ask for 300,000, settle for two.  $200,000?  Jairo doesn't have that kind of money.  He's mystical and handsome, but he's not rich.  He's rich in abs.  N-No, we only need, like, 6,000.  I see. I'm thinking maybe my hourly rate  would better suit this suit.  (chuckles) Get it?  (chuckles) This guy.  I like it.  Um, uh, that could work.  All right, what I can do for you  is encourage Jairo to pay for your surgery  with a strongly worded letter on my letterhead.  Interesting.  Just sending a letter could work?  Well, you'd be surprised how many doors  a letter from a lawyer can open.  Or close.  It seems like you're talking slower,  since you started charging by the hour.  (slowly): No, this is the speed I talk.  But that reminds me of a funny story.  Oh, I want to hear a funny story.  (chuckling): Once when I was in law school  (laughs) No, no, no, let's not tell stories.  We should go. We're off the clock.  Thank you. Bye. Bye.  ""It Takes Bun To Know Bun.""  Served on a fancy bun. Huh.  I don't want to talk about it.  Me neither.  Bob, this letter says I am liable for your labrum.  I am liable for no one's labrum.  Look, I really didn't want to get a lawyer involved,  but unless you pay for my surgery,  we're gonna have to sue you.  Hello, Jairo.  I see you're looking tan and perfect, as usual.  Good for you. Thank you, Tina.  So, Bob, who said you need surgery?  My doctor.  A doctor? (scoffs)  What does that sound mean?  (repeats scoff) You don't know what that means?  It's, um I think I do, it's just that you're doing it weird.  I am not doing it weird at all. You do it.  (scoffs) That's I'm doing. (scoffs)  (chuckles) That's not (scoffs)  (scoffs) Well, I think you're both nailing it.  Hmm, you look like you are in pain.  (grunts) I am in pain.  Because I fell on your oily sidewalk,  and I can't chop onions or flip burgers or make a fist.  Perhaps I can help.  (inhales deeply) Um  (Jairo grunts) Please stop touching me.  Now try to make a fist.  You made a fist.  I I did.  How'd you do that?  I am a healer.  Bob, let me work with you instead of you getting  this painful super-yucky surgery you so-call say you need.  You really think you can heal Bob?  How about this?  If I can't heal you in ten sessions,  I'll pay for your surgery.  (sighs) Fine.  Ah, the healing has begun.  (groans)  Let me in on that.  Okay. I want some of that.  Okay. (chanting): Heal our dad.  Heal his disgusting broken body!  Is everyone liking the font? Yes? Good.  We have just created the very real-sounding law firm  of Fromage, Schuster and Pitz-Lopez.  We sure we don't want to go with Daddy, Grandpa and the Beaver?  Pretty sure. So what's our first suit?  I think a letter from our attorneys might get Miss Selbo  to back off with all those tardy slips.  Yeah, tardiness happens.  Deal with it, Selbo!  There's the patient. I made you a big breakfast for your healing  I'm not supposed to eat.  Jairo said to arrive with an empty stomach,  an open mind and no underwear.  Dibs on Dad's underwear.  I'm wearing underwear. Oh, boo.  And I'm eating this.  But your mind's open, right, honey?  Mmm, not really. Bye.  JAIRO: Okay, Bob, let's explore your lifestyle.  Describe the color and personality  of your bowel movements. Mm, no.  Just give me some key words.  Are they perky, shy, clingy?  You know what, this was a mistake.  I-I should just get the surgery.  JAIRO (jabbering): Ajabuttabuta  (Bob groaning)  Ah, how do you do that?  Take off the sling crutch, and take off your clothes,  starting with the underwear.  It's time for a massage.  Wait, h-how'd you know I was wearing underwear?  You have underwear face.  (bell ringing) TINA: So, yeah.  Unless you want to get hit with a lawsuit,  you'll be taking these tardy slips back.  'Kay? Sorry.  We're late because we care!  Do you know how long it takes to put this together?  Let's go to work on your shoulder.  (groans) That's not my shoulder.  Before we walked upright, our buttocks were our shoulders.  And I found a knot.  Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow.  You're holding stress everywhere I touch.  There is a knot. (Bob groans)  Oh, a double-knot. Do you feel that?  Yes, pressing on knots hurts a lot. Ow!  Hmm, I wouldn't know. I've never had one.  To heal you, we must heal the stress.  So what is causing all your stress?  I-I don't know.  I guess, um, uh, money?  Money? What a silly thing to stress about.  You silly money goose.  (groans) Okay, so, wait, you don't worry about money?  Don't you pay rent here?  I teach capoeira to make things other than money,  such as fit bodies and healthy non-clingy bowels.  Speaking of which, our first session is over.  Here, you have earned this.  What is that?  The yellow scrunchy of trust.  And here's this.  What's this for?  You are dripping with oil.  I used too much.  The-the little cap came off.  Whoa. Watch your step! Whoa!  Whoa. Oop. Hup! Hey-oh!  Help. Heh-dup, hup-hup!  (door bell jingles) So how was your first day of healing?  You know, actually, my shoulder feels a little better.  That's great. What you got on your wrist there?  Oh, this? I-I I don't know.  I guess I earned it.  Is that a scrunchy? Um, uh, yeah.  Give it to me. I'll put it in my hair. Okay, uh  Well, no, you know what, I'm gonna keep it.  So, Bob, burger of the day, huh?  Oh, the ""Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Tomatoes"" burger.  Is it okay? It's fine.  I mean, it's a burger with tomatoes on it.  Well, that, yeah, that's what I was going for.  Right. Well, you did it.  You're gonna come out of this slump, don't worry.  All great artists have slumps.  Hey, let me be your muse, Bob.  Okay. Look at me. Look.  Mm-hmm. Yeah. What is What are you thinking?  I don't Is anything coming?  Look, look. I think you're  Uh, like you're in an aerobics class?  Shh, sh-sh-shh.  Look at me and think. Clear your mind.  Let it wash over you, Bobby.  I'm your muse, look at me.  And the burger of the day is what?  I-I just don't know if that's the way it works.  Look at me now. Look at me now, what are you thinking? Oh, my God.  JAIRO: This is my body feeling good.  This is my body feeling good.  This is my bowels feeling good.  This is my bowels feeling good.  This is me tickling you.  (laughing): Hey, hey. Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.  Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle. Stop (laughs)  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Whoo, whoo-whoo   Yeah   Cease and desist   'Cause I know I can't resist you, baby   This is not just a chance to run   Or keep on doing my exercises, baby   Cease and desist, 'cause you know I can't resist you, baby   As you can tell by my wrist, I'm gonna keep on doin'   And pop, pop. (groaning)  Again. Pop.  Pop, pop, pop, pop.  (doctor humming)  Uh, Bob? Oh, hey, Doc.  You never scheduled your surgery.  Oh, uh, yeah, I'm, uh, I'm working with him now.  Who are you?  I am Bob's healer.  Uh, my shoulder's actually feeling pretty good.  Okay, but can you high-five?  D-Do you think I'm ready?  High-five away, Bob.  (sighs) Okay.  I did it!  Wow, I've seen a torn labrum blast a fiver like that.  Impressive.  Keep up the good work, guys.  (resumes humming)    ""Labrum-ham"" Lincoln in the house.  What's going on, Jairo?  I've been evicted.  What? Why?  I wasn't supposed to be living in my studio,  but I had to because of what happened with my apartment.  Well, what happened with your apartment?  I was evicted.  I don't get all stressed out about money,  but my landlord does.  Mr. Fishsticks.  Wait, you mean Mr. Fischoeder?  He's my landlord too.  I-I'd offer to talk to him for you, but I'm, uh  I'm kind of avoiding him.  Well, I have no place to live.  I have no place to heal.  Right, you have no place to heal.  But the universe will provide, like a pigeon  who flies into a bread-crumb vending machine.  Do they have those here?  Wait a minute, Jairo  I'm your breadcrumb vending machine.  Guess who's coming to stay with us for a while?  Me? Is it me? Oh. Probably him, right?  'Cause he's got all of his stuff.  Yeah. So, not me, then.  (capoeira music playing)  Hello. Hi.  How are you? (making rhythmic noises)  Good morning, Bob. Join us.  Oh, uh, no, no, that's okay.  Oh, come on, your shoulder is ready for capoeira.  Yeah, but the rest of me isn't.  Well, just try and not move to these rhythms.  (making rhythmic sounds)  Pandeiro! (makes rhythmic sounds)   (makes rhythmic sounds) Rio Janeiro!  Mom! What? What is it?  There's something you need to see.  (gasps)  You married that.  GENE: And now he's Jairo's plaything.  Where's Tina going?  Got room for one more?  (grunting) Can you just, um,  can you move a little? Thanks.  HILDY: ""Our client  is entitled to extra taco fillings.""  What is this crap?  Hildy, do you want this to get  tied up in the courts for years?  Or do you want to just give me the extra fillings  and send me on my way?  Ugh. Thank you!  Did anyone else see Dad wearing sandals  on his feet?  Yes. Yes.  And what is that stuff he keeps burning?  Sage. Sage.  At first I thought it was kind of funny  that he was getting ""healed"" by Jairo,  but now it's starting to freak me out.  Me, too!  I farted up the shower before he got in  and you know what he said?  Namaste.  That son of a bitch.  JAIRO: Mmm good smoothie.  Not too much broccoli?  There is no such thing as what you just said.  (exhales)  All right, let me take a shot at this.  Uh, Bob? Are you okay?  Your buttocks look stressed.  Like they have a test tomorrow.  No, I'm fine.  I-I'm just hoping this smoothie  will help me come up with a burger of the day.  What's a ""burger of the day""?  Well, it's this thing I do.  I come up with a special burger, every day.  People love it. Well, Teddy loves it.  It's been a few weeks  since I've come up with a really good one.  I'm, uh I'm kind of in a little slump.  A new burger, every single day?  But every day is a different day.  Must be stressful.  Uh, yeah, it can be a little stressful,  but I I like doing it.  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  Let's pop that shirt off and dig around.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Yes this makes sense. Wh what?  There's this one knot I can't break up.  Oh! That really hurts.  We've found the mother-knot.  The mother-knot?  The knot caused by  your biggest stress in life  your burgers of the days.  Well, that's crazy. Oh!  Bob, we've finally uncovered  why the universe brought us together.  No, you're you're my healer  because I fell on your oily sidewalk while I was  trying to think of the burger of the day.  Oh, my God, the universe did bring us together!  Then it is settled.  You're going to stop doing burgers of the day.  W-Well, no, I don't know about that.  How about this: give it up for one day.  Let your chalk sleep today.  Leave it on its little sleeping ledge.  Look how cute the chalk.  (whispering): He's so cute and quiet.  He's sleeping.  All right, well, maybe just for one day,  I'll take a break. Shh!  Oh, sorry. The chalk is trying to sleep.  Right.  (grunts)  Red? Yes!  Oh! Sorry, not the red one.  That is Jairo's special scrunchy.  Give it back, please.  Give-give it Oh  (sing-song): But here's a nice orange one  Oh!    Eh, Bob? Yeah?  Uh, what-what's up with the, uh  huh-huh, huh-huh.  Oh, the burger of the day?  I'm not doing it today.  What?

BOB: Bye.  I'm sorry, sir, I know you're enjoying your lunch.  Put a burger on that board!  (bell tinkles)  Uh, why is Teddy walking in the street trying to punch cars?  He's overreacting because I TINA: The burger of the day board is blank!  The burger of the day board is blank!  Ahh!  Your father's not doing it today.  Or maybe ever again.  According to Jairo,  they were ""stressing him out."" But it's blank!  You kids can write something up there if you want.  You know, one of your joke burgers or something.  What?! It's no fun if you want us to!  All right, do it or don't do it.  It's fine either way.  Does anyone want a broccoli smoothie?  No! I hate you!  Maybe a sip!  That's it, we gotta get rid of Jairo.  Time for Fromage, Schuster, and Pitz-Lopez to take over.  (bell tinkles)  Did you put this phony  cease-and-desist letter under Jairo's door?  Give it to me!  Give it to me! Phony?  That looks real to me.  Look at that font.  Roman numerals. Must be real.  Bob, if you wanted me to leave,  you could've just told me.  You didn't have to threaten me  with ""death by scrunchy.""  Kids, did you do this? We're not at liberty to discuss  Louise Fine! We wrote that letter.  But you left us no choice!  You've changed, man. You've changed.  My client isn't going anywhere.  Your client? You're our lawyer.  In the case of Bob v. Jairo, I'm Bob's lawyer.  But in Jairo v. Bob, I'm Jairo's lawyer.  How is that legal?  They're totally different cases.  But what's not legal  is the eviction of a good-looking tenant  who has a verbal contract to stay here for free.  Did you just say ""good-looking tenant""?  That's the law. This guy's amazing.  Tom, I love your energy.  I love your energy.  You're my favorite client.  Uh, thanks.  Kids, you can't go around threatening people  with letters from fake lawyers.  We can and we have.  And it was fun and it worked! Until it didn't.  Well, now we're stuck with friggin' Jairo.  Listen, having Jairo in our basement  is a good thing.  He's helped me in a lot of ways.  He's not just a shoulder shaman.  Why am I listening to you?  Is it because you're crouching?  Yeah, since when have you been able to crouch?  Only recently.  You've changed, man.  And you don't miss  making burgers of the day? At all?  I do not  miss it at all.  I'm totally content.  Yup, yeah, yeah. Fine.  Come on, emergency kids-only  under the table meeting, now!  All right, trying to evict Jairo sort of backfired.  So what we need to do now  is get Jairo un-evicted from his old place.  How are we gonna do that?  By taking our case to the top.  (gasps) BeyoncÃ©?  Close.  Now make me look like a lion.  Mr. Fischoeder, you've been served.  Okay, it'll be ready in ten minutes, bye!  To-go order, Bobby!  ""Four burgers of the day."" Lin?  Yeah. We don't serve those anymore.  Oh, right.  Well, uh, they're coming in ten minutes,  so cook 'em something.  Okay, let's see here now  ""pursuant to Orville vs. Redenbacher"" Mm-hmm.  Blah, blah, blah  ""habeas porpoise,"" blah, blah, blah Mm-hmm.  ""Reverse-evict Jairo.""  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.  Hmm (sniffs)  Blueberry-scented marker.  Mm-hmm. Yeah, blueberry. We pay extra for that.  Well, I smell a fake lawyer in the mix here.  What? What?! How dare you!  You got us. Tina!  Yes. I use fake lawyers myself from time to time.  I once stopped these very wharf workers from unionizing  with a rather playful letter  on a very threatening letterhead.  Interesting. I bet you wouldn't want them  to find that out, would you?  Oh, why did I say that to someone  who wants something from me?  I thought we were cool.  BOB: I'm not doing it.  I'm not cooking a burger of the day.  All right, fine, whatever.  I'm just making regular burgers.  Regular, stress-free burgers. Uh-huh.  You know what? I'll see what's in the fridge  and I'll just slap something on.  But I am not gonna name it.  Great, now I'm stressed.  And I'm running out of time.  And there's thyme.  Huh, egg.  Lin! What?  Linda! What?  Runny out of thyme! What?  Runny fried egg and thyme!  The ""Runny Out Of Thyme Burger!"" Oh. Oh!  It's the best one I've come up with in weeks!  Oh, he's back!  I'm back, baby!  Ha-ha, whoo!  Uh, Bob, will you hold my ponytail  while I do some upside-down push-ups?  Hold on a minute.  What's going on with this?  Oh, I came up with a burger of the day  that I'm really proud of.  I'm confused.  You gave them up.  Because they are stress makers.  Well, they're also happy makers.  Hey, we should call them ""happy meals."" Oh, wait  You were finally at peace,  like a pigeon who found a jar of peanut butter.  Jairo, you know I love your pigeon analogies,  but I think I need to wake up every day  and wrestle with this, and create something.  And that can be stressful, but it's worth it.  There's my Bob. There's my stressful Bob.  Your body will turn back into a knotted, rotted thing.  It will creak like a boat.  I like his creaking.  I know where he is in the dark.  Then I must go. What?  You can still stay here until you find another place.  No. Your your stress will make it all stressy in here.  Where you gonna go?  I don't know.  Maybe I need to change the way I live  buy a jacket  Hit the bricks, Jairo!  You can move back into your old place.  Oh, everything's fine!  No changes for Jairo!  Really, Mr. Fischoeder? You'll take Jairo back?  Well, if it means avoiding another worker uprising  which aren't as fun as they used to be,  now that workers are considered ""people.""  Thank you, Mr. Fishsticks.  That'll teach me to be honest with children.  Good-bye, Belcher family.  And Bob, you earned this.  (gasps) The red one!  Oh, whoops, sorry about that.  I meant to give you the purple one.  Oh. O-Okay.  The chalkboard! It's not blank! It's alive again!  A to-go order busted your father out of his slump.  Yeah, what's taking them so long?  Their burgers are gonna get cold.  Um, they're not coming.  What? They're not?  Yeah, no, there wasn't really a to-go order.  I made it up. And it worked!  I am your muse!  Ha! Muse-dance!  (grunts dancing noises)  But the burgers are real. (gobbling)  Huh. It's kind of weird not having Jairo around.  (door bell tinkles)  Jairo's back.  Totally forgot, I'm supposed  to teach a class right now.  Would it be cool if we  Go ahead. Use the basement.  Thank you, Bob, you're the best.  TEDDY: There's something on the board.  There's something on the board!  Bobby, make me one of those!  But hold the egg. That sounds gross.  And the thyme.  Do you know what? Just do the tomato one!  I'm coming in!  Hoo!   Muse dance!  (grunts dancing noises)   Hoo!   Muse dance!  (grunts dancing noises)    Hoo!   Muse dance!  (grunts dancing noises)    Hoo!   Muse dance!  (grunts dancing noises)  Beh, beh, beh, beh-teh, beh, teh, beh-beh   Beh, beh, beh, beh-teh, beh, teh, beh-beh   Hoo!"
"Yay!  Family TV night.  Chippin' and sittin' and channel flippin'  it's everything we're good at.  Also windsurfing. We never tried it,  but I think we'd surprise ourselves.  I tried windsurfing once. That's the whole story.  Shh. I love this commercial.  Everyone, shh.  I'm the Sofa Queen,  and I'm here to banish your ugly furniture.  This child's bedroom set offends me.  Off with his bed.  Boom! Just like that, he's got a new bed.  That's a futon fit for a fool.  I'm gonna replace it, but with a couch,  because normal adults do not own futons.  Lin? Are you mouthing along with the commercial? Shh!  I command my subjects  to visit the Sofa Queen Furniture Outlet.  Off Route 9 in Bog Harbor.  Boi-oi-oi-oing!  Aw. I love the Sofa Queen.  Her sofas are firm but they're fair.  Uh, Dad? Yeah?  While we're on the subject of couches,  maybe it would be a good time for you and Mom  to have, you know, the talk? Oh.  What's she mean? What talk?  Is this about how messy Mom's purse has been?  I love balled-up receipts as much as the next guy,  but come on! No, Gene.  Um, Lin, you really love the Sofa Queen, right?  Maybe we should go to her store sometime.  Ooh, fun.  That would be fun.  And? Dad?  Uh, and while we're there,  maybe we could get a new couch.  What?!  No, Bobby, no. I love our couch.  It's family. No, no, absolutely not. No.  We're family. And we're sitting on the floor.  The couch smells really bad, Lin.  It smells like memories.  Memory musk.  It smells like if all the food we've spilled on it  had a war with all the butts that sat on it.  I'm mostly getting Dad.  The stuffing in the cushions is all lumpy.  Well your cushions are pretty lumpy, too, mister.  Aw, I love your lumps. Come on, let me t Come on, let me t Ow, ow. Ow!  Mom, there's a damp spot on the couch  that somehow never dries.  Ever! It's always there!  Yeah, like magic. It's special.  Mmm! We have a history  with this couch. Gene had his first throw up on it, 'member?  I remember that happening  in an infinity pool, but whatever.  Tina teethed on the armrest. Remember that?  Yeah, we called the pediatrician to see if couch foam  was okay for babies. He said no.  Aw, he did.  He said she could've choked and died.  And you, Louise,  with your couch forts.  Fire!  Ugh, Mom, we get it.  The couch is just a thing. And when things are old,  you get rid of 'em. Like libraries.  Okay, I think the fairest way to do this is to put it to a vote.  Everyone in favor of replacing the couch raise your hand.  Looks like it's three to two, Bob.  Mom's right, Louise. The couch is family.  You too, Gene? Seriously?  You're asking me to vote against Mom?  I know where my butter's breaded.  That's my boy.  Come up on the couch with Mama.  Come on. No!  I think I'm gonna get some snacks.  Dad, you like snacks, right? You snack, huh?  Uh, sure, sometimes.  Why are you pulling me? Ugh!  What happened out there, Dad?  Where-where were you?  Louise, I tried.  Not hard enough.  Look, we'll get rid of the couch someday.  How? Mom's never gonna give it up.  I don't know, maybe something will happen to it.  Were you serious about the snacks? 'Cause I hid some  fudge pretzels from Gene, if you're interested.  Back up. What-what do you mean, something will happen to it?  I don't know. Maybe something will happen to the couch  that'll make even your mom want to get rid of it.  Right.  Accidents happen to couches every day. Sure.  I bet that's true. Mm-hmm.  Found 'em. Ugh, Gene got to 'em.  And he left a note. ""Checkmate.""  Oops! What am I doing?  Oops, I keep doing it.  Stop.  Yay, family TV night!  Why do we call it family TV night  if we do it every night?  Louise, you sure you don't want to join your mom  over here on the couch?  Uh, pass.  Fine. More couch for me.  Gene! Tina! Where are you?  Get in on this, babies.  First one on the couch gets to pick the show.  You drive a hard bargain, woman.  I want something with adult situations  but I'd settle for mature themes.  Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.  Aah!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my word!  Oh, my God! Couch?  Couch, say something!  Give it mouth to mouth!  Well, I guess we're getting a new couch after all.  Yay!  Anyway. Yay.  The couch was too beautiful for this world.  I'm sorry, Lin. What's that?  It's instructions for whoever wants to take it home, Bob.  Oh. That's optimistic.  ""Good with children. Does not fold out into a bed.  Just folds out because it's broken.""  Oh, my God! What happened here?  The couch is gone, Teddy.  Linda, Linda, Linda. I am so sorry.  Oh, you know, I I-I just keep having  to tell myself it's-it's life.  It is. You know? It's natural.  It is. I got a recliner that's getting on in years.  Might be time to start making arrangements.  Come on, people. Are we gonna stand around all day,  or are we gonna go get a new couch?  Oh, hold your horses.  I want to be here if anyone takes it.  Uh, I can keep an eye on it.  I'll be here all day. Mr. Fischoeder hired me  to do some repairs next door.  The holistic healing place that moved out  stripped all the copper out of the walls.  Hmm. Still smells like incense in there, though.  It's gonna be my most relaxing day of work ever.  Anyway, I'll see that the couch goes to a good home.  Aw, thank you, Teddy.  Yeah, thanks, Teddy! Bye!  Wait, wait, I need to get a picture.  And a lock of its hair.  Ooh, it's my hair.  Here we are. The commercial  doesn't do the place justice. Actually, it does.  There she is. Oh.  Welcome to the Sofa Queen Furniture Outlet.  What can I furnish you with today?  Uh, is the Sofa Queen here? My wife is a huge fan.  I'm afraid she's not, at the moment.  Great. The queen's not even here?  Oh, what's the point of anything?  Well, the queen might not be here,  but maybe you'd like to meet her loyal servant  and brother-in-law, the Sofa Jester.  That's me.  Well, this is kind of fun. Right? Lin?  Maybe. Say what you say in the commercial.  Oh, you mean: ""Off Route 9 in Bog Harbor. Boi-oi-oi-oing!""  Again. Off Route 9 in Bog Harbor.  Boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!  I'm numb, say it until I feel something.  Lin  Off Route 9 in Bog Harbor.  Boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!  One more time. Okay, that's okay.  Thanks. Thanks. No, no, no. We're done. Why? What?  Let's go browse around.  Oh, just browsing?  No, no, we're gonna, I mean,  we're definitely gonna buy something.  No. It's okay, you're browsing.  Um, uh, no. We're browsing until we buy.  I'll believe it when I see it.  Wow. So many options.  It's like a rave for furniture.  Oh, it's Teddy.  Hi, Teddy. Hi, Lin. It's Teddy.  Yeah. The couch, the couch! How's the couch?  Uh, it's okay, it's here with me now.  One guy showed some interest, but he had a beard,  so I moved him along. Ew, a beard.  Shoo, shoo! Some pigeons just landed on it.  Oh! Get 'em off. Get 'em off it! Hey, shoo. Shoo.  Aw, come on, get out of here.  Get out of here! Now pigeons. Pigeons are on it now.  Get off the couch! No, it was  No, no, no, I'm yelling at the pigeons.  You can't tell what I'm doing here?  I'm yelling at the pigeons.  Officer, I'm yelling at the pigeons.  Geez! Mom's got to pull herself together and move on.  Give her some time. She's in shock.  What happened to the couch was such a weird freak accident.  Why are you laughing like that?  Weird freak accident?  Oh, my God.  Yeah. You did that?  Did I weaken the wood under the couch  by shaving it down with the file  Mom uses on your toenails?  No. Wink.  I can't believe it.  Well, you should, because  it was your idea, Dad.  What?! No, it wasn't.  Maybe something will happen to the couch.  I get it You said that.  I said But I didn't mean  You ordered a hit.  You can't unorder it.  I did not order a hit, Louise.  You didn't want to dirty your pretty hands,  but you're not gonna hang me out to dry on this!  Oh, God, here she comes.  This isn't over. It is over,  'cause we're getting a new couch, 'cause I did  what you didn't have the dumplings to do.  Hi, Mom. Hi, Lin.  Teddy said somebody in shorts tried to sit on the couch.  He got there just in time.  That's great.  Well, uh, time to look around.  Look at all the high chairs.  That's the way to live. Why does anyone  use low chairs anyway?  Yeah! All chairs should have safety straps  and pictures of bears on them.  I'm gonna ask Mom and Dad to buy one.  I'm sure I could still fit.  Ha! Good luck, Teenage Mutant Teenager Legs.  Uh, look who's talking, Girth Brooks.  I beg your pardon?  I've been a size six for years.  I bet I can still fit in a high chair and you can't.  What's the winner get?  Hmm. A week of piggyback rides?  You're on.  Uh, uh, uh. Huh?  Let me guess, high chair bet?  Uh Uh  I've seen it before and it doesn't end well.  Sorry, we'll get down. No, please.  I support your foolhardy wager.  We have a ""you break it, you buy it"" policy  and I work on commission.  Wow, what a nice guy.  So this is fun, right? It's going pretty good.  You think so? We've looked at 12 couches, Louise.  Your Mom yelled at three of them and gave one the finger.  Ooh, try this one, Mom. Take it for a spin.  I'll sit on it because I'm tired.  This doesn't mean anything, Mr. Couch.  No funny business.  Well? How does it feel?  Eh. Maybe this one's not terrible.  Come here, come-come try it. Ha!  Yeah. It does feel good.  It's all right. It's okay. Hmm.  Yeah, not bad.  Just browsing? Okay. There you go. Walking away.  All right, coast is clear.  On the count of three, jump into your high chair.  Is this how babies do it?  Fun babies. One  This might be a bad idea.  Two  I take it back, it's a great idea!  Gene, Tina.  Ugh. What does he want?  Oh! Found one you like, huh?  Well, you have excellent taste.  This might be the comfiest couch in the store.  And I'm not just pushin' cushions. Boi-oi-oi-oing!  Mm. Maybe no more boings. Sorry.  Uh, guys, try out this couch. Nice.  This is some real butt candy.  It doesn't drip when you sit on it.  We'll take it. No need to wrap it up, we'll wear it home.  Uh, how much does it cost?  Only $1,399.99.  Kids, get off. Don't even look at it.  Well, n Wait, wait.  I could sell you this floor model for $499.99.  Wow, now that's a good deal.  Boi-oi-oi  Sorry. Thank you.  Mm-hmm. Now there's no returns  and I have to point out it does have a stain on it.  We'll teach it what stains are.  So you'll take it?  Mom, are you okay with this?  Sure. Sure, let's do it. Let's do it.  Terrific! I'll get the paperwork.  And I'm supposed to do my little jester dance  when I make a sale.  Uh, we're good. You sure?  It's quite playful.  Fine.

Wait!  You and Louise killed the couch, Bob!  You Kevorkianed it!  Lin? Lin?  Look, I'm not good at running around things,  so just stop, so we can talk.  Why'd you do it, Louise?  You played God, and our couch wasn't even religious!  Oh, don't you two couch-huggers start with me!  Huh.  That lady looks familiar.  It's the Sofa Queen!  The leader of the Ottoman Empire.  Excuse me. I got to see a sofa queen about a drama queen.  Who is it?  Uh, your Royal Highness?  Oh, my God, it's the Sofa Queen.  Curtsy time! Oh, right.  Is that your wife?  What'd you do to her?  It's uh, it's a long story.  I thought we were getting a snack, and then, I  Okay, okay, okay.

Oh, God.  It hit the puddle.  Looked like he went out of his way to hit it.  What am I being so sappy about?  Sure I liked making couch forts,  but I can make forts with the new couch.  Uh, actually, the cushions don't come off.  Oh. Okay, but the old couch is scruffy.  I mean  we don't keep scruffy things in this house, right?  Are you serious? Oh, right.  Yeah. It's like Scruff City.  Son of a bitch.  We gotta go get it.  Hmm. Sounds like you just said,  ""We've gotta go get it.""  Like, right now.  What are you guys talkin' about over there?  We gotta get the old couch back.  Oh, thank God.  I don't know who I am on this couch.  Yeah! I don't like who I am on this couch.  What?! Oh, no, no, no!  I wanted to keep the old couch, but you told me I was nuts!  So we went through all this, and now you think it isn't nuts?  It is pretty nuts, you guys.  I know, okay? It's just, how can you not look  at that stinky old couch out there and not want it inside?  It's it's one of us.  Yeah! Old couch came out of Mom!  So, you do like the old couch?  No!

Are sleeveless shirts still cool?  We've got to go to the Ear Drum  and see if anyone knows how to find these guys.  Yeah. Or we could just go back upstairs  and think about all the good times we had with the  Come on, we're going! Let's go! Mm-hmm.  Yeah, scope it out. Pay attention to the shirts.  Sleeves?

It's always scraped this and bruised that.  And never epidemic this or outbreak that.  Well, maybe things will pick up.  You never know who's got cooties, right?  (chuckles weakly) Hmm.  A gentleman I've been seeing  says I should be more spontaneous,  so I'm starting right now.  Pop quiz.  Pop quiz?  Ms. LaBonz, do I look sweaty to you?  I'm feeling kind of hot  and vomity.  Well, that happened fast.  Your quiz happened fast.  Fast things happen.  Maybe I should go to the nurse's office,  if I can make it.  I'm so woozy. Oh.  Whoops. Excuse me, sorry.  Am I there yet?  Just go already, Louise.  Is that you, Grandma?  I'm in the barn.  Go.  My inhaler's almost empty.  Tommy LaCroix thought it was an air freshener  and took it into the bathroom with him.  We don't have any extra inhalers, Rudy,  but how about this? Hold your arms over your head  and only breathe when you need to.  Okay. Here we go.  (groans) I needed to.  Oh, hi, Louise.  Hi, I have, like,  a 45-minute bug I picked up first period.  Or maybe it's a popped quizula.  Oh, my God, is winking one of the symptoms?  Yeah. I'm just gonna park it over here  until I make a miraculous recovery after this nap.  (sighs) I'm so sick of people not being sick.  Well, the important thing  is we're here when someone really needs us.  Hello.

I see you.  Hurry up and get better.  No, take your time, ha.  I'm here with Nurse Liz.  So, what are superlice?  - Well Jocelyn, they're parasites. - Ew.  They live on your hair and chew your head and  and then drink the blood out of your scalp  - by sucking it out - Shut up!  Using their little louse bodies as straws.  (slurping) Oh, my God! Stop talking!  And then they poop on you, Jocelyn.  And lay millions of lice eggs. (retching)  I'm gonna throw up.  Kids with lice are bad, right?  (laughs) No, they aren't bad.  But they are disgusting.  And we want to protect their identity.  Unrelated will the following 16 children  report to the nurse's office for a, uh, neck exam?  Jimmy Pesto Jr., Lice.  Lenny Destefano, Lice.  Michael Carlish, Licey.  Tracy Schwartz. Super licey.  So, you'd like to reserve the whole restaurant?  Mm-hmm. For a post-funeral meal?  Mm-hmm. Today?  It's short notice, but the mortician next door  recommended you highly.  (stool farting) Oh.  Sorry for your loss.  Lin, take a break. Oh, sorry.  Uh, excuse us, we're just in the process of,  of, uh, calibrating our, uh, sitting equipment.  Yes, it would be about a dozen people.  Some of them are elderly  and obviously grieving. (stool farting)  Teddy, stop. W-We'll be ready.  By 2:00. Oh, my God.  I mean, I'll, yes.  See you then.  Have a great funeral!  Tammy's selfies sure liced a lot of kids.  Yep, these selfies went viral, literally.  My lice are going over to Andy's head.  And my lice are going over to Ollie's head.  Bye, hello, bye! Hello, bye, hello!  One, two, three oh, God!  That's a lot heavier than I expected.  Louise, I don't think you're supposed to move that table.  But it looks terrible here.  Let's try it by the trash can!  You can't leave, Louise.  It's just a bitter pill you have to swallow.  (groans) But it's not a real pill.  'Cause that would be medicine and I can't dispense  I know, Tina!  You're drunk with lack of power.  There's one selfie  on Tammy's phone I can't identify.  You can see just a little bit of hair and sweater.  Whoever it is could be walking around with lice  and not even know it.  Like I'll never truly know how cute my butt is.  Good news, everyone.  I've found a cure for superlice.  Finally! That's great.  I'm not a hero, Tina.  I'm just doing my job.  I didn't call you a hero. Oh, I thought you did.  I get to go first. (groans)  And I want a reward for being brave,  like a smoothie or a Prius.  So it's quick, all natural, but pretty cutting edge.  Bring on this wonder drug! It's probably hemp.  Yeah, is it a pill or a shampoo I use at home  or just give it to  I'm shaving heads!  (gasping) What?!  Oh, and burning hats.  No! No!  No! My hair and my ears?  Why does everything bad happen to me?  It's happening to us, too, Tammy!  Well, not really, 'cause you're not blonde.  Neither are you. You shut up right now!  You better shut that down. Shut it up.  Um, Nurse Liz, this sounds like pretty aggressive treatment.  Yeah! And, Tina, you get to hold the kids down.  Uh  Anyone comes after me, they're gonna get  an eyeful of cherry throat spray.  Do us! Do us! Do us! Do us!  I heard children screaming from down the hall.  As a counselor, I've learned  that screams can actually be a cry for help.  She wants to shave our heads.  And I don't even know how much to tip!  Well, then that's what's gonna happen.  Mr. Frond, your hair and sweater match the mystery selfie.  Oh. Well, I might have leaned in for a selfie.  I'm on top of trends. (chuckles) Oh, I  I'm-I'm sure I didn't get lice.  Hold him, Tina.  No. (stammers) Please.  I-I have a date.  I have to match my picture!  It's already not very close!  A date with someone besides my Aunt Gayle?  Maybe. (growling)  Tina, you're hurting me.  (screams)  Darn it, jammed.  Before too much of my hair came off?  Oh. Here we go!  (screams)  Crap! Treatment is postponed while I get these fixed.  (whimpering)  Hey, just change the side your part is on and  and nobody will even notice.  (stool farting)  I'm fading here, Bob.  I lost my mechanics.  I'm all up in my head!  Yeah, I gotta take a break, too.  My kegels are givin' out.  We gotta keep going!  Very sad people will be here in an hour.  (bell dings)  Oh, trying to get the farts out of stools, huh?  Yes. You have experience with this?  Yeah. I had a vinyl seat  in my mail truck with the same problem.  Children laughed at me.  Before that, I was the cool mailman.  Mike's right! We can't do this alone.  We gotta accept help from friends.  I don't think I offered to help.  When the Amish wanted to build a barn,  did they do it themselves?  No, Kelly McGillis took a sexy sponge bath  and she got Harrison Ford to pitch in.  The Amish really know how to bathe.  But there's no time. How do we get the word out?  Did someone say ""free beer""?  Where? Where's free beer? Ohh  Yes! I'll make a sign!  After a couple of beers,  this stuff pretty much delivers itself.  Farty party! (stool farts)  LOUISE: We gotta get outta here.  Maybe someone's already dug a tunnel behind that cat poster.  We'll just peel it back and, uh  Okay, no tunnel.  Well, we'll dig one ourselves  with these Popsicle sticks!  Ah, it broke.  Aw, man, people are gonna call me cue ball!  I wanted my nickname to be eight ball.  I haven't been bald since I was a baby.  I cried all the time!  Ugh, and my dad just built me a scrunchie closet.  So I'm picking up  some negative feedback  about shaving everyone's hair off.  Maybe we send kids home,  kick this can down the road a little bit?  No! I'm saving heads by shaving heads!  I'll be the school nurse that beat super lice.  And when I go to my nursing school reunion,  I won't even need a name tag,  though I'll probably wear it anyway  if they have one for me, 'cause why not?  I don't want to be weird about it!  But It's happening, Tina!  I'm not gonna be the only freak around here with a shaved head.  (clippers buzzing) Hey, I fixed them!    (stools farting) Bob, it's working!  I think the farts are going down!  We just might make it, Lin.  Marshmallow is here.  And she brought her rear.  Oh, hey, Marshmallow.  Hey, baby. Ooh!  Okay, where to start?  With Louise. (gasps)  (whimpering)  Oops!  Oh, you've stopped me!  I'm just gonna go right here and plug it right into the wall  Ah! Ha!  Now you're exposed!  So let's talk again  about who's getting shaved and who's g  (clippers buzzing)  Ahh  Oh  And  better.  Eyebrows. That's commitment.  Uh, Nurse Liz,  you look like someone who should be lying down.  Under observation.  She also looks a little like Michael Chiklis.  Come here, Louise.  Uh, Nurse Liz, you're on a roll!  Ah, oh!  Move the table!  Everybody run!  I'm not really feeling up to running okay!  Stop those louse-y kids!  (panting)  So you finally saw the light, huh?  'Bout time!  Yeah, I didn't notice it till she was bald and sweaty,  but Nurse Liz is kind of insane.  Which way do we go?  I can't handle choices right now!  We'll have a better chance if we split up.  Half go left, half go right!  Go! Yeah  Wh Oh. We're the only ones who chose right?  We went right?  I thought this was Never mind.  You go after those two!  Ow! You don't have to push me, I'm on your side!  God! Go!  Follow me! I know this school like the back of my hand!  Yeah, this is where the dead end is.  Good. Good. Good.  LIZ: All right, let's go (gasping)  nice and easy no, wait!  Lice and easy.  Good one.  It's just interesting to see her process.  How long do we have to run?  I'd just like to say you're the last person  I wanted to be escaping with.  Okay, well, I would just like to say  that I am not escaping with you,  we are escaping separately together!  Well, let's just run and not talk, okay?  Fine, stopping now! (growls)  You, down there!  Stop them! No way, man!  They're gonna lice us!  The library!  In here!  The library? Ew. Ew.  Oh, my God!  (panting quietly)  (awkward chuckling)  LOUISE: We can make it out through that window.  Then we're safe.  But Mr. Ambrose can see the window from his desk.  All right, let's just hunker down here  and wait for him to get up.  It won't take long, he hates his job.  What's this?  ""Medical Encyclopedia.""  Oh, God, don't open it  you'll get book smell everywhere.  Thank you. Thanks, everybody.  Thanks for helping.  Mm, man, my cushion did some pushin'.  All right, the funeral people will be here any second.  But I I think we're ready.  Ah, I'm still a little worried about that third stool there.  It was the gassiest one.  What, really? Oh, God, they're here.  (mourners murmuring)  Welcome, welcome.  Sit sit anywhere.  The booths are nice.  I've always been a booth man myself.  They call me the booth fairy.  Uh, sorry.  The counter looks nice. Mm-hmm.  (quietly): Oh, God, the third stool!  Oh, are you the widow?  Uh, yeah, we have a VIP booth for you.  For-for widows. Oh. Ow.  Stop shoving!  No, no, I'm not, I'm helping!  Ow! I'm helping!  Lin. Okay.  Sit anywhere. Wherever you want.  (loud fart) Oh, my.  - (quietly): Damn it! - Sorry, Bob.  Ooh, unless  Hmm. Could be. I-I can't tell.  Teddy, can you get in there?  Was it the seat or was it her?  I'm checking it out right now, Bob.  (sniffs)  It's real.  It's a real one, all right!  Oh, wow, it's a real one!  Yeah, oh, now I'm getting it.  It's definitely her!  LINDA: All right!  Roger would have loved this place.    Huh.  Oh, my God.  Ring.  Oh hello, a librarian emergency?  I'll be right there!  Now's our chance!  LIZ (over P.A. system): Lice alert.  We have re-quarantined most of the infected students.  Oh, no.  Louise Belcher and Tammy Larson remain at large.  If you have any contact with them, turn them in.  And then turn yourself in because you have lice.  She got the others.  Sucks for them.  Okay, let's go! Wait.  (sighs)  We gotta go back. What?! No!  I know, I know.  But I have a gross feeling  that we should help the others.  And I have an idea and I need you.  Which is also gross.  Here's the thing: I hate helping.  I'm out the window! Wait, wait, wait!  (grunting) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Guys, we're in the nurse's office  where Nurse Liz is gonna shave kids' heads while we watch.  This microphone's heavy, I'm gonna put it down.  No, don't do that? Okay.  Hold it, Nurse Wacky!  Oh, look what the lice dragged in.  Really not liking this plan.  I have information.  Tammy is Patient Zero.  But she doesn't have lice  she has dandruff!  Look at it!  Look at the glorious dandruff!  It's snowing!  Old people have dandruff.  I'd rather have lice.  But why are we all scratching?  Dandruff's not contagious.  It's psychosomatic.  The power of suggestion.  Just say the word ""lice"" and everyone itches their heads.  Oh, my God! Stop it, Louise!  Nurse Liz, please read from this medical encyclopedia  the marked passage how dandruff is often  misdiagnosed as lice.  Like how my asthma was misdiagnosed  as having a bad attitude.  Uh, I don't need to read it  because obviously, Tammy has dandruff and lice.  Dandruff and lice?  Mm-hmm. She's a mess.  Oh, my God. That's not good.  Yeah. You can have both.  Oh Sorry.  Darn it, Louise!  I was out the window!  Where were we?  (gasps) No, Nurse Liz, read the book!  It's over, Tina. Read the book!  God, I could read it, but reading?  Ugh!  Right, kids? Right?  Yeah! She gets it.  You can't read it.  Because you don't have your glasses.  What's what are you trying to say?  (laughing): I don't even  I noticed you squinting, then I noticed  the little marks on your nose.  I have them, too. (gasps)  I always thought Tina wore fake glasses to hide those.  Uh wh I I left them at home, okay?  I got in the car and I thought it was gonna be that thing  where I say ""where are my glasses?""  and then it turns out they're on my head.  But they weren't!  They're not, right? No.  And that's why you couldn't have  seen lice on Tammy's head.  (all gasp) Nice one, T.  All right, yes.  Maybe I saw what I wanted to see.  Is that such a crime?  You really want a nurse with no imagination?  - Kind of? - Yes. Preferably.  Oh, screw it, I'll just skip the reunion.  I don't want to show up there with a bald head.  Again. I get it.  You had a zeal to heal.  But you forgot to keep it real.  Oh, can you sign this form so I get my nursing patch?  That's not the right place.  Oh, you can't see.  That's my hand.  So, Tammy, what's next for you?  I do the interviews, Jocelyn!  What's next for you?  No, I have the microphone.  - So, like, what's next for you? - No, what's next for you, Jocelyn,  - in your journey to give me the microphone? - No  - I think it's my microphone. - No, Jocelyn, I'm not kidding.  - I'm doing the news right now. - Give it back. Give it back!  - Just get off it right now! - Give it! Give it to me!  Get off it!

"1  TINA: Rudy's birthday party, here we come.  Yeah, we're coming for Rudy,  but we're staying for the bounce house.  If I die from fun today,  scatter my ashes in the bounce house,  and tell them to keep bouncing.  There's Rudy's party.  Hey, they started bouncing without us. â­Let's go!  Should we drop Rudy's present on the present pile, first?  Let's start a new present pile right, uh, here.  Just get your damn shoes off!  Excuse me, who are you?  Um, we're friends with the birthday boy.  Oh, 'cause last time I checked, this was my party,  but let me check again.  Okay, the cake says, ""Happy Birthday, Dahlia.""  The banner says, ""Dahlia.""  That checks out.  Okay, yeah, still my party.  What is you point, woman?!  You kids have to leave, like, now.  LOUISE: There's Rudy's party.  That's weird. â­Sasha?  Tina Belcher, haven't seen you  since you cost me the King's Head Grand Prix.  We saw each other at the mall last month.  Yeah, I don't do malls; that wasn't me.  Oh, that explains why he kept saying,  ""I don't know you. I'm not Sasha.""  What are you doing here?  Is this some kind of rich kid thing,  where you come to the park and throw money at the ducks?  Ugh, it's my super-annoying cousin Dahlia's birthday party,  and my mom made me come help my aunt chaperone.  You have an Aunt Chaperone?  Between you, me and the trees,  Dahlia is history's greatest monster.  Sasha, nobody's even touching the cruditÃ©.  Go tell them it's rad, or whatever kids say.  Okay, Aunt Caitlin.  See you later, Belchers.  Sasha, don't call these children that.  It's our last name.  Well, he still shouldn't say it.  Hey, guys, thanks for coming.  I'm turning nine, and I'm feeling (inhales) fine.  Yeah, happy birthday. Here's your gift.  It's a holster for your inhaler.  It's supposed to be for pepper spray,  but we realized it could be used for any spray.  Oh, wow, that's so nice.  My birthday's the same day as Ollie's.  My birthday's the same day as Andy's.  Just saying, we like holsters, too.  Hint, hint.  So, uh, I hate to be the guy that's like,  ""Where's your friggin' bounce house?""  (laughs): but where's your friggin' bounce house, Rudy?  There was a mix-up with the rental company.  They thought it was a duplicate order  and only dropped off one for that party over there.  What?! â­What?! â­Can't they just bring another one?  No, they rented them all out.  My dad's on the phone really giving it to them right now.  Mm-hmm. N-No, I-I understand.  (chuckles): T-Totally.  This can't be happening!  Happy birthday, Rudy! Where's the bounce house?  There is no bounce house, Harley.  No!  Oh, it's okay. I don't need a bounce house.  I got my buds, I got cake,  and later we'll be making spoon puppets and putting on a show.  Spoon puppets? Ugh.  Let's hope it doesn't come to that.  Well, they really screwed us here, kids,  and, uh, they suggest we go ask that party  to ""share"" the bounce house with us.  They said that's the fun part about bounce houses,  there's always enough bounces to go around.  Oh, God, this is a disaster.  Hey, it's okay, Dad.  We've got juice and sunshine.  We don't have any juice.  Oh. Well, we've got water.  No, we're out of water.  Come on, I'm sure we can talk that girl  into letting us share; she seemed nice.  No. â­Oh, good. Oh, you said, ""No.""  Yeah, I'm not gonna share my bounce house  with some rando kids.  Uh, thanks for considering.  Hey, same birthday club.  Uh-uh.  Yeah, so we good?  (grunting)  Uh, can I buy some juice off of you?  No, we need it for the after-party.  Do you have any water?  No. (sighs)  Okay, I guess we could always drink from the pond.  So, I have to ask.  I've been here 20 minutes, and I still can't tell.  Is that a real pigeon?  What? Pigeon? What pigeon?  What are you talking about?  Up there, on the TV.  (cooing) â­Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no, no.  So I'm not seeing things.  I got pretty drunk this morning at brunch at the lodge.  Did you know there's vodka in a bloody Mary?  Bob, what are you doing?  Uh, I'm moving away from the pigeon  that's inside of the restaurant.  How'd it get in here?  Did it just walk through the door?  Can pigeons open doors?  Do you mean metaphorically?  In the right situation, I suppose.  (pigeon coos) â­(gasps)  God, Bob, I've never seen you so afraid of something so tiny.  It's not tiny. It's like a small eagle.  All right, well, calm down.  I'll shoo it out.  Teddy, open the door. â­Got it.  I guess, Bob, you keep cowering. On it.  Come on, Mr. Pigeon, come on.  Mr. Pigeon, come on, out.  (screaming)  Thanks for scaring him toward my face!  Bob, what are you doing? You're freaking him out.  I'm gonna go to the kitchen.  Not 'cause I'm scared, but because I'm the cook.  Yeah, right, you don't look scared at all.  Is it still out there?  Yes, it's still here, sitting on one of the stools right now.  It's a stool pigeon.  (both laughing) Stool pigeon.  Will you stop having fun with this?  Good thing we have these spoon puppets to fall back on.  Everybody, pull up a seat and let's get spooning!  This is unjust.  Hey, look what I made, a robot.  Ugh, Rudy, you have been so wronged here,  on your birthday.  We can't allow this to happen.  We're getting in that bounce house.  But Dahlia already said we can't share it.  But she didn't say we can't steal it.  (gasps)  But wasn't that kind of implied?  Oh, my God, a bounce house heist!  GENE: We should be filling that bounce house up with farts,  not them.  I bet they're not even farting.  Don't worry, tell your butts we'll be in there soon enough.  Or, hey,  maybe we don't steal the bounce house, eh?  Oh, Rudy, stealing is the best part of any birthday.  Is this the first bounce house you've ever stolen?  Sasha, have you been spying on us,  spying on your cousin?  Don't flatter yourself.  I was over here, taking a Dahlia break,  staring at the so-called water,  when I happened to overhear your so-called plan.  Oh, snap.  Okay, fine, I'll do it. â­Do what?  I'll help you steal Dahlia's bounce house.  Why would we need your help?  Uh, first of all, ouch.  Second of all, you need a man on the inside.  I am that man.  Uh, Dahlia is your cousin; we can't trust you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, she's my cousin, but I wish she was-n.  Really?  Um, are you trying to look into my soul?  Already there, and it isn't pretty.  But you're not lying.  Not about this.  Okay, we can trust him.  So, listen, you can't just go  drag this thing back to your spot.  It's staked down, it needs a generator, it needs a fan,  and, oh, it's a 22-foot-tall castle.  Here's what I'm thinking,  You don't need the fan or the genny if you find a way  to seal the thing up, duct tape or something.  My wallet is made of duct tape; is that helpful?  No. (scoffs) Oh.  We're also gonna need a place  to put the bounce house where Dahlia can't get to it.  There, the lake. Hmm, interesting.  She's not gonna want to wade out there to get to you.  Yeah, it's only three feet deep,  but two of those feet are duck poop, I heard.  Yes, the lake, that's the spot.  But we're gonna have to do something about the adults.  Your dad, divorced, right?  Why do you say that?  He's here by himself,  he's wearing skinny jeans, retro eyeglasses,  and his teeth look like they're on day five  of a whitening strips program.  You're good.  I know. My aunt's divorced, too.  I'll send her this way.  Her New Year's resolution was to be less picky.  Let's put that to the test.  Gene, Tina, go search that ranger truck.  It looks like the bumper is held on with duct tape.  Maybe there's a roll in the back.  More stealing?  It's not stealing, it's borrowing.  Everything we're taking today is going back  to its rightful owners when we're done with it.  Plus, tape is everyone's.  You can't own tape.  Aw I think it's all tired out  from smashing into the window.  Don't know why the open door isn't as inviting.  Eh, I've walked into that window a couple of times.  Let's just corner it and grab it  and take it outside, right?  Okay, I'll do the grabbing.  I haven't held a living thing for a while.  It'll be good for me.  (cooing)  Ah!  Whoo!  He seems strangely okay with this.  What is this, reverse psychology?  Huh? What are you doing?  Teddy, Teddy, wait, wait, let me see him, let me see him.  Huh?  Aw, so docile.  Maybe we should take it to Bob.  We'll show him how harmless it is.  That sounds like a great idea!  Yeah, he'll see how cute it is and realize pigeons  are nothing to be afraid of, come on.  Yeah, that's how I got over my fear of babies.  Hi, Bobby. We're coming down.  Bob? You decent?  Yes, Teddy. Why wouldn't I be decent?  I-I don't know how you run your business.  Did you get the pigeon out?  Maybe. Before we answer that, come here.  What?  Hold out your close your eyes.  No. What are you what?  Hold out your hands. What are you doing, Lin?  Hold them out. Get them (Bob screams)  Okay, okay.  Why are you holding it?!  Why'd you bring it down here?!  Because it's harmless, Bobby.  Look, it's a baby.  Pigeons aren't harmless, Lin.  They steal French fries and they poop on everything  and they attack people's faces.  Just pet it, Bobby, you'll see.  Look, he likes it.  He's so soft. Get it away!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  (screams)  Great, now you got the pigeon  stuck deeper into the restaurant.  Okay, okay, you just got to let it exhaust itself.  Like Gene at dinner.  Oh, my God.  (imitates siren): Wee-yoo, wee-yoo.  Single dad checking out Aunt Caitlin alert.  What? Where?  The guy who wanted to share the bounce house?  Oh, I'm sure that was just  his pathetic excuse to come over here.  Eh.  Okay, you're out of his league,  but you've been away from the game.  Take a few swings, shag some ground balls.  I don't know.  Look, he may not be a sugar daddy,  but he's a daddy, sugar.  Hmm. How do I look?  Pretty divorced.  Go get him.  Hey, Rudy's dad.  What do you, uh, think of Dahlia's mom?  Uh, I'd let that dump me.  Sorry, you're kids; but that is my answer.  Well, she seems to be coming over here,  and she's looking at you.  Really? H-How do I look?  Like a man who's about to find romance in a public park.  Rudy, booger check?  Clear, except for Ol' Faithful.  He's never coming out.  That's right, son.  Great park, huh? Really great park.  I mean, if you like parks.  Yeah. Hey, remember when it was closed  because that guy kept flashing joggers?  Yeah. Yes, I do remember that.  Yeah, well, that wasn't me.  I don't Yeah. â­Good.  I mean, I don't know why I brought that up.  It's the only thing I can think of when I'm near a park.  We did it. The ranger had duct tape  in his truck, just like you said.  And two dead raccoons.  Being a ranger might not be the glamorous job we thought it was.  All right, time to move on to phase two of the plan.  Show me your taping faces.  (grunting) â­Gene, too big.  Tina, perfect. â­Thanks.  Time to bring out my lovely assistant, Miss Direction.  Okay, Dahlia's friends and Dahlia,  gather round, near me.  Focus all your attention here.  There's nothing else worth looking at.  Time to toast the birthday girl.  Oh, we're doing toasts?  Talk about the friendship bracelet company I'm starting,  Wristy Business. Hey, hey,  eyes up here, kids; older boy talking.  So, what is there to say about Dahlia  that she hasn't already said about herself?  She is without a doubt, my cousin.  Wait, we forgot the cake.  I'm gonna tell a funny,  loud story about Dahlia.  This is what she sounded like  when she started her friendship bracelet company:  ""Look at me.  ""I'm starting a friendship bracelet company.  I'm however many years old and I'm an en-entrepreneur.""  Hmm?  ""How impressive."" â­(gasps)  My bounce castle!  What? Oh, no. What's happening? Why you?  LOUISE: Go, go, go, go!  Push, Jeremy, damn it.  I'm pushing.  (grunting)  Everybody in!  (screaming)  Yes, we did it!  Wait, where's Gene? There!  (panting)  For cake's sake, wait for me!  (distorted yell)  This is Rudy's bounce house now, Dahlia!  You can have it back once we've bounced all the fun out of it!  (growling yell)  I'm floati, I'm bouncing, there's cake.  This is probably what it's like to be an astronaut!  I'm tall, I'm small, I'm tall, I'm small  Bouncing on land is for idiots.  BOTH: Ow. Ow. Ow.  Mom, go get it!  I'm not going in there.  Make your new boyfriend get it.  Eh, uh, boyfriend?  (chuckles) Okay.  Uh, Rudy, kids, gonna need you  to turn the castle around and come back to shore!  We can't steer it!  Well, I tried. It's up to the tides now.  Thanks.  You're very welcome. (chuckles)  So, uh, what do you think, Rudy?  What other kid has a bounce house  on a lake for his birthday?  It's nice, I guess,  but it's cutting into spoon puppet time,  and there are all those angry kids waiting for us.  Rudy, come on.  It's your birthday party, man. Enjoy it.  Here, jump on some cake; you'll like it.  (shudders)  Whoa, still going.  That's one tough pigeon.  (shudders) I wish I had gone to Rudy's birthday.  Is it weird if I just show up?  Bob, what is going on with you?  I've never seen you like this.  Well, we've never had a pigeon trapped  in the restaurant before, Lin.  We've lived a blessed life, and now that's over.  What's the matter? Did something happen to you?  Did a pigeon wrong you?  I don't think so. I mean, maybe.  But it would probably take years of therapy to  Oh, my God, I remember!  What? What? What happened? What?  I just remembered being in this house.  It was dark inside.  And for some reason I don't know why  I-I went upstairs. Then I heard this  strange fluttering behind a door,  and I stared at the doorknob  for what felt like three minutes.  But then I went in, and there was this big hole  in the ceiling.  You could see the sky through it.  And then I heard, I-I heard this terrible cooing.  I guess a bunch of pigeons  had flown in there, like, dozens.  And then and then they attacked me.  (screaming)  (birds cooing) Oh, God!  That didn't happen to you. Yes, it did.  No, it happened to Tippi Hedren in The Birds. What?  Bob, you're describing an exact scene  in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.  They call it ""shot for shot.""  Bob, you think you're Tippi Hedren, honey.  I don't think I'm Tippi Hedren.  I'm describing an event from my life.  Oh, my God, I'm Tippi Hedren.  Yeah, you wish.  I guess I must have seen that movie when I was young.  Oh, you poor thing. You poor dumb thing.  So, I guess, technically,  I shouldn't be afraid of pigeons.  There's so much other stuff to be afraid of.  Like getting stuck in one of those beds  that flips into the wall  or falling down the shower drain.  Getting choked by a guy.  What? â­Nothing.  Do you know what, I'm gonna go downstairs  and I'm gonna get that bird myself.  Really?  Yeah. I'm not afraid of pigeons anymore.  Yay! Go, Bobby!  Attaboy, Bob.  You're not afraid of a pigeon.  You're not afraid of a pigeon, Bob.  All right, here goes.  Are you, uh are you still down here?  (pigeon coos)  Oh, that was a really expensive bottle of olive oil.  Did you do that? Probably.  That was mean of you.  (screams)  Don't hurt me!  (pigeon coos)  Oh, what happened? You-you don't look so good.  Oh, you got him.  Ew, wait. What's all over it?  It's covered in olive oil.  Don't do it, Bob, don't do it!  You can't eat your fears!  I'm not gonna eat it, Teddy.  Then why'd you put olive oil on it?  I Di I didn't.  It did it to itself.  So, I guess, let's put it outside?  Okay, fly away. Go on.  You're free.  Go ahead, live your life.  Don't look back.  I don't think it can fly with all that oil on it.  Maybe it can just walk home, right?  It probably lives nearby.  We can't just leave a bird on the ground covered in oil.  When did we make that rule?  Why don't we just put some bread crumbs on him, huh?  Some cat's gonna come along and have a pigeon Parmesan.  (sighs) Fine, we'll call a shelter,  or whatever you do for oily pigeons.  Aw, we got a little pigeon patient.  (whooping) Jump, jump, jump, jump,  jump, jump, jump, jump, jump  Ramming speed!  What was that?  Row, row, row your boats!  We're under attack! It's a siege!  What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?  What are we gonna do?!  Jeremy, seal the gates.  Everyone else, bounce on this side.  We'll move this sucker with bounce power.  (grunting)  It's working.  I found the weak spot!  Rip it off.  No, no, no, no!  TINA: No! â­RUDY: Stop!  (air hissing) Oh, no!  Maybe it'll be fine without air in it.  Mm, yeah, maybe not.  We're sinking!  Everyone abandon ship!  But I'm with my dad this weekend,  and he doesn't have a dryer.  We don't have a choice!  (yelling)  (groaning)  Yes! You lose.  Yeah, you're right. She's all yours.  Oh.  Sasha?  I thought you were on our side.  (quietly): Gene, shush. He's a double agent.  He has to pretend to help them.  Oh. Sorry, Sasha.  I forgot you were a double agent.  Oh!  Oh, man.  Sasha? You bastard!  Okay, fine, yes, I helped them,  and I have zero regrets.  This is Ranger Matthew Dainko.  Come to shore immediately.  You're in big trouble!  Well, now I have one regret. â­LOUISE: Aw, crap.  So you took this party's bouncy house,  pushed it into the lake,  sank it, and stole my duct tape.  Who steals duct tape?!  Kids will be kids, right?  We're a bunch of little stinkers.  Yeah.  These are serious charges.  Oh, okay. So what happens now?  Shall we all exchange information, Caitlin?  No, no, thank you.  But, just to cover all â­Nope, nope.  Yeah, no, I'm good.  These kids are going to jail.  (gasping) Jail?  Well, ranger jail.  These cones are like bars, okay?  Don't cross them.  They're not like bars.  (growls)  But we get your point.  Can we crack a window?  It's smelling awfully rangery in here.  No! Now, you, it's paperwork time.  Oh, you are very intense.  Whew. I mean, little setback  got incarcerated but all in all,  pretty great birthday party, huh, Rudy-Rudes?  Huh, your face is looking a little red there, pal.  Squishing your fists pretty tight.  Does that mean you're happy?  (growls) ""Great birthday party""?!  Great?! This is the worst!  I didn't want to steal that bounce house,  but none of you would listen.  (inhales) All I wanted was a spoon puppet show.  I wrote a script and everything!  It's a comedy-drama  with two (gasps) strong female leads.  (crying): I was proud of it.  So  you didn't like your party.  (crying)  BOB: Right, uh-huh.  Oh, okay. â­What are what are they saying?  They have a pigeon lady.  She gives baths to dirty pigeons.  Aw.  Dirty pigeon lady.  So, does someone come here and get it?  Oh, we drive it to you.  But you're, like, 50 miles away.  It's just, I carried the pigeon outside,  and I-I took kind of a big step today,  so maybe you guys should take it from here.  Oh, okay, bye.  What is it? What are we doing?  What are we doing?  Okay, Bob, it's ready!  BOB: I'm in the bathroom, Lin!  What?  Why are you in the tub with the pigeon?  We were supposed to give it a bath.  Yeah, in the kitchen sink.  I wouldn't fit in the kitchen sink.  Not you, just the pigeon.  Oh, yeah.  You're right. I-I didn't think of that.  That, uh, yeah, that would've been the way to do it.  Yes.  But I did need a bath.  I was touching a pigeon all day.  Mm-hmm.  Look, Lin, I put bubbles on him.  He looks like a British barrister.  (British accent): Hello. Guilty as charged.  Well, I guess you're not scared of pigeons anymore.  I guess not.  Hey, this is how The Birds should have ended:  Tippi Hedren taking a bath with a bunch of birds.  Hey, Rudy, want to have a puppet show?  No, it's too late.  We don't have spoons,  but we still have the makings of a great cast here.  Such as this up-and-comer.  (Southern accent): I'm Pam Flit.  Get it? Pam Flit.  I'm just dying to play a strong female lead in a comedy-drama.  I could watch that pamphlet read the phone book.  Tina, you're stamps.  Stamps? I won't mail in this performance.  Gene, calculator.  You can count on me.  Type, type, type. ""Boobs.""  Harley, stress ball.  Oh, my God, I totally connect with this character!  Andy, Ollie, comb and that other side of the comb.  It's got perfect teeth.  Like you, Ollie.  Sasha, paper-clip.  Thank you.  Harley, I want the stress ball.  Trade. You're the paper-clip now.  Ooh, I love the paper-clip!  I am attached to this project. (chuckles)  I want the paper-clip back.  Just give me, give me it back. â­No, no!  Give me it back. Oh. â­No, no!  Hey, what about me?  Uh, Jeremy, you're your belt.  Oh, cool.  Is this happening?  Is this really happening?  Yep. You got your script handy?  Yeah. I mean, I was hoping we could workshop it a little bit.  Also, we should probably tweak it,  'cause it was written for spoons.  But you know what, we'll find it.  Let's just dive in.  Hey, what are you kids doing past the cones?  You're touching all my stuff!  All right, come on, kids. We're free to leave.  Oh, um, can we stay a little longer?  We're just about to do my script.  Yeah, my big monologue's coming up, I assume.  Oh, well, I, uh Okay, you can stay.  What? I can't just let you kids  stay in here as long as you want.  Then every kid would be in here all the time.  How about this? We'll give you a part.  Eh, I don't know. What's the part?  You can be, uh, well, the stapler.  The stapler?  It's a pretty meaty part.  All right, I'm in.  Thanks, Louise. This is the birthday I wanted.  You're welcome, Rudy.  All right, enough chitchat. We got a show to do!  Places, everyone.  ""We open on a tenement in Baltimore in 1981.""  LOUISE (Southern accent): Last time I saw you,  you were prom queen.  DAINKO (high-pitched): Oh, yeah? Well, now I'm a hooker.  ""She takes a long drag off her cigarette,  knowing it could be her last.""  (singers vocalizing)  Do the dirty pigeon, do the dirty pigeon   Do the dirty pigeon, do the dirty pigeon   Do the dirty pigeon, do the dirty pigeon   Do the dirty pigeon, do the dirty pigeon   (pigeon cooing)  BOB (British accent): Hello. Guilty as charged.  Do the dirty pigeon, do the dirty pigeon   Do the dirty pigeon, do the dirty pigeon   Do the dirty pigeon"
"I'm bored.  Somebody do something interesting.  Well, wait till you see our new handshake.  Up top, time to mop.  And Bop!  It isn't ready yet.  Yeah, it is pretty slow today.  You guys want to take the day off, maybe?  Go have some fun  How'd you get to the door so fast?  Adios! Later! Bye!  I just said it.  Be back in time to help clean up after closing.  Aw, if you two would move a little faster,  we wouldn't have heard that.  But you did and now you got to help.  Hey!  These are all stained.  I told the kids not to store the napkins under the sink.  They're all ruined.  On the plus side,  you made three in a row.  I know. Watch this.  Sky hook! Ah!  So what do you say normal day off stuff?  Or we could try something new?  Hitch hike to Myrtle Beach?  Meet all the Myrtles? No, no, no, no.  Let's stick with the tried and true.  We look for loose change under the pier,  use that to buy some Fortune Fudge,  then ride the Zany Plane inverted  throw up, and do it all over again?  You really like getting your inverted on, huh?  I'm developing a taste for it.  We've already inverted ourselves twice this month.  When is enough enough?!  When we're out of throw up? Yes.  Found another quarter!  Two dimes and six pennies for me!  I always get the worst section!  Nothing but bottle caps and Band-Aids!  - No way. - Yes way.  A two-butted goat? Impossible.  I swear I saw it two butts.  On a farm, right past that cornfield on Route 6.  Just stop trying to impress me.  We're already friends.  Two-butted goat!  Two-butted goat!!!  Watch this one, Lin.  Off the counter and swish!  Well not swish, but  Ah, good one.  You weren't even looking.  You try. It's fun.  Take a few shots. Nah.  Come on, the restaurant is empty.  Hey, we could play Horse.  I don't know.  Maybe if we don't keep score.  Well, you can't play Horse without keeping score.  You have to.  It's just we can get  a little competitive.  You get a little in your head.  I get a little in your face.  We won't get like that this time, I promise.  Okay, I mean, it's not really fair.  I was fourth-grade hoop-shoot champion.  And you weren't, so  Okay, take it easy.  Boosh! All right.  Now I have to make the same shot.  And I miss.  Huh, all right, so I get an ""H.""  Yeah you do.  Which is good and fine.  And this is fun.  I'm having fun.  Not at all in my head.  Spin around clockwise and then yell out  your favorite Meryl Streep movie It's Complicated!  Yeah!  In your face!  I mean, not in your face.  Sportsmanship.  You're seriously telling me  you don't want to go and see a two-butted goat.  That cornfield on Route 6 is really far away.  Also, there's no such thing as a two-butted goat, Gene.  Yeah, call me when there's a two-butted boy.  Or just tell me, since we live at the same place.  We never do anything I want to do!  No, we did that one time.  We went to the hospital when you got a concussion.  Remember? No!  Plus, we have a great day planned.  Now let's read our fortunes.  ""Stay away from teenage skunks,  they have P-U-berty."" Ha-ha! Na  ""If 'ifs' and 'buts' were candies and nuts,  we'd all be eating our words.""  Butts! It's a sign!  ""The one destined to be your true love  will be revealed at the end of a journey.""  Wow. Intense.  Oh, you got a piece from the old batch.  Before they started making the fortunes hilarious.  Yeah, it's old.  Huh, is the ceiling fan on a little higher?  It's blustery.  Ceiling fan.  The only problem is you're playing against  the fourth-grade hoop-shoot champ!  It's like the fifth time you've mentioned that.  Teddy, come in!  Can, uh, can I get you a burger?  Nah, maybe just a coffee.  And some fries.  And a burger. And a beer.  What's going on here? What are we doing?  Oh, me and Bob are playing Horse.  He's about to lose.  Oh, you guys are competing? Uh-oh.  Well, we'll have to finish later, anyway.  Uh, 'cause I have to go make your food, so  Oh, no, no, no. I'll wait.  I want to see what happens.  Um okay.  This will be either fun or terrible.  Bend the back, over the rack!  Wow! What's all this?  They're playing horse.  This is it, Bob.  Game's on the line.  Air ball! I win!  Is the sun coming in at a weird angle or something?  Eh no.  Uh, you know, I think  I'm just too strong.  I feel like I need, like,  uh, something heavier.  Still missed.  Well, now, all right, hold on.  I H-How about a new game?!  This game, uh, is a little more challenging.  I-It's, uh, like napkin darts.  What the hell is napkin darts?  Yes! We'll call it Narts!  You call where you want to throw it.  Let's say, uh, that stool.  And your opponent has to make the same shot  or they get a letter.  But not to spell ""horse,"" to spell ""Narts.""  Seems like he's just ripping off Horse.  I don't know if I'm gonna be any good at this.  I'm a hoop-shoot champ. This is different.  Huh, not that different.  I got next!  Ah, I wish I had shorts on.  Bob, can I borrow some shorts?  Mmm, no.  Hmm, the planes are looking  extra zany today.  How many butts does a Zany Plane have?  None! This goat has two!  Trust me, Gene.  When we're flying on this thing inverted,  defying the laws of gravity  and spitting in the face of science,  you'll forget all about the two-butted goat.  Two-butted goat? Say butt, say what?  Oh, hey guys.  Hi, Jimmy Jr., Zeke.  And Jocelyn and Tammy?  I guess I didn't get the invitation  to the ""Eighth Graders Go to the Wharf Day""?  That's not what this is. We're just hanging out.  Oh, phew. Yeah, don't get your boobs in a bunch.  We didn't even come together.  It was just me and Zeke.  And then they started following us.  You wish. Where are you going next?  Hey, guys.  I followed Tammy and Jocelyn here.  Hi, Darryl. Hey.  Hi, guys.  Rudy, when'd you get here?  I've been here the whole time.  Everyone keeps cutting in front of me.  Yeah, it's too crowded here.  Zeke, let's go on that ride over there.  Ba-ba-ba, ho-ho!  I want to hear about this two-butted goat!  Spill it!  I was under the pier and I heard  these guys talking about a two-butted goat  on a farm out by the cornfield on Route 6.  And I'm the only one who wants to go see it!  Well, count me in, Gene-o-sabe.  Oh, come on, that can't be real. You think?  If a cow's got four stomachs,  why can't a goat have two butts?  Technically a cow just has one stomach,  with four separate chambers.  But there was a two-faced cat in England,  so a two-butted goat seems possible.  All cats are two-faced.  Guys, the Zany Plane is super fun.  And we're in line for it.  Oh, and it's real.  I want to go see the two-butted goat!  Me, too!  Really, Zeke? I mean, um  Yeah, me three. I'll go.  Sounds good.  Maybe it's my destiny  to go on this journey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  We could spend our whole day  going to look for this thing,  and it might not even exist!  She's right.  There's no guarantee it's real.  But it might be.  So I ask you  would you rather have a lifetime of regret,  or an afternoon of mild disappointment?  That is deep.  I'll go if you go. Oh, my God!  I was just about to say the same thing.  I really was! Oh, my God!  Should we go? Should we go? Should we go? Let's go!  Let's go!  I am in!  No, back out.  Nope, back in. I'm okay.  Fine, I'll go.  And when we get there and there's no goat,  Gene, you have to do all the cleanup  when we get back to the restaurant.  What if there is a two-butted goat?  Then I'll do all the clean up. Deal!  Either way, I don't have to clean up.  Sounds great.  Follow me to the two-butted goat!  Does anyone know where Route 6 is?  Not at all. Nope. No!  I don't know any of the roads.  Then follow me to the gas station  to get a map and some beef jerky  and use the bathroom!  Everyone's doing what I want to do  and it feels great, doesn't it Darryl? Rudy?  Pretty good.  Wrong day to experiment  with dress shoes and no socks.  Just so you know, Gene, if we get lost  you still have to do all the cleanup.  Worth it!  Looks like we just stay on this road  and it takes us to Route 6.  And then there's lots of dotted lines  and a big green patch that must be Iowa.  Those dotted lines are probably fire roads.  And it looks like this one might be a shortcut.  If the road's on fire, we're not going on it. Yeah.  Just kidding! We'll do what everyone else does.  Let's take the shortcut and get there shorter!  I don't know they're dotted lines for a reason.  We don't know what's in-between those dots.  Let's find out! We got some dots to connect!  I'm just gonna say what everyone's thinking.  Does two butts mean three cheeks or four cheeks or what?  More importantly, are we talking about separate anuses?  Does that mean it can fart in harmony?  Fart-mony!  I never even thought of that.  This is bigger than I imagined.  It's the biggest thing ever!  And it's not real.  Why are you being so negative?  Well, for one, we should all be riding the Zany Plane.  And two, if a two-butted goat does exist,  don't you think it'd probably have,  like, it's own show on TLC?  And three, overhearing teenagers at the pier  might not be the best way to get information.  Mmm, I would agree to disagree, because that's actually  how I learned that green scrunchies are out.  What? Oh, my God you're being paranoid.  I told you that I liked it. I know.  I believe it exists.  The world is full of mystery and magic!  Yeah, if nature can make all the different colors  of autumn leaves, why not a two-butted goat?  Damn straight!  I'm a bit of a leaf-peeper.  Whoa, Rudy has a sensitive side.  Could he be my destiny?  In 20 years, the age difference won't matter.  I never noticed before,  but you look like my mother when she's tired.  Probably not my destiny.  Okay.  Nice and easy.  You can do this.  If you miss, you lose.  You lose a game that you invented.  Sometime today, Bob.  - Damn it! - I beat Bob at Narts!  Rematch! I'm up.  Oh, right. Well, uh,  maybe we should do a-a tournament.  Uh, Mort probably wants in right, Mort?  Yeah, I'm feeling Narty.  God, Mort! You ruin everything.  Sorry, I'm sorry.  Great, I'll draw it up.  Write my name up there as ""Win-da.""  No. Yes!  Two, two  Two-butted goat!  Our voices sound good together!  No they don't. Like Hall and Goats.  Hey, I think that's the fire road!  Yeah!  Two, two, two-butted goat  Why are you dragging your wagon, Jimmy Jr.?  Yeah, aren't you excited?  It's this was supposed to be a day with just me and Zeke.  Look at them.  It's ""two-butted goat this,""  and ""our voices sound good together that,""  and ""there's the fire road this.""  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Are you jealous of Gene?  What?! Why-why would I be jealous  of Mr. ""Perfect-hears-about  every-two-butted-goat in-the-world""?  Oh, my God, you're so Gene jelly!  You're a Gene jelly donut!  No I'm not!  Fine, I am.  Aw, okay.  So to get Zeke back, you have to remind him  how fun you are to hang out with.  Yeah. Yeah.  Wait, like how?  Find a five-butted goat.  Yeah.  I think it's an electric fence.  Maybe to keep deer out of the corn?  Don't touch it.  It's not an electric fence.  It's just humming.  Don't all fences do that?  Rudy, touch it.  No thank you.  We can do this just carefully  limbo through the wires and  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa.  It didn't even hurt.  Hey, I'm gonna pass the zap.  Who wants some?  Uh, I'll take a zap, Zeke!  Gotcha!  It tickles and it hurts  and I pooped a little, but it went back up!  That's what I'm talking about!  He gets it!  Oh, man!  Electricity was literally  running between them.  No, that was beautiful.  I'm so happy to hear Shut up!  Here's how you go through  with the least amount of contact.  I got it! Nope!  Seizing up! Seizing up!  Maybe my destiny is Zeke.  So brave.  Can you see my bones? Are they glowing?  But not that bright.  We could just  go through this gate.  Maybe it's Darryl.  So smart.  The gate's too heavy!  Um, let's keep looking.  Anyone can walk through a gate!  You're missing out!  All right, door handle.  All right! Okay, Teddy.  This is it. Last shot.  You have to make this or Linda wins.  I got this.  Aah!  Thanks a lot, Bob!  What? What did I do?  You breathe too hard!  I breathe too hard?  That's you!  Hey, calm down, Teddy.  Don't you touch me!  Teddy!  Don't you see what's happening?  She's turning us against each other!  You are!  Oh, I am not.  Teddy says that every day.  You witch! Okay!  So, Mort's up next.  Good luck, Mort.  Maybe I'm not the guy  Go, Mort! Uh  You're playing, Mort. We're gonna keep playing  until somebody beats her.  I don't know.  I've never been good with napkins  or toilet paper Gross.  That was a pretty lame cornfield, Gene.  No mazes, no scarecrows  No children of it.  Pretty good-looking corn, though.  And now we get to cross a river on a dead tree.  Like in the movies!  That's fun.  I like movies.  Hold on, everyone.  I think that's poison ivy.  Uh-oh. Great, first Gene's idea  gives Zeke a twitch he didn't used to have.  It'll go away.  And now we're all gonna be itchy.  I say we head back.  Yeah, I heard poison ivy  is really bad for your skin.  What? No  I already have eczema.  I don't even want to know  what poison ivy will do to it.  Okay, listen.  If we keep going, it may be  a risk to our smooth, silky skin,  but I say it's still worth it!  Because we're talking about a two-butted goat!  Now, who will stand with me?!  I'm actually done. No way. Sorry, yeah.  Not me, buddy. I can't.  I don't want to risk my silky skin.  Yeah, we're out, right Zeke?  No way, J-Ju!  If it's out there, we have to try!  I'm with you, Gene!  Psst, go to him.  Go! Go!  Fine, I'm coming.  I'm in, too. Sorry, feet.  Oh, I'm going.  I want to see your face  when you see my face laughing in your face  when you don't see a two-butted goat.  And I have to see what destiny awaits  at the end of this journey.  Settle down, Robert Frost.  You guys won't regret sticking with me.  Darryl, Tammy, Jocelyn,  you sure you don't want to keep going?  Oh, they're gone.  Well the good news is  the poison ivy is easy to step over.  Even with these regular-sized legs.  Yeah! It's almost fun to step over.  Nuts.  Man, that poison ivy is thick.  I knew I was gonna get a rash today somehow.  So, what do we do now, Gene?  Well, I think if we could hop  from rock to rock, we could stay above it.  God closes a door, Gene notices a series of rocks.  Let's do it!  You have to remind him how fun you are to hang out with.  Yeah.  Hey, Zeke! Check this out!  I'm David Lee Roth-in' it! What?  Panama!  Whoa! Didn't they have  a song called ""Jump""?  Yeah, so what?  Why not say that when you jump?  I just I didn't think of it.  Whatever. You try it, Gene!  Nah, I'm more of a Sammy Hagar.  Hagar-in' it!  That's fun!  Hagar-in' it to destiny.  Aah!  I'm okay.  Come on, let's go, Mort. Come on.  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Are you kidding me?  Are you serious?!  Should I close my eyes?  Would that help?  I'm starting to feel bad for you guys.  And under the leg  to the bell above the door, aah!  Oh, boy. What's going on in here?  Napkin darts?  Yeah, we call it Narts.  Cool, I like fun words.  I got next. Who's winning?  Linda. No one can beat her.  She's like an evil Narts robot.  She is the hoop-shoot champ.  You told Mike you were  the fourth-grade hoop-shoot champ?  No, I read about it. You did?!  No, she told me. Oh, right.  Anyway, I was a pitcher in junior college, so, uh  Bring it, mailman!  You'll-you'll be up after Mort.  Which is Mort, throw it.  Right now. Yep.  Mike's up. Beat her, Mike,  and you get a free burger.  But if I win, I get free mail. Go!  Uh-oh, no more rocks.  And a lot more poison ivy. Look!  That's got to be the farm!  But we can't get to it without walking through poison ivy.  Maybe we could swing across on a vine.  No.  Well, Gene, we tried your idea  and it was a gigantic failure.  So, time to head back?  No! Only one of us  has to get poison ivy for us all to see the two-butted goat.  What do you mean ""only one of us""?  One person gets it by carrying the rest of us across.  Oh. Oh, wow.  And since this whole thing was my idea,  I think that person should be me?  I'm all choking up over here.  This guy's my hero.  Come on, boy!  Come on, boy!  What I miss?  It's still NAR to NAR.  She'll slip up soon enough.  Mike is our best hope.  Flying burgers picture.  - Yes! - Nice one!  Ha!  Damn!  Return to sender, baby!  Get it mail?  So tired.  Legs itch so much!  Look at him sacrificing himself,  so that we might live  to see a two-butted goat.  Like a little, rashy Bruce Willis in Armageddon.  I can't believe we're about to see it!  Damn, I thought that was gone.  It's all gonna be worth it!  We're almost there.  Oh, my God, please let there be a two-butted goat!  Please let there be a two-butted goat!  What, Gene? Nothing!  We're almost at the end of our journey.  My destiny is going to be revealed.  If it's a farmer,  please let him be a teen farmer.  What, Tina?  I said please let him be a teen farmer!  Ta-da!  A no-butted nothing!  Wait! Look!  Show us your butt!  Here, goaty goaty goat! Here, goaty goaty.  Come on. Come on, little fella!  Come on. Come on out, buddy, come on.  Come out here so we can see your butt! Nothing weird!  I just can't take it anymore!  Can you see it, Gene?  Go!  Yes! It's  It's  it's a one-butted goat!  Oh.  Ha! Gah!  I failed you all!  Yeah, you did.  I really believed.  I hoped and I hoped and then nope.  I won the bet, but I kind of wish I hadn't.  I'm sorry, Gene.  You deserved to see that goat.  No, I didn't!  There is no mystery!  There is no magic in this world.  I don't believe it.  Oh, my God Gene!  Everything just has one butt.  Nothing is special. Gene, look!  It's time for me to grow up, I guess.  Gene, Gene, Gene! Turn around!  What?!  You're real?  You're real!  Okay!  It's NART to NART.  This could be the final shot, Mike.  You scared?  Maybe if I make a really big fart sound,  she'll miss. I doubt it.  But if we both make one at the same time,  it might be loud enough.  Let's do it.  Okay, Mike, I call  the blade of the ceiling fan.  Which blade?  There's five of them.  The one with the ketchup on it.  How do you get ketchup on a ceiling fan?  Ready, Bob?  Make it a good one.  On three.  One  Two  Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?  Lin  Da  Three!  Where were you?!  Sorry, Teddy, I can't do it.  That's my wife.  And  got it!  Linda, yes! Great shot!  Wait, you're cheering for me?  Uh-huh.  And  Linda gets free mail. Hooray!  All right!  Yes! Linda wins!  Here you go, Linda. It's on me.  Okay, that's it. Tournament's over.  Linda is the champion! Ha!  Lin, sorry if I got a little bit  exactly the way you said I'd be.  It's okay it must be annoying how good I am.  It is. One more time?  Just for fun?  Okay, just for fun.  But we'll keep score.  You're going down!  I mean, sportsmanship.  It's magnificent.  Two tails and two anuses.  Just like Noah's Ark.  Poor Darryl and Tammy and Jocelyn.  They missed out.  They'll never know.  In hindsight, one of us should've brought a camera.  I'm sorry I doubted you, Gene.  Me, too.  I could stay here and stare at this  beautiful bastard's butts forever.  Hey, stay away from my goat! Get off my land!  He's not a teen.  I'm kidding!  Come on, that's just a bit I do  ""The mean, old farmer.""  Go ahead, you can pet little Double Butt.  We can? Sure!  Fart-mony!  Oh, it stinks.  Twice as much.  Hey, Tina, there's  something I have to tell you.  Oh, my God, is this it?  Is he the one I'm truly destined to be with?  Yes, Jimmy Jr.?  You're standing in goat poop.  I'm standing in goat poop and?  That's it.  I would just step out of it.  I don't get it! We went on a big journey,  the two-butted goat was there,  but the one destined to be  my true love wasn't revealed.  Tina, listen carefully.  Life is a journey.  Uh-huh? That's all I got.  I don't have advice. I'm nine.  No, I see what you're saying.  Well, I'm not saying anything.  Maybe my two-butted goat is still out there.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  You really did it, Gene.  You changed our lives.  Yeah, come here, Gene Victory wrestle!  Come on! Come on!  No! I don't want to wrestle!  My legs are itchy and my back hurts from carrying you guys!  I-I'll wrestle you, Zeke.  That's right!  That's my Wrestle Rascal!  That's my Wrestle Rascal!  Get over here! Come on!  I am!  Assume the position, big boy!  Ow, ow, Zeke, ow!  I'm gonna flip you over.  Flippin' you over.  Ow, my head!  Sorry, sorry, sorry!  It was a perfect day, Gene.  Yeah, I don't even care that I lost the bet.  It was worth it to see a two-butted goat.  You're welcome.  Besides, how dirty can the restaurant be?  What the freak happened in here?!  Two, two, two-butted goat  Two, two, two-butted goat"
"1  LINDA: Who wants  Mommy's Famous Pancakes with a chocolate chip  happy face on 'em? I don't get why they're so happy.  They're about to be eaten. And then worse.  I kind of want to slap the smile off him.  Aw. When you guys were little, you loved Mr. Flapjack.  Now you're just a bunch of pancake poopers.  (phone buzzes) Dad, get it! It could be the president  of breakfast calling to congratulate us.  Hello?  Bob, it's me, Critter.  Oh, hey, Critter. Hey, Critter! Hi, Critter.  Hey! Hi, Critter! So, how are you?  Oh, can't complain, except for the fact that I'm in jail.  You're in jail? Critter got pinched.  What happened?  Uh, it's silly, really.  I got stopped for a broken taillight,  and it turns out I owed $9,000 in unpaid parking tickets.  Wow, that's a lot of unpaid parking tickets.  Bob, I'm in an outlaw motorcycle club.  We don't pay parking tickets.  In fact, we make kind of a whole big thing  about throwing 'em out.    (whooping)  Yeah! Yeah! Mmm!  But I got to pay off this fine and get out of jail.  That's where you come in.  W-Wait, wait. You want me to help you get out of jail?  Jailbreak! Tell him we're in.  I'll put on a dress and distract the guard!  Yoo-hoo! Just practicing.  Listen, Bob, I need you to sell my bike for me  so I can pay off this fine and get out of here.  Can't you call Mudflap?  No, Mudflap's on a wilderness retreat  called ""Women of the Wild.""  They teach you how to survive in the woods  which dirt's edible, how to confuse a bear, stuff like that.  Oh. Who's watching your baby?  Sidecar's with the sitter.  Look, I got a buyer lined up.  He'll give you ten grand for it. That'll cover my fine.  Oh, I-I can't really help you sell a motorcycle  that's probably stolen, I'm assuming.  GENE: Narc! Bob, the bike's not stolen.  It's made from stolen parts.  Once you put them all together, it's a brand-new bike. Hmm.  Here's what you got to do.  Go to my apartment, get my bike, go to the buyer.  Another outlaw biker guy?  No, no, no, no, an investment banker guy named Kenny.  He's super straight-laced, kind of a big nerd,  but he thinks this biker stuff will make him cool.  So when you drop off the bike, make him feel cool.  He'll give you the money, you pay my fine,  I get out of jail, we high five.  Critter, I really wish we could help, but (phone beeping)  Bob, my phone time's up. I need a yes or no answer here.  No? Damn it! I don't know why I gave you that option.  LOUISE: So, let me get this straight.  Critter asked you for help, and you told him to rot in jail?  Louise, that's not what happened exactly.  I just hope when we call you from jail,  you'll help us out. Yeah.  Of course we will!  And bring us a cake with a smaller cake smuggled inside it!  So, we could stay here  at our boring restaurant all day,  or we could help an outlaw biker sell his motorcycle.  This is a no-brainer!  No. Come on!  We never do fun activities together!  This family is falling apart!  We're all just strangers under the same roof.  Guys, selling a probably stolen bike  isn't a fun family activity.  Going to the zoo is a fun family activity.  Aw, I love the zoo.  So many animals.  Yeah, yeah. (phone buzzing)  I don't know this number.  That's exciting. Hello?  Bob, it's me again. I'm talking on a butt phone.  What's a butt phone?  Well, it's a cell phone  somebody smuggled in here in an orifice of his body.  Oh, okay. Come on, I'm desperate here.  You're the only one I can ask for help.  Why don't you just ask the One Eyed Snakes?  The biker gang that you're the leader of?  (muffled): I'm kind of on a break from the One Eyed Snakes.  What? I can't understand you.  (muffled): I'm on a break from the One Eyed Snakes.  I still can't make out what you're saying.  I'm on a break from the One Eyed Snakes! MAN: Hey.  Oh. Really? You left the One Eyed Snakes? What?!  Great. Now everybody in jail knows.  I'm probably gonna get picked last  for riots and stuff like that.  What-what happened? I'm a dad now.  I-I can't go out till 6:00 in the morning  and then get up at 6:00 in the morning.  I get it.

You take a bottle of wine,  and you put it in a shoe.  Uh-huh  Right?  Oh that's it?  Yeah! Pretty good, right?  Yeah. Now, what will a pair  of these honeys set my client back?  Oh, those?  Uh, they're $155.  (coughs) Wow! Okay.  Can you show us something in the, uh ten dollar range?  Ten dollars?  Uh, okay.  Do you know how much material  goes into a size 14 woman's shoe?  How much engineering?  This heel will hold up to 350 pounds of woman.  Walking working  dancing living.  In fact, my good friend,  the incredible Miss Taint Behavin'  does five shows a weekend in these exact shoes.  So even if there was a ten dollar size 14 woman's shoe,  I wouldn't sell it.  Lives are at stake!  How old do you have to be to work here?  Twenty-seven.  LINDA: Oh, well,  what's the use of having dreams  if they can't be crushed?  Hold on, Mom.  Maybe we don't need to buy those shoes right now.  What? Then all we'd have is wine  and what good is that?  I can't believe I just said that.  We pitch our idea to investors.  What investors? Where do we find investors?  Right there.  (laughing)  Oh, hello, Belchers!  Just having one of our money fights.  (laughing): Get away!  (Fischoeder and Felix laughing) See what I mean, Mom?  (gasps) FELIX: I got you!  No, no, what're you talking

birthday.  There will be an all school assembly,  where the Hormone-iums will perform, Mona Nucleosis,  a show about the dangers of mono,  but it's not about my birthday, I don't think.  Let's see the clip.  No, no, kissing   Kissing is the worst   If you kiss me   You'll end up in a hearse.   Wow, downer.  Don't kiss Tina, I guess.  And now weather.  Jocelyn?  Whoa, Tina!  You're like the cover girl of No Kissing magazine.  No, no, no!  I do like kissing!  Didn't seem like it. No, I, I  (gasping)  (nervous grunting)  (Tina nervous grunting)  Oh, no!  (nervous grunts) Tina, what are you doing?  You can't put these up!  No one will ever want to kiss me again!  (Tina nervous grunting)  Stop it, Tina, stop it.  I quit, I quit, I'm quitting the show.  I quit! You can't quit.  You're Mona Nucleosis!  And we're gonna be on the main stage!  Do you know how long  I've been trying to get the principal to let  the Hormone-iums perform on that stage?!  And no one is going to think you really hate kissing.  Do people think Tony Danza is really The Boss?  I do, I mean, he's at least a boss.  (groaning)  Oh, Tina, you always wanted to be a soloist,  and now you will be and it doesn't have to stop there.  I mean, this could be  just the beginning of solos for you.  Really? Yes.  Hey, what if I made you  the female Hormone-iums soloist permanently?  Whoa, that's been my dream for two years.  And now it's all coming true.  So, do we have a deal?  (nervous groaning)  Okay. Great.  Now, Tina, no more freaking out.  Just press your feelings  into a tight little diamond and sparkle.  (groans)  Oh hey, Tina.  Quick thing about my birthday party.  Sorry, but I have to uninvite you.  What?! Yeah.  It's a reverse-vitation.  You have a minus one to this party.  Wait, why?  Because Tammy said.  You're like a kiss narc now. Hello!  How can we trust Miss No Kissing not to  (whispering): rat out a kissing party?  I don't really hate kissing.  I'm just playing a part.  Okay, but I'm playing a part where  I uninvite you to my party,  and I'm really good at it.  You are. You're really believable.  I know.  I'm like so good at this role.  (nervous groaning)  Permanent soloist.  Permanent soloist.  Permanent soloist.  Permanent soloist.  Permanent soloist!  Oh, good, you're here.  I got Gretchen to loan me  the Wine Shoe back for 24 hours.  We got to work on our pitch for the Fischoeders.  They're coming tomorrow afternoon.  Okay, Gene, write these down.  All right.  Um, Mer-loafers. Mm-hmm.  Sauvingnon Blahniks.  Mom, listen to me.  We need to sell Wine Shoe  as a journey, not a product.  We got to tell them a story and if that fails,  you have to cry.  Huh, all right, okay.  Uh, the story is  Wine Shoes  go together  like wine  Good so far.  Y sometimes, you just need  a little wine in your shoe  to get through Wait, you could do, uh,  Cinderella. Yes!  Like, oh, where does this shoe fit?  On a bottle of wine.  The one you've been waiting for your whole life.  Finally, you found your Prince Charming,  and it's a bottle of wine.  Oh, my God, Bobby, I'm transported.  Dad, you son of a bitch.  Let's do this. (whoops)  I thought kissing would be heaven   So I kissed a boy   Or seven   Mononucleosis has got you   On your knees   Worse than halitosis   It's a kissing disease   All your bad decisions   Have kicked you in your butt   If only I'd kept my   Lips   Shut   We're ready.  (upbeat music from Gene's keyboard)  Oh, I have the most beautiful bottle of wine  in all the land but alas, I have no place  to display it.  Hark.  Ooh, I wasn't expecting that.  Excuse me, fair maiden,  but I couldn't help but notice  that you may have dropped this shoe at my castle.  I did?  I am going from home to home  seeing what this shoe could fit on.  Oh, it looks too big for me, alas.  But wait!  What if the shoe fits on the wine?  (all gasp)  We'll fund your play.  I have a few notes,  but I think it would be great if you  Oh, no, no, no.  Uh, we're not selling the play,  we're selling this.  (keyboard plays fanfare)  Gentleman, today we are offering you a 50% stake  in our company, Wine Shoe,  for the low price of $1,000.  Never more will your wine look lame,  sitting there on the counter like an idiot.  Pinot gross-i-o!  Give your wine that wow factor with Wine Shoe.  Ah!  So you did not call me  over here to give me rent money?  Okay, so you're out.  Felix, what do you say?  Well, I have had some businesses  like this in the past.  I founded Light-Tights,  the tights with the light-up fannies. I have those.  I'm afraid, however, that Wine Shoe  Wha-wha-what?  just doesn't speak to me.  What?! Yeah, sorry, Linda,  but it's a no.  Oh, come on Mom!  (whining)  What? (whispering): Cry.  Oh, oh, right, right, right.  (crying) Look what you did to my mom.  (Linda wailing) Should we sneak out?  Yes.  Here we go, sneaking out.  BOTH: Sneak  sneak, sneak, sneak.  Ugh. Aw, nuts!  LINDA: I don't know what went wrong.  I thought I could sell anything.  I really thought I'd get my dream.  Dreams are dumb! They ruin your life!  What? Tell me about it!  I'll never be the Royal Baby.  Can I finish my dinner in my room?  Uh, sure.  (groaning)  (Linda sighs)  I guess I'll go talk to her.  No, Lin, you're still sad about your shoes.  I'll-I'll go.  All right.  (crying)  Uh, Tina, can, uh, can we talk?  Still got that spaghetti, huh?  Yeah.  That's good.  We'll wash the sheets later.  Okay. Look  you are obviously upset.  I-is is it about your puberty show?  Kinda.  You want to tell me about it?  Okay, but if I tell you  then I'm telling you another kid's secret.  Do you swear not to tell?  I think so as long as it's not  murder.  It's not. Good.  Well, there was gonna be  45 minutes of spin the bottle  at Jocelyn's party  Okay  but I got uninvited  because now I'm Mona Nucleosis,  the face of anti-kissing!  Oh, uh, that sounds bad, yeah.  And Mr. Frond told me I could be the new permanent soloist,  but if I do the show tomorrow  no one will ever want to kiss me ever again.  Okay, first of all, people will want  to kiss you again, Tina.  Really? Yup. Boys?  Yup.  Huh. What do they look like?  I-it's a hypothetical, it's  Tan?  Yes, they're tan boys.  But not like that orange-y self-tan.  Nope. Anyway, I know puberty positivity  is important to you and that's good but  if doing this play is making you say  something you don't believe in, then maybe,  you shouldn't do it.  Even if I said I would?  Yeah, because whether you kiss anyone or not,  you're in charge of your own mouth.  Who you kiss with it and what you say with it.  And, Tina?  Are you gonna say you  have to tell on Jocelyn's party?  No, I was going to ask you if  you wanted me to get you a handful of ice cream.  (students chattering quietly)  FROND: All right,  places, everyone.  I'll see you on the other side.  (to self): It's my mouth. It's my mouth.  It's my mouth.  Okay, everybody, let's do this thing.  Just be advised I've made some changes to the end of the show,  try to keep up. There's our cue, let's go.  Oh, no! I am afraid this student, Mona, is dying.  Dying from mononucleosis.  Nurse, I need you to write something down.  Yes, Doctor?  (mouthing) DARRYL: Kissing is really dangerous.  Well   Wait, Doctor!  Um, uh, yes, Mona?  I feel better. Oh. Hey!  Because mono would really only cause death  in someone very old, very young,  or someone who had a compromised  immune system. I looked it up.  Okay  (whispering): Tina, if you don't stick to the script, the only thing  you'll be kissing is permanent soloist good-bye.  I've made up my mind, Mr. Frond.  Kissing isn't dangerous, but misinformation is.  Well   Wait!  Darryl, do you have mono?  Uh, no.  (smooches) Whoa! (audience gasping)  There, see?  Nobody died and nobody's going to die.  I mean, we all will, eventually,  but probably not today and probably not from mono.  Kissing is one of the great parts of life, like dancing.  Yeah!  Or rainy days.  Or those croissants  Meryl Streep made in that movie.  We don't have to not kiss.  We just have to smart kiss  and now, I am going to kiss everyone in this row  Do what?!  Tina, no! No, no, Tina! Well   I don't know much about huggin' and a-kissin'   You were good in that play, Tina.  Thanks.  And if you want, you can come to my party.  You know, I'll probably have to weigh my options.  Okay, I'm in.  LINDA: Unbelievable!  Bob, look at this.  That's your Wine Shoe.  Some company stole my idea!  Booze Shoes.  Our best selling novelty wine holder  for five years running.  Oh.  Huh, they stole your idea before you had it.  Or another way of saying that  is you stole it from them.  I didn't.  I thought of it.  Well, then look on the bright side, Lin,  you came up with an idea  that people clearly want to buy.  Yeah, you're right.  (gasps) I just got another idea.  Talk to me.  Candle Sandals. You take a sandal.  You cut a hole in it, you put a candle in it.  That rhymes.  Done, million dollars, done.  It's genius.  Et voila.  Gene, go online and order a thousand sandals  and a thousand candles.  On it. No.  Oh, excuse me,  Jennifer Love Gorgeous.  Are you lost?  The set of whatever movie  you're working on is down the street.  Mom, it's me, Tina.  (gasps) Wha-what?  I'm just dressed up because I'm going  to Jocelyn's birthday party.  Just a regular old birthday party, nothing special.  Right, Dad?  Right, Tina.  Have fun at your regular birthday party.  Okay, bye.  What was that about?  They're gonna play spin the bottle.  Oh. Oh!  Aww. What's spin the bottle?  Can we play? Yeah.  That would be weird.    Mm-hmm checking the wind.  Floor is tilted one degree  Oh, my God, Tina, go!  My mom's gonna be back in 37 minutes.  Okay.  Here we go.  (""Just What I Needed"" by The Cars plays)  I guess you're just what I needed   Just what I needed   I needed someone to feed   I guess you're just what I needed   Just what I needed   I needed someone to bleed    I don't mind"

This place has untapped potential.  I mean, it's crazy that it hasn't taken off yet.  You love what you do,  and you have an amazing product.  I want to tap that potential.  I want to tap that!  I don't think you mean to say it like that.  Oh, yes, I do! â­I (laughs)  Okay, so, invest in me?  What are we talking about, here?  Well, for starters,  I write you a check for a $100,000.  (coughing)  You okay? Mm-hmm.  Are you crying?  (falsetto): No. No. No.  Is your voice getting higher? â­(falsetto): Yep!  Okay, anyway, we can talk about all sorts of things  branding, marketing, some sizzle.  Throw out some ideas.  You know, just business-partner stuff.  For you to take or leave.  Okay, yes!  I didn't really hear anything you said  after ""write you a check for $100,000,"" but yes!  Great! â­I can't believe this!  (phone rings) â­Hello?  GENE (deep voice): Hello, this is the fire department.  There's a ketchup fire upstairs  and we need all the fries you got!  $100,000. $100,000!  I mean, how much is that?  Show me the check again. Show me, show me, show me, show me.  I want to kiss it! Come here!  Mwah, mwah, mwah. Can I see it?  Wow, I never knew checks could have commas.  I even put an exclamation point in there.  I'm as excited as you guys are!  Okay, everybody stop touching the check.  I'm going to take it to the bank right now.  I bet he's gonna drop it in the gutter.  Don't drop it in the gutter, Bobby!  Don't you drop it!  Tape it to your chest!  BOB: I'm not going to drop it.  Oh, crap. Never mind, I got it!  Where are your pants, Gene?  I just came from New Geneland,  where you don't need pants.  Well, this is Linda-braska, so put 'em on.  So, New Geneland's pretty great, huh?  ""Pretty great."" It's amazing!  I got the TV right there,  and the pee plant is just a few steps away.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You watched TV after we went to bed?  No fair.  Yes, and if last night is any indication,  we are living in the golden age of late-night talk shows.  Did you say ""pee plant""?  And you are welcome to use it, sir.  Oh, thanks, but I'm-I'm covered.  I've got a pee shoe in your closet.  Oh, right. My rain boots.  I was kidding.  Do you really pee in your rain boots?  No    I would like to make a deposit, please.  Oh, Bob. Has it gotten this bad?  What? What-what do you mean?  Nothing. Just a moment,  I have to make a quick phone call.  Are you having your security guard stand over me?  No, no, no, no, shh, shh, shh, shh.  Hello, Mr. Warren Fitzgerald?  Yes, I'm the manager at the First Oceanside Savings Bank,  and I have a Bob Belcher here  trying to deposit a check  with your name on it for $100,000.  Oh, wow. Thank you for alerting me to this.  I have no idea who that  What did what did you say his name is? Bob Belcher?  Yeah, I-I have no idea who he is.  So it is fraud. Wait, wh-what?  He's saying you committed fraud.  I-I didn't, that's my friend.  W-what wait â­Thank you for confirming this,  and we'll have the proper authorities  Oh, wait, wait.  Bob Belcher. Yes, yes, yes.  I thought you said Boab Belcher.  It just sounded weird when you said it.  I did write him that check.  You did. â­WARREN: Mm-hmm.  And it wasn't a terrible mistake  you made by accident?  No. â­Or a lapse in judgment.  Nope. â­Serious head injury?  (chuckles) No. Are you sure?  I'm quite sure.  Okay, then, very well.  Ha! â­What, Bob?  Ha! Put that down  in the comments section on my account.  Bob says ""ha.""  Good one, Warren. You got me.  That guy was so ready to have you arrested, Bob.  Yep, that's my banker.  That should be their slogan:  ""We're ready to have you arrested!""  What are you guys doing?  Uh, measuring the window for an awning.  I take it you've met, then.  Yup. I heard all about it from Linda.  Congrats, Bob.  I always knew you'd make it big time  if one of your old friends ever made a bunch of money.  Thanks, Teddy. I already made a list of repairs  that we can get started on.  It's funny, it came out to exactly  $100,000 worth of work.  (laughs) It adds up.  It adds up, Bobby.  All right, take it easy, Teddy. â­Yeah. â­(bell jingles)  I'm riding this one out as far as she'll go, Bob!  This is my big break, too!  Quit smudging!  An awning could be a good idea. â­Sure.  But I'm surprised you went for the tiki thing.  (bell jingles) The tiki thing?  Yeah. You didn't know?  It's gonna be a palm-frond awning.  We're gonna tiki-fy the place.  ""Tiki-fy""?  Oh, you're pranking me.  I-I get it. Good one.  No, no, I'm serious, Bob.  It's business 101.  You need an entry point, a hook.  I-I figured we would use the money  to maybe upgrade some equipment,  or do some advertising, but  This is advertising!  You lure people in with something flashy and fun,  something that distinguishes you,  and once they're in, you wow them with your product.  Makes sense to me.  Thank you, Teddy.  My entry point is my bangs.  Then I wow them with my winning personality.  You wow me with your breath. â­Thank you.  Hey! I just realized it's called an awning  because it's ""on"" the window.  Oh, yeah!  It's just, tiki, I mean  should we talk about this?  Hey, if you don't like it, we can do something else,  but I think you're gonna like it.  It goes with the whole beach town thing.  You walk in here, see the tiki,  and you say, ""Yeah. It makes sense. Perfect.""  We do live by the beach.  I I don't know.  Don't-don't worry, Bob.  The destination is still your burger,  but the restaurant is the journey there.  Wow, I just got chills.  From me. â­Okay  Plus, I found a bunch of tiki stuff for sale  at a place that went out of business in Bog Harbor.  But they went out of business  so that doesn't seem like  They didn't have your superior product, Bob.  Tell you what, I'll go check that stuff out  and you keep Tik-ing about it.  See? All these fun jokes we can make?  Yup, that's great. (door opens, bell jingles)  I mean, we'll think of better ones, but you get the idea.  See you in a bit!  A theme? Lin, we already have a theme.  It's a restaurant. Restaurant theme.  It'll probably be  just a couple things  to spruce up the place, you know?  Nothing crazy.  So, this is a lot  of stuff.  Yeah, great stuff.  We got the tiki water pitchers,  the tiki salt and pepper shakers.  Tiki straws for tiki spitballs.  (door opens, bell jingles) Ow.  Umbrellas for the drinks.  In case it rains, keep the ice dry.  Couple of tiki statues ooh, scary!  Where do these guys go?  Wherever there's space  tables, countertops, everywhere! What's this?  That's to wrap around the bottom of the counter.  Ooh, our counter's gonna look  like a sexy hula dancer!  Should I start wearing a coconut bra?  No. â­Yes. Everybody's thinking it.  And here's the crown jewel of it all  PINEAPPLE: Aloha!  (gasps) You can talk!  (chuckles) It's on a motion detector.  You put it near the door, and when people walk by,  it says, ""Aloha."" I wanted that job.  Wow, I, uh, usually don't like sunglasses indoors,  but that pineapple really pulls it off.  That is one cool fruit.  People are gonna go crazy for that pineapple.  Yeah. â­What a time to be alive.  You're gonna love the giant volcano it sits on.  Will you give me a hand with it, Teddy?  Sure, sure. Moving mountains.  This is what God must feel like.  (bell jingles) (hesitantly): Well, this is very exciting.  And now we don't need to go to Hawaii.  (laughs) â­PINEAPPLE: Aloha!  Aloha to you.  Hey, pineapple, if I'm supposed to marry a cute boy  and live on a horse farm, say ""aloha.""  PINEAPPLE: Aloha! Yes.  And if you're kidding, say ""aloha"" again.  PINEAPPLE: Aloha! Damn.  Kids, enough. Leave the pineapple alone.  (Teddy and Warren grunting)  God, that is really giant.  WARREN: Yeah, I got the biggest one.  So what do you think, partner?  Great. Really great.  (grunts)  And this is all just the tip of the iceberg.  I have two words for you, Bob:  Mai-tai fries. What?  They're like daiquiri fries but Mai tai.  It's the next big thing. We'll talk about it later.  And here you go.  Aloha! â­Aloha!  Aloha! â­Aloha!  Eh, I will not get tired of this.  Nobody's gonna get tired of any of this stuff.  PINEAPPLE: Aloha!  I'm freaky for tiki!  PINEAPPLE: Aloha! BOB: Oh, my God.  Back to the Future. Mein Back.  Back to the Future II. Men in Back II.  Guess Who's Back? â­Yes!  Yes to which one?  Well, hers, 'cause it's a real movie,  and it's the one I was thinking of.  Oh, that's how you play.  Our team wins. â­And we lose.  Thanks for phoning it in, Dad.  Wow, that was great.  So this is what a real family does for fun, huh?  That was the first time we ever played charades.  We thought you wanted to do it.  Yeah, because you said, ""Should we play charades now?""  Either way, good game, everyone,  but I am beat. I got to hit the sack.  Good night, Bob's wonderful family. LOUISE: Sweet dreams.  TINA: Sleep tight. BOB AND LINDA: Good night.  Adios.  So, Bob, you've been a little quiet tonight.  Is everything okay?  Okay? Everything's great.  (Warren sings indistinctly) My old friend is here.  He's singing in the bathroom.  WARREN:  Ooh, got a little pee on the seat   But they'll never know it was me   He put $100,000 into our business,  and he is ""the guy,""  so it's all it's all it's good.  Oh. Good, good.  Hundred thousand dollars, Lin. â­Yeah.  And the guy knows what he's doing. â­Right.  Hundred thousand dollars. Guy knows what he's doing.  You just said that.  Oh, good. You heard it, too.  I'm gonna go to bed.  Everything's gonna be great.  Everything's great.  Great. Great, great, great, great, great, great,  great, great, great. Great.  Well, the king of New Geneland has grown weary, so peace out.  You know, Gene, I thought I'd do you a favor  and give you my room tonight.  Eh, I'll slum it out here. Thanks, but no.  I want to watch TV after everyone goes to bed.  You should have thought of that before you said, ""Not it!"" Snap.  Come on, just trade me one night.  There's nothing in the world I'd trade  for a night in New Geneland.  I'll give you my peanut that's shaped like a butt.  Deal, but for tomorrow night.  I've already got the Dutch oven set at the perfect temperature.  Fine.    Okay, pineapple, do your job.  Bring people in.  Aloha! â­No, I know.  That's what you say. â­Aloha!  Right, I'm just gonna stop talking to you now.  Just work your island magic. (bell jingles)  Aloha! â­Whoa.  Well, aloha to you, too.  This is fun.  Hi, uh, table for four?  Yes, please. Are you guys new?  No, we've actually been here a really long time.  Huh, we never noticed this place before,  and then we saw all the tiki stuff,  and we were like, ""Oh, that looks like fun.""  We are fun.  Yes, we are.  I'm gonna text Frank and tell him to bring everyone here.  Frank's gonna love this place.  So everything taste okay?  Super fun. â­Oh.  Uh, people normally don't say things taste ""fun,""  but as long as you're happy.  Frank, you good? â­Mmm!  (bell jingles) â­Aloha! â­(laughs)  Another box? â­Yep.  Warren sent me to get some Hawaiian shirts.  Hawaiian shirts?  Yeah, I think it's what the Hawaiian army wears.  Oh, this one's yours, Bob.  Huh, parrots. They're fun.  Ooh, you know what would go great with that shirt?  A real parrot. â­Worth a shot.  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.  Bob, are you doing okay?  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  You sure? â­Yep. Yep.  Your face is a little scrunchie.  (door opens, bell jingles) PINEAPPLE: Aloha!  Hey, tiki theme. Nice.  I'd eat here. (chuckles)  You're finally doing something right, Bob.  Pulled your head out of your butt,  you washed your hair,  and everything's fine.  Warren, we need to talk.  I know what you're gonna say:  ""Where are the rest of the menus?""  The kids are helping with a little redesign.  These menus are going from laminated to ""ka-blaminated.""  Ugh. Warren, I want to give you your money back.    What?! I think he said,  ""Would you like a bowl of Honey Smacks?""  Yeah, 'cause that makes a lot more sense  than ""I want to give you your money back.""  I'll take a bowl of Honey Smacks.    I'm not taking the money back, Bob.  Yes, you are. You have to.  No, I don't, and you can't make me.  Well, that's checkmate, Dad.  You got to keep it.  Yeah, and also we should probably keep it.  (sighs) This was a bad idea.  I-I never should have taken it in the first place.  I don't want to have to answer to someone else.  Even if it's a friend.  Especially if it's a friend.  So please take it back.  You're making a lot of great points,  but no, the answer's no.  Oh, and you're not making great points.  Well, I'm going to the bank  to get you a cashier's check. Well, I won't cash it.  Then I'll have the money wired to your account, Warren.  Then I'm gonna close all of my accounts, Bob.  Don't let him leave! Deploy menus!  Ow! Ow! Stop it. â­(grunting)  Ow! Stop! â­No!  Why are you so good at throwing menus?  What do you think we do all day?  So you want me to take the money from your account  and wire it back to Mr. Fitzgerald?  Yes, please.  Just saying it out loud sounds like a bad idea, so no.  Wait, what? You-you have to.  I do not have to.  I don't have his account number  or any idea who he banks with.  You have a copy of his check.  Well, not handy. â­Ugh, forget it.  Just cut me a cashier's check  made out to Warren Fitzgerald.  Okay, Bob.  You know best.  He said unconvincingly.    (bell jingles) â­Aloha! â­Don't you dare.  Please tell me you didn't wire Warren's money back  and ruin our futures.  Our already fragile futures.  Of course he didn't.  He wouldn't do that without discussing it  with his wife, right, Bob?  They wouldn't let me wire the money.  Oh, thank God. â­Oh, good. Good for them.  Oh, thank God. â­So I got the cashier's check.  Son of a bitch! Damn it!  I told you, Bob, I won't cash it.  Warren, you're taking your money back.  You are making a huge mistake.  Your business is just starting to click.  Look around. I can't do this, Warren.  This? This isn't us.  This isn't who we are.  Not even the pineapple?  It kind of looks like Tina.  Huh, I see it.  Especially the pineapple!  So here, take the check.  No. â­I'm putting it in your hand, Warren.  Close your hand. â­I won't!  Take it!  And take all of your stupid tiki stuff.  It's not stupid, Bob. It's an entry point.  Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. LINDA: Oh! Oh!  Tiki's not stupid, it's fun.  Of course you'd say that.  You're stupid, too.  You're all stupid. â­Hey.  Sorry, I didn't mean that, you're not you're not stupid.  Thank you. But you didn't come here for the food,  you came here for the tiny umbrellas  and the talking pineapple.  I love that pineapple.  And that's a really dumb way to choose a place to have lunch!  Why are you throwing a tantrum, Tantrum O'Neil?!  Because I â­Hey.  Hate tiki! â­What  (sighs) Well, tiki's â­(grunts)  a great idea!  Ow! You are taking this check  if I have to shove it in your pocket myself.  Don't let him in there, Warren!  TINA: Turn your pockets inside out like a magician!  WARREN: Hey! GENE: Tiki tussle!  Uh, they're old friends.  They're-they're friends.  (slow-motion): Aloha!  GENE: No! (Warren yells)  Okay, okay.  I'll take the check.  Good. Finally.  Rip, rip, rip, rip, rip, rip, rip.  Damn it!  You think you can just come in here and change everything,  just because you're a huge success?!  No, I'm a success just because I have a lot of money,  I drive a nice car,  I recently got my pilot's license for the plane I bought.  That's what makes me a success!  Yes, you're the guy.  You were always the guy.  You were the leader. (grunts)  Bob, you were the guy.  What? Y-you thought I was the guy?  Dad was the Fonz?  (gasps) That makes Mom Pinky Tuscadero.  Yes, you were the leader.  We all wanted to be like you.  I mean, ""we"" was just me and that other kid  who hung around with us that one summer,  but still, and look at you now.  You built this place.  You're doing what you love.  You have something really special here,  and I wanted to be a part of it.  To be like you.  And I tried to buy my way in.  I think you should be able to buy your way in.  Right? Am I am I alone? Anyone?  Absolutely. Yes.  No, I can't.  This was your baby, and I never should have tried to tap that.  Thanks, Warren.  Honestly, you don't need me or my money.  It's only a matter of time before this place takes off.  Well, I don't know about that, but maybe.  Probably not. Maybe.  Maybe? Of course we're gonna make it.  Eventually.  Someday. Right?  And you don't need a partner.  You already have one, and she's perfect for you.  Who? (gasps) Oh, me.  (Louise clears throat) WARREN: Yeah, all of you.  Having a family like this is worth way more than $100,000.  Probably $200,000.  $175,000 to $200,000.  Uh, I get it. We work well together.  I'm really sorry, Bob.  Thanks, pal. Me-me, too.  Uh, and I'm sorry I dumped all over your tiki idea.  There's nothing wrong with tiki.  I would have hated any theme.  I'm a burger man, not a this man.  Uh-huh, of course, of course.  What if it had been a space theme? â­No.  Underwater? Submarines? No, no, no, no.  Oh, bus-station bathroom!  Maximum-security prison!  Shoe store?  Shoe store theme!  But we'll sell burgers.  Oh, I'm gonna write these down.  Just in case. Be right back.    Not only was I able  to unload all that tiki stuff,  I sold it for ten percent more than I paid for it.  Of course you did.  I just can't lose.  Great, so here's a second cashier's check.  Thanks, Bob.  Rip, rip, rip, rip. â­No, no, no!  Just kidding.  I'm kidding. â­(sighs)  Thanks for taking it back.  (Louise grunting)  Louise, stop trying to grab it.  You couldn't cash it anyway.  Don't tell me what I can't cash.  All right, kids, time for bed.  Say good night to Uncle Warren.  Good night! â­Night!  Good night!  Good night, everybody.  It's all yours, Louise.  Finally.  Leave only footprints, take only memories.  Remember this, remember that, remember this.  Well, it's your last night here, Warren.  Anything you want to do?  Go grab a beer downstairs?  You got it.  Oh, not with you.  Oh, I thought What?  Gotcha.  (chuckling): I can't wait for you to leave.  I think I'll check out what's on the tube  before hitting the hay.  Where's the remote?  I hid it.  No TV, Louise. â­What?!  Gene got to watch TV.  Well, yeah, he's the king of New Geneland.  What?! â­Good night.  WARREN:  I love charades   It's a fun game   I could play all day   He loves charades   Oh, got a little pee on the seat   Seat   Ooh, got a little pee on the seat   But they'll never know   They'll never know   Ooh, got a little pee on the seat   But they'll never know it was me   Never know it was you."

Jealous? â­I'll live.  I want to be like you, Mike.  You want to be a billionaire  who delivers mail for fun?  What?! â­Just kidding.  I'm not a billionaire, but I'm rich in mail.  Get

reason Boyz 4 Now broke up.  I have a Boo Boo boo boo on my soul.  Why don't you do it without me?  And how would that work, exactly?  This is your world, T.  Right, but you're the one who has a crush.  I do not have a crush on Boo Boo.  I slapped him out of my system!  I slapped him out!  Okay, but at the concert you were not  I don't even remember that concert  and I do not have dreams about it ever.  Sure, sure.  So, you don't get chills  when you hear Boo Boo sing  Let me dry your tears   Because you just pierced your ears   (moans)  You have tears in your ears, girl   (grunts)  You have tears in your ear   Stop! The line is,  ""Are those tears in your ears?""  It's a question!  Whoops. â­Aha!  Okay, Tina, we can play the gotcha game,  but here's the truth:  today you don't like Boo Boo, but tomorrow you might,  and you'll be kicking yourself  for not entering this contest.  What if the fan club finds out?  We took a motion.  We did a chant.  Chants are not legally binding  in our state, okay, Tina?  You're right, and you're my sister.  I-I want to do this for you.  Okay, we're doing it for you,  but yeah, great, let's do it.  Bobby, think about it.  It could go right here. I don't know.  Do we really want to be the murder restaurant?  If it comes with a plaque like this, sure.  So official.  We're like the White House.  Hey, what are you doing, Bob?  Putting up a warning sign?  Danger: Dumb Guy Inside. (laughs)  Zoom!  Good one, Jimmy. â­Yeah.  Whoa, there was a mob hit at this place?  No fair, how did you get something cool?  Hmm well, bye.  Hey, I-I-I love mob stuff.  I-I mean the clothes, the dames, the movies.  Oh, I love the movies!  Okay, see you later.  Johnny Dangerously.  Joe Piscopo in his prime.  Now, that's the movie that made me  want to be an Italian.  So, you gonna put this, uh, plaque up or what?  No, we're not.  You're not gonna do anything at all with this, huh?  Uh no.  Huh good to know.  (laughs) Good to know.  W-Wait, that doesn't mean you can do something, Jimmy.  Bada bing, Bob.  This is still our mob hit.  I can't hear you over me saying, ""Bada bing, Bob!""  Bada bing.  Linda, stop it.  It's fun to say, it's Italian.  It's not Italian.  JIMMY (muffled): Bada bing, Bob.  Bada bing.  Stop saying ""Bada bing""!  Boo Boo's coming to Wonder Wharf this Saturday.  So, the crew that gets the most sign-ups  for Boo Boo's e-mail list wins the roller coaster ride.  Am I missing something?  Can it be that easy?  Our Boo Crew is just you and me.  Kind of more of a Boo Two.  Not if we have Gene  You had me at ""Not if we have Gene.""  and that makes three,  and maybe we'll scout around,  fill out the ranks a little bit.  Who's gonna help us?  Right now everyone hates Boo Boo except us.  It's like that Boyz 4 Now song,  ""Girl, Everyone Hates You Now Except Us.""  What we need are a couple of cold-blooded mercenaries  who will do anything for the right price.  (gargles) Now you try it.  (gargles) Now you try it.  This stuff is great!  Let's try to breathe it!  Okay!  (Andy and Ollie coughing)  Andy, Ollie, I know you guys got a lot going on  right now, but we need your help.  Yay! â­Yay!  Hello, kind sir, sign up  for Boo Boo's mailing list?  Are you walking away 'cause you want me to follow you?  We didn't get any e-mails, but Ollie found a paper clip.  And Andy found a hundred dollars.  Trade you for that paper clip. Okay!  Oh, no. â­What?  It's Krissy. If she finds out  about our Boo Crew she'll be â­Tina?  Krissy, crazy running into you here.  Does your shirt say ""Boo Crew""?  No, it says, ""boo-merang"" because I like boomerangs,  because I'm from Australia.  G'day, mate. â­Nice.  Move the clipboard for a second?  What clipboard? This clipboard or your clipboard?  You don't have a clipboard. Krissy, are you okay?  Look at this hardworking Boo Crew.  Boo Boo forever, right?  Gene.  Tina, you joined  a Boo Crew?!  What the hell?!  What happened to my boomerang shirt?  This is actionable.  You're out of the Boyz 4 Now fan club, Tina.  You're out! â­Krissy, please  Okay, everyone's getting a little hot.  We're all just people wearing T-shirts,  trying to get through the day.  I've made my decision.  Hand over your membership card  and forget the secret handshake. Forget it!  I lost my membership card, and I never really knew  the handshake that well to begin with, it keeps changing, so  I know it. How do I know it?  Good-bye, Tina.  (nervous groaning)  (nervous groaning)  Tina?  You with me, girl?  I loved that fan club,  and Krissy just tossed me aside like  one of Griffin's sweat towels after he does  the Maniac dance during the Boyz 4 Now cover of ""Maniac,""  which appeared on their covers album We Got You Covered!  Easy, girl, easy.  (sighs)  I don't know if I can do this.  Whoa, quitting is not an option.  Do you hear me?  Okay, maybe just  you know, take some Tina time.  Gene, uh, rub her back.  Let me know how my pressure is.  (groaning)  You've sacrificed a lot, Tina.  We all have.  Not really.  Yeah, mostly Tina.  Bup, bup, bup, shh!  We are so close to winning this thing,  I can just slap it.  I mean, taste it.  What's happening over at Pesto's?  Okay, okay, gather around. BOB: Oh, my God.  I told you he'd do this.  So, recently some kind of history guy came over  and gave me the best news of my life.  Back in nineteen-eleventy-seven,  a real-life mobster was gunned down in my restaurant.  You got to be kidding me, Jimmy!  It happened right here, folks,  in this very establishment.  He's lying!  It happened at my restaurant!  Right over there!  Oh, yeah?  Then how come I'm the one with the plaque?  (crowd gasps)  He bada-binged us.  ""On this spot in Prohibition times,  ""a mobster got whacked while eating.  This became the basis for the hit film Dick Tracy.""  What?! That's ridiculous! Hold on, Bob.  The guy from the paper wants a picture.  Cheese pizza!  Now I'd like to invite everyone to come in and  (Ã  la Tony Montana): say hello to my little drink specials!  (laughs)  Rat-a-tat-a-tat-a-tat-a-tat.  Rat-a-tat-a-tat-tat-da-da-da.  Jimmy, you can't just put up a plaque and make it true.  I have history on my side!  Easy, easy, Bob.  It's okay.  History's dumb, everyone knows it.  It's like, been there, done that.  I can't believe it.  We've been doing this for three days.  We haven't gotten a single e-mail for the mailing list.  People do not seem to trust us  with their personal information.  Here we go, two live ones coming.  Excuse me, hi!  Do you have a moment to chat about Boo Boo or  where are you going? â­Sorry.  They're getting away! Blockers, get them!  Windmill arms!  (girl yells)  Your loss!  You're really bad at this.  Robin? â­What do you want?  Look, I shouldn't be here,  but things have gotten kind of weird in the club.  After Krissy kicked you out,  she called everyone over to her house  and, I'm not gonna lie, Tina,  some horrible things were said about you  and Boo Boo.  Mostly about Boo Boo? Mostly you  Right, right, right.  And mostly by me,  but here's the thing:  you gave Krissy the idea  to turn the fan club into a Boo Crew.  Really? But they hate Boo Boo.  Exactly.  When Krissy suggested  entering Boo Boo's contest,  we were all like, ""What?""  But her plan was diabolical.  She said she wanted to win that roller coaster ride  with Boo Boo, eat a bunch of junk food at the wharf,  and go from Boo Crew to Spew Crew.  I like that the last part rhymed  but I don't think I know what it means.  I mean they're gonna throw up on Boo Boo.  Oh, no. â­What?! Yup, they're gonna get  every snack on the Wharf: chili (Tina and Louise gasping)  chili boats tacos  taco boats corn dogs Don't say corn dog boats!  Corn dog boats  (yells)  and it's all gonna  be on Boo Boo's face.  They're going puke-ular.  Why are you telling us this?  'Cause I used to like Boo Boo  and I don't like throwing up on people.  I like throwing up on people.  I mean, I don't love it, but I'll do it. TINA: Mm.  Boo Boo may have broken up the band,  but at the end of the day  Boo Boo was the band.  Exactly.  I mean, hmm, you think so?  Cool perspective and no wonder people are so upset.  And by the way, Krissy's got, like, a million sign-ups.  What?! We can't get anyone to sign up!  How does she do it?  Her Dad signed everyone up  at his company without them knowing.  It was crazy.  I think he might go to jail.  Krissy and her dad aren't  the only ones who can play dirty.  Yeah, Krissy's mom, too.  No, I meant us.  (cheerful music plays)  Just look at him out there.  (Jimmy laughing) Unbelievable.  Forget him, Bob.  You didn't want to put up the plaque, anyway.  That's not the point!  He's lying, Lin, he's a total fraud!  Jimmy's not gonna get away with this.  Bob, what are you gonna do?  I'm gonna call that history professor.  Oh tough guy!  We got a lot of sign-ups.  I think we might just have a shot at this thing.  I mean, you might, Tina.  I-I don't care.  It's okay for you to be excited, Louise.  Yeah, it's okay for you to be excited.  Right listen, every day at around 2:30,  my armpits get sweaty  Okay  and I used to hate  raising my hand in class to answer a question,  but one day I had to say, who cares?  I have swampy armpits and I'm gonna answer  all the questions I want.  I'm swampy and I'm proud.  Tina, where are you going with this?  I'm saying, just because you think something  is embarrassing doesn't mean  you have to be embarrassed by it.  We all have our swampy pits.  My swampy pits is swampy pits.  Maybe your swampy pits is Boo Boo.  Mm-hmm, have you tried Dad's deodorant?  It's, like, military grade.  He gets it on the Dark Web.  Good morning, Boo Boo Boosters!  It's a beautiful day to love Boo Boo!  Oh, I hope we win!  That's what I was hoping, too.  We're going to win.  Boo Squared is gonna be out here in a bit,  but first let's find out which lucky Boo Crew won  the Ride a Roller Coaster with Boo Boo contest!  Ah the suspense is  Krissy Davis' crew, that's who won.  Oh, no!  (Krissy cheering)  Hell yes, Krissy! Hell yes, Krissy!  Sorry, I should have drawn that out more, made it suspenseful.  No!  All right, let's get the winning  Boo Crew up here onstage!  This can't be right.  Recount, recount!  So, Krissy, you and your crew  are seconds away from meeting Boo Boo.  How do you feel?  (mumbling)  (laughs) Lovely girl.  Oh, my God.  She's gonna be so full of corn dogs.  Hey, look out!  (music blasting) She's gonna throw up on Boo Boo!  They're all gonna  Boo Boo, everybody!  (gasps) Boo Boo!  Boo Boo's big enough to ride!  Yeah!  Just kissing the line there.  Now let's get these crazy kids on the roller coaster.  (yelling)  No, no, no, no.  You're not allowed up here.  You don't get it! They're gonna  (Louise groans)  Their puke is on your hands!  I mean, it's gonna be on his face, but  Thanks again for coming, Professor.  So, the plan is, we burst in there, we get everyone's  attention with the photo, and then you tell them  where it really happened.  Now I know how Freddie the Face must have felt  right before taking out The Grunt.  Where's the plaque, by the way?  You should have gotten it by now.  Huh, I don't know.  Maybe it got lost in the mail.  I mean, I bet that happens a lot with, uh, plaques.  You don't know the half of it.  Okay, here we go.  (indistinct chatter)  All right, now?  Not yet.  It happened right there.  Can you believe it?  Rat-a-tat-a-tat- a-tat-a-tat-a-tat.  That's what it sounded like.  See, I'm good at sounds.  Now? Or  And he's all (screams)  and the blood's going  wow!  It was like, zoom!  (laughs)  (distorted): It's the best thing  that's ever happened to me!  Rat-a-tat-a-tat- a-tat-a-tat-a-tat.  I can't do it.  I've never seen him so happy.  I-I'm calling off the hit.  What?!  I mean, look at him.  H-He needs this.  Taking it away from him  would be like taking a toy  away from a giant, stupid baby.  But he seems like such a jerk.  He is.  He's what we historians  would call a douche bag.  I know.  Here, come back to my place.  I-I'll buy you a burger.  You're my best friend, Bob.  Really? Uh, okay.  They're having the ride of their lives up there with Boo Boo!  When's it gonna happen?  When's it gonna happen, Robin?!  I don't know!  I left before Krissy worked out the details.  Well, it's got to happen soon,  the ride's almost over.  I'm not scared! I'm not scared!  I'm not scared! I'm not scared! I'm not scared  You're crushing it up there,  Boo Boo, crushing it!  That was the last turn.  They're almost done.  Maybe they couldn't throw up  so they just burped in his face.  Oh, my God.  It was never supposed to happen  on the roller coaster.  What do you mean?  A roller coaster is a horrible place  to barf on someone.  The barf would get everywhere,  it might even miss Boo Boo.  Who's Miss Boo Boo?  Is she our teacher?  All right, time for a photo  with Boo Boo and the lucky winners.  Out of my way!  (Louise grunts)  (girls heaving) Hmm. Ooh.

"1  Dear Diary, how are you?  I am fine.  (sighs) Okay, I'm not fine.  You got me. God, you're good.  It's just I'm 13 and never even ridden a horse.  I mean, my imaginary horse, Jericho's, great, of course,  but I'm ready for the real thing.  And I've found just the right place.  It's the week-long Hoof Dreams Horse Camp in Montana.  You get to participate in a live horse birth.  And a sunrise ride to the top of a mountain  where a Native American gives you  an honorary horse-inspired name.  And that at the end, you get to keep the horse.  So it's a really great bang for your buck ing bronco.  Just a little joke.  Anyway, I just wish there was some way  I could express all this to Mom and Dad.  The end.  Huh. Do people normally read  their diary entries out loud?  Oh. Did you guys hear that?  How is Jericho the imaginary horse these days?  He's good.  He just got his imaginary bangs trimmed,  and I think it's made him much more confident.  Look, we know you want to go to that horse camp, Tina.  You've left pamphlets everywhere.  Like here, under my food ugh.  Well, then you know there's still time  to sign me up this summer.  And there's still time to sign me up  for Ham Slam: The ham convention in Orlando.  We just can't afford horse camp, honey.  It costs 2,000 bucks.  Dad would have to work until he was 90.  That's in ten years, Tina.  I'm not 80. We barely have enough  to fix the deep fryer, Tina.  It's been broken for two days,  so we've got to use (moaning)  Tina, I'm sor â­(moaning)  Uh, I thought you were done. Okay.  All right. Well, take your time.  That's fine. All right. That's fine.  (moaning continues)  Hey, what's up, Tina?  Why the long face?  Hi, Jericho.  It's just that I can't go  to the Hoof Dreams Horse Camp,  so now I'll probably be sad for the rest of my life,  but besides that I'm good.  Oh, Tina, you have the hardest life sometimes,  and yet, you're so strong. I know.  Hey, who needs real horses, anyway?  Can a real horse do this?  (scatting)  Probably not.  Here. Move over.  Hmm. â­Just little more.  (grunts) â­Scooch.  Come on. A little more.  I can't go anymore.  I know what will cheer you up.  Tell me the story of how we met.  I don't know if I'm in the mood.  Just kidding. I am.  (laughs) Oh, Tina.  TINA: So there we were.  Shipwrecked on a deserted island.  JERICHO: What was I like?  TINA: You were wild.  (whinnies)  No one could tame you, except one girl named me.  Come on. Come on.  No. â­Come on. Come on.  Nuh-uh. No. â­Got some leaves.  I'm wild. â­I know, but look.  I'm wild. â­They're so good.  I would never eat out of your Han  Oh, my God, I'm doing it.  Gallup, Gallup, Gallup, Gallup.  Gallup, Gallup, Gallup, Gallup,  Gallup, Gallup, Gallup, Gallup,  Gallup, Gallup, Gallup, Gallup.  Yay!  You tamed me! (laughing)  (yells)  I'm okay.  (laughing)  (whooping)  Yikes. Yeah.  We got to get this girl to horse camp.  Pronto.  LOUISE: So, yeah, just sell this stuff.  Use the money to pay for Tina's horse camp,  and give us whatever's leftover.  You're welcome.  Guys, it's very sweet of you,  but we're not selling your stuff.  Plus, no offense, but I don't think  it would cover the cost.  I mean, this is a pinecone.  GENE: Mr. Pinecone.  We got to do something, people!  You know we could push off  fixing the deep fryer for a few months,  and use that money to send Tina  to a cheaper horse camp around here.  Yeah, but we need the deep fryer fixed.  We need fries.  Do you though, Dad? I mean,  the restaurant's called Bob's Burgers,  not Bob's Burgers and Fries.  Yeah, just 'cause fries are salty and delicious  and no one in history  has ever eaten a burger without them,  doesn't mean we should serve them.  Come on, Bobby, please?  For Tina?  (sighs) What the hell. Let's do it.  Maybe we don't need fries for now.  Yeah, okay, yeah?  All right! â­Yeah!  We're pushing off the deep fryer repair.  (laughing): Our lives are so exciting.  LINDA: Tina!  Come here, baby. We got something to tell ya!  (moaning)  I know. Time for breakfast.  Thanks for including me.  No. Not that. This.  (groans) Great. Now I need a spoon.  Can anything ever go right?  Tina (whistles). Up here.  For God's sake, look up, woman!  ALL: Hurray!  (mimics fanfare)  Sorry, my glasses are smudgy.  Let me just clean them real quick. â­Oh, my God.  Hmm. Okay.  ""You're going to"" (gasps)  Now, it's not the Montana one, sweetie,  but it's a very affordable day camp  that's close by. Hurray!  Did you did you hear that, Tina?  Is she breathing?  Did we kill her?  (whispering): I'm so happy.  What? What she's saying? What was that?  I'm so happy! â­BOB: Oh.  Hooray! â­All right! Horse camp!  Ow, Tina. Too hard.  Well, Jericho, this is it.  My first day of horse camp.  I'm finally going to get to ride a real horse.  Wow. I'm-I'm really happy for you.  I really treasure the time we've had together.  Me, too. (chuckles)  And I'll never forget you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's happening here?  Oh, I just assume  that when I get home, you'll be gone.  What? Why would you assume that?  Because you're an imaginary horse,  and I'm about to ride a real horse, and I just  What? No, no, no. I'm not imaginary.  You're the you're the imaginary one.  Not me. You are!  Jericho, please.  Don't start that again.  Last time you said it, it really messed me up.  But I'm real! I'm real! I'm real!  I'm real!  Hey, hey.  Come here.  (sobbing)  I didn't know this would be our last day together.  I know, let's make it count.  What am I even wearing?  Wearing cutoffs?  I didn't even dress for this!  You look great, Jericho.  (crying): Oh, God. â­There, there.  There, there, there, there, there.  Oh, Tina! â­Okay, okay, okay.  All right. â­Oh, Tina.  All right. I got to go.  What? I-I got to go. Bye.  No, wait. Don't go.  There, there. Bye.  No, no, no. I got no.  I-I got to go. It's okay.  I'll treasure you forever.  (sobbing)  LINDA: I'll pick you up at 4:00, honey.  Have a good first day at horse camp.  Thanks, Mom.  (sighs)  I am home.  Oh, hell neigh.  Ugh. â­Hi, Tina.  Tammy, Jocelyn.  What a fun surprise, you guys are here.  Well, it was either this  or going to visit my grandmother,  and she's like older than my parents.  Ew, gross.  LINDA: Aw, one of my babies,  finally going to camp.  But what about Gene and Louise?  Poor, no-camp Gene and Louise.  It's so unfair. Unless  (clattering) Oh, Linda! Watch the road.  There you go, Teddy.  Great. Where are the fries?  Teddy, remember? We used the deep fryer money  for Tina's horse camp, so  Right. Right.  Tina's horse camp.

Sorry Dad.  We'd love to finish with all this,  but we're off to camp.  Hello.  I'm Doris, your instructor.  And welcome to Horsing Around Riding Center,  where a horse is a horse, of course, of course.  I'm contractually obligated to say that.  If it's a reference, I don't recognize it.  Let's get started.  First horse sighting. Nice.  So this here is Duchess, and she is a  Palomino. 13 hands high. No 14.  Uh, correct.  Let's go over some terminology, shall we?  Uh, does anyone know what this is?  The withers. â­Uh-huh.  Can anyone tell me what The crest.  (groans) But how about  The chestnut.

All right.  This is hard to watch. (Linda groaning)  Hey, hey!  What, Teddy?  You fix the deep fryer, yet?!  No, Teddy, it's been, like, two hours.  Well, fix it.!  It's fine.

What a pretty name.  Why is he called Pl  (plopping)  Okay. That makes sense.  Alison, you're with Sugarcube.  Okay, bond with him.  Maybe open with a joke.  Knock-knock.  And then you say, ""who's there?""  Then I say, Orange.  And then you say, ""Orange who?""  You turn away from me, um, okay.  I'm just going to follow you.  Do you want to just stand still for a second,  hear this funny joke? (plopping)  Oops.

The date!  Oh, do you have a blue dress?  I think so. And I still have my pearls.  They're in a storage unit.  I thought I'd never need them again.  I can get them for you. So?  Should we write the admiral and make a date for a dance?  Yes! I can't believe this is happening.  I feel like a schoolgirl! â­Me, too!  I mean, I am a schoolgirl.  But Yay! â­Yay!  So pretty.  I wish I were a 90-year-old going to a dance.  Okay, Mom, that's enough pearl time.  Give 'em back.  Yeah, it's my turn. Again?  I helped Tina find them, I earned double pearl time.  But I drove you to Meryl's storage unit.  Hmm.  Uh, hi, can I ask a question?  Why does pearl time have to happen in here  while I'm trying to take a nap?  Why are you taking a nap during pearl time?  Yeah. â­No, no, it's okay.  Let's clear out, kids.  Your father needs a disco nap so he can go party  with his chef friends.  That's not all we do, Lin,  we talk shop.  It's like a chef roundtable  that happens at a round table at a restaurant  where they sell a lot of alcohol.  An alcohol restaurant.  You're an amazing role model, Dad.  Thanks, Louise.  Meryl, I brought the Glam Squad.  Louise, plug in the curlers.  A ""please"" would be nice.  Gene, plug in the tunes.  I hope you like reggae.  Let's take Meryl  from senior to have-you-seen-her?  (shudders)  Just a little more blush.  Little more.  Okay, maybe a little less.  (grunts)  Hi, Aunt Meryl.  What's going on in here?  Joel!  Did we have a visit today?  Yeah, we did, it's my birthday.  Oh, of course.  Let me get my checkbook.  Wait, Joel, I thought your birthday was last week.  Well, you're wrong.  My birthday is today.  Right, Aunt Meryl?  Joel visits every year on his birthday.  Hmm.  Sounds like, at the rate you're having birthdays,  pretty soon you're gonna be older than Meryl.  Uh can I have a word with my aunt in private?  I want to talk about nephew stuff.  Joel puts the ""ew"" in ""nephew.""  Yeah, and also the ""eh.""  Oh, hey, Joel.  We weren't just talking about you.  Same here.  Happy birthday.  But not today because it's not your birthday today.  Unless it is and last week wasn't.  Um â­Nailed you.  Now, what should we do with your hair?  Lady mullet. I used to wear it up.  Boo.  Tina, question. Where are the pearls?  On the dresser.  Not anymore.  TINA (gasps): The pearls.  They're gone.  (gasps) Joel!  (grunts) Joel will never be able to pull those off.  I got a call from a Meryl Winters about stolen pearls.  Uh, one moment, Sergeant Bosco.  Hey, Meryl, we'll be just a sec.  Nothing happening out here. Heh.  No problem, I'm happy to have some alone time.  Sergeant Bosco, we called you.  Meryl has no idea her pearls were stolen.  Because you kids stole them?  What? No.  Her nephew Joel stole them.  But she doesn't know that either.  She can't know any of this until after tonight.  We have a big date with a retired navy admiral.  Okay, so Joel the nephew stole the pearls  on the night of the big date with the retired navy admiral.  Let me just close my notebook here.  Don't waste my time. (kids grunting)  I'm a real policeman.  It's true, there really are stolen pearls.  (quietly): But we need to keep it a secret.  I've got a secret for you.  I'm leaving.  That's not how secrets work!  I'll let you know if anything turns up  in the process of my exhaustive investigation.  Hello, Mother.  Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!  MERYL: Tina, you okay?  Yep, I was just saying,  ""Damn it, this dance is gonna be damn great. Damn it!""  Here you go. Burger of the Day, Teddy.  Uh what is it?  Well, it's an open-faced burger with ketchup gel  and emulsified cheese.  Where's the bun? It's on the bottom.  Why would you put it on the bottom?  It's supposed to be on the top, eh.  Because it's a new presentation, Teddy.  Where's the lettuce? It's under the foam.  What, am I supposed to wash my hands in this?  Gross. â­(sighs)  Taj and I came up with it last night.  It sounded good when we were talking about it,  but I realized today it takes me an hour to make.  Eh, a little more.  While we're on the subject of being a little ""eh,""  what's with the coat? His friend Lionel gave it to him.  The jacket looks good,  but you, on the other hand, ugh.  (sighs) Yeah, I don't feel so great.  I mean, last night was pretty crazy.  Lionel wanted to go to the fish market  to get first pick of the line-caught swordfish,  but we never made it 'cause we kept stopping off for drinks.  Geez, Bob, you're really burning the candle at both ends.  You can't keep this up, Bob.  I know you think these are your people,  but you're old enough to be their not very cool uncle.  Well, I'm pretty sure we're all staying in tonight.  I mean, we got to take a break at some point.  Ugh, Lionel wants to meet a restaurant  in Little Romania tonight.  I'm not gonna go.  He says I'm going. I guess I'm going.  But I-I'm not gonna drink.  ""We're all drinking tsuica.""  It's Romanian schnapps apparently.  Oh, my God.  Well, it was nice knowing you, Bob.  I'll take good care of Linda and the kids for you.  Thanks, Teddy.  You need any help with your dress, Meryl?  I'm okay. I don't remember  (muffled): being a turtleneck.  You have your head through the arm hole.  But other than that, you look great.  So what do we do about the necklace?  Look, chalky white mints.  They're not that good. Avoid.  No, if we get some dental floss and some glue,  we'll have some pearls.  Some fresh smelling pearls.  So we're not gonna tell her that her nephew stole her necklace.  Later, after the dance. We'll break it to her then,  and she'll be so in love with the admiral,  that she won't even care that her nephew's a thief.  I just know it.  The admiral.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.  There is no admiral.  What? â­What?  Joel comes every week and gets a $25 birthday check,  but he wants more.  And he knows Aunt Meryl has pearls,  but he doesn't know where she keeps them.  Uh-huh, uh-huh. Nodding along but confused.  Joel creates the admiral and this romantic dance baloney  so she'll take her pearls out  from wherever she's storing them,  and once they're here, they're easy to swipe.  Joel sent that letter, don't you see?  No, it can't be.  Come on, Tina, Joel shows up on the exact same day  the admiral's supposed to come?  Isn't that a little coincidental?  ""You wear your dress and pearls,  and I'll wear my navy whites.""  Whites. Whites.  And I still have my pearls.  They're in a storage unit.  Unit. Unit.  Can I have a word with my aunt in private?  (voice slowing down): Private. Private.  Oh, my God.  When you replied to ""the admiral,""  you set this whole thing in motion.  Sorry, T, this romance is a ""faux-mance.""  Huh, huh, huh, huh.  Tina, are you okay?  Meryl, we have something to tell you.  I have something to tell you, too.  I haven't had anything to look forward to in quite some time.  They're not as ""handsy-outsy"" with the meds  as they used to be around here.  But tonight I have something to look forward to.  Thanks to you, Tina.  I'm Gene. â­Where's Tina?  I'm over here.  Tina, move your arms around.  It'll help me see.  (grunts)  There you are, my magnificent matchmaker.  Uh  Uh, Meryl, will you excuse us for a second?  Okay.  You guys, the admiral might not be real,  but Meryl's dance can be. Huh?  This can still work. We just need an admiral.  So her nephew fooled her and now we're gonna fool her, too?  But we're fooling her for love, not for money.  I'll tell her the truth after the dance.  Well, that won't be a totally awkward conversation.  Meryl, get ready because the admiral is on his way.  (whispering): After we find an admiral.  And after we find more mints.  This hat was once a Tom Skerritt in Top Gun Halloween costume  and now look at it. Hmm.  I think this is gonna work.  He's starting to look like a real admiral, sort of.  (groans) â­And we found a good use  (muttering) â­for your super special chef jacket.  This is such, such a bad idea.  Shh. It's all a dream.  Go back to sleep.  (whispering): He's weak, he can't stop us.  Keep taping. I got to sit down.  You are sitting down, Dad. Oh, my God.  So you think Meryl won't notice  this cheese on your father's shoulders?  Her eyesight is really bad.  So you think she won't notice there's a little bite out of it?  Mom, don't eat the shoulder cheese.  Aw.  (groans) I really need a nap.  Damn it, sailor, you can nap after  you've given Meryl a night of romance.  That means a smooch, too, if she wants it.  Gene. â­Mm.  Okay, Meryl, you ready?  I think so.  You look great,  and your pearls have never looked more real.  Thank you. Hit it, Gene.  (big band music playing)  Oh.  Um  Hello, Meryl.  I'm Peter, uh  retired Admiral  of the Navy.  Peter, hi.  Good evening, Admiral.  You look as beautiful as I remember.  You look official.  May I have this dance?  I'd be honored.  TINA: It's working.  Aw, they look so cute together.  LOUISE: I hope they have weird, old babies.  Aw, weird, old babies.    Is that cheese? â­Oh. Yeah.  I was, uh, given  the cheese by the Swiss Navy.  What's happening to your uniform?  It's, um it's old.  Oh, no.  You tried, T.  (sighs) I got to tell her.  MAN: Meryl?    What the hell? Who's that?  The male nurses here really dress up.  Who are you?  It's me, Admiral Peter Wilcox.  Huh? â­Huh? â­What?!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, the admiral's real.  But who are you? â­Oh, uh,  I guess I'm not Admiral Peter Wilcox.  I'm, um, Admiral William P-Peacocks.  Wh-What a mix-up.  Dismissed! Dismissed!  Oh. Right. Uh  Excuse me. Admiral.  Admiral?  Meryl, may I finally have this dance?  Uh y-yes.  That other one was too old for me, I think.  And soft. I mean, I like Jell-O,  but I don't want to dance with it.  I don't get it. The admiral is real?  I guess I was right about all this romance stuff.  I knew it! I mean, I doubted it,  but before that, I knew it.  All right, maybe the admiral is real,  but Joel still took the pearls.  That's not romantic, that's cold-blooded.  (snoring)  LOUISE: Oh, my God, the pearls!  Whoa. Meryl had the pearls in her purse.  They weren't stolen at all.  Hey, you were wrong about everything, Louise.  (laughs): Okay, that's not how I'd put it.  Hooray for romance! True love does exist.  Remind me to tell Jimmy Jr. that true love exists.  Oh, you're gonna make his day.  Hey, should we call Sergeant Bosco  and let him know we found the pearls?  Nah. I'm sure he's totally forgotten about this case.  BOSCO: Joel Glassman?  Yes?  Sergeant Bosco. Robbery.  Oh, my God! Is this about the birthday checks?  I swear to God I'll stop. I'll rip up the check.  I-I'll give her all the money back!  I Oh, my God!  (yelling)  Stop crying. Stop crying.  I-I'm not crying!  Stop crying. â­I'm not crying!  LIONEL AND DONNY: Bob! Bob!  Bob! Bob! What the hell is that?  (gasps) It's them! Turn off the TV!  Okay, okay, okay. Get on the floor. Get down.  We know you're up there!  We saw you turn off the TV!  LIONEL: Make us a burger!  They won't stop. They're never gonna stop.  (whispers): I'm so scared.  All right, calm down, calm down.  How about this? I'll tell them you died.  Great idea. Thank you. Love you.  He's dead! Go away! He's dead!"

Oh, I think I might be getting diarrhea.  Okay, too honest.  Oh Panic poops.  Oh, my God.  I keep forgetting Gene clogged the employee toilet.  Yeah, he flushed all his old stuffed animals down there.  He's a big boy now. Right. I know.  It's just we should deal with it.  No. He isn't ready.  He visits 'em in there.  Oh, boy. I'll use the restaurant bathroom.    BOB: Aah! Is there something on this toilet seat?!  Uh-oh, Dad!  You just got gooped! â­Ugh.  It was supposed to be for Gene,  but he didn't take his mid-morning bathroom break  for some reason.  I'm on a cheese cleanse!  Physically and spiritually!  Louise, what exactly is this?  It's grease or something.  It was in a jar Teddy left in the basement.  (grunting quietly)  Um, is it possible it's glue?  I don't know.

I don't know.  Lin, just pick one.  You've been doing this for 45 minutes.  You're distracting me.  Now I gotta start over.  Blue, yellow. Blue, yellow.  No, the yellow one goes better with the toilet.  Well, I'm not gonna be on the toilet, right Teddy?  How we doing?  Uh, doing good, Bob. Doing real good.  (quietly): We're not doing good.  Teddy, I can hear you.  No, you can't. The hair dryer's on.  (quietly): This is a disaster.  It's not working, Linda.  The hair dryer is off, Teddy. I can hear every  I can't hear you over the hair dryer, Bobby!  Teddy, it's off.  Turn off the hair dryer!  Oh, I might be getting a little weird from the fumes, Bob.  Are you getting a little weird from the fumes?  What's ""Yappening?""  Dr. Yap's in the bathroom.  Yap? What are you doing here?  I called him, Dad. He's a fixer.  He's gonna get you off of there.  Let's see what's going on down here.  (sighs) Louise, why would you call him?  He's our dentist.  Which is a type of doctor, which is what you need.  And a doctor's a type of dentist.  That is not true.  And dentist comes from the word ""Al dente,""  which means, ""The dent.""  Bob, I work with adhesives and solvents.  I'm exactly the guy you need right now.  There is a very special, harmless dental solvent  that can quickly and painlessly break down the glue  under your tushy.  Really? That's great.  One problem.  I do not currently have any,  but what I could do is get the necessary certifications,  put in an order, and have some delivered  in the next two or three months.  So, should I just go ahead and do that?  I'm a notary, if that helps.  That's your plan? I vouched for you, dentist.  (sighs) We're dead.  We're done. You know, there is another option.  There he is. There's my boy.  What is it? What do you got, Yap?  In the dental game,  you tie a string around a tooth,  and yank it out.  - Oh, my God. - Hear him out.  You are the tooth,  we numb your butt with Novocain,  and we yank you off the toilet.  Done. Dental day-um.  Perfect. This was ringing so I answered it.  It's for Bob.  It's probably Hollywood.  (whispering): Tell them I want Bette Midler  to play me.  Need Bette Midler  to play me. â­Hello?  Bob! It's Skip Marooch.  I'm on an all-terrain vehicle!  I can go on any terrain with this vehicle.  Uh, that's great.  Listen, you know the Coasters guys?  Yeah?  I'm calling because I thought  they were sending Brian,  the nice Hidden Gems guy. Uh-huh.  Which would've been great, but I just found out  they're sending this guy, Newton Fremont.  - Okay. - And  let's just say he's a little tougher.  Like, you know, if he doesn't like you,  you're not getting in the magazine.  But you'll be fine, it'll be fine.  Right.  Could we maybe reschedule with the nice guy  for another day?  That would actually work for me,  'cause today's been, you know, busy.  No, Bob, they're on their way.  That was the whole thing.  They have to come today.  Look, I didn't mean to freak you out.  You'll be great with your face and your funny jokes.  Well, it's just I'm I-I  I'm stuck on a toilet.  (laughs) See? Like that.  So funny. Use that.  No, like I actually got glued to  Bob, I gotta call you back.  I guess water does not count as a terrain.  I'm sinking. Bye.  Teddy, be honest with me. How does it look?  (crying): It's just too much butt, Bob.  Okay. Too much hair all over your butt!  Teddy, stop.  All right, we're doing Yap's plan.  We order the solvent that takes three months?  That didn't sound like a good idea.  No, we tie a rope around me,  and you all yank me off the toilet.  Yes!  I knew there was a reason we brought you into this project.  Ah-Yap-Yap-Yap-Yap-Yap! (chuckles)  All right, let's numb that bum.  Well, the Novocain should be taking effect  right about now.  You feel that? Huh?  You feel that? Gene, stop.  Okay, you ready Bob?  I think so.  Dad, I love you.  Thanks, Tina.  I love you too, Dad.  I love you for real. Not like these posers.  Bobby, I love you! You'll always be my husband.  I love you, Bob.  I'm not dying,  I'm just getting my butt skin ripped off  so I can be in a magazine.  Okay, on the count of three,  we all pull Bob off the toilet.  Quick pro tip: When we start yanking,  ignore the screams.  - One - Oh, my God.  Two, buckle my shoe.  Sorry, couldn't resist. And three!  (all groaning and straining, Bob screaming)  (continues screaming) It's not working!  It's not working!  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!  It's gotta work.  The guys from Coasters are gonna be here any second.  And we're here. The guys from Coasters.  Uh, his eyes are up here.  Doesn't anyone knock anymore?  Um, I don't knock on sheets  'cause they're soft, and they don't make a sound.  I'm Newton Fremont, this is my photographer Cory Battles.  I'm here to shoot you. Ha.  (chuckles) Nice one, Cory. â­Thanks, Newt.  And you must be undiscovered gem  Bob Belcher.  Uh, yeah, that's me.  I'd get up, but I'm, uh, stuck to a toilet.  Yeah. So we hear.  That's what the T-shirts say outside.  They're selling T-shirts?  Do you know if they carry youth large? Gene.  Uh, I got a question:  why are you stuck to a toilet?  Well, uh, it's a kid's prank  gone very wrong.  It was supposed to be Gene.  Whoa. That's a-mazing.  On the day. Of your interview. With Coasters.  This couldn't be worse.  I I, uh  Wait, are you taking pictures?  A.B.C. Always be clicking.  But you aren't gonna use these in the article, right?  What? No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, there's not gonna be any article.  (gasps) No!  But look at his hair.  Wait, don't look at the top.  You can still talk to him.  He's just on the toilet.  Yeah! I do it all the time!  He doesn't expect privacy anymore.  We broke him.  Here's the deal.  We're doing a favor for Brian,  who's doing a favor for Skip,  so we barely care about this.  Plus, we like to profile people  who are unique and inspiring.  You are unique.  You are not inspiring.  At all. â­Yup.  Also, Coasters magazine is primarily read  by people who are sitting on the toilet.  They do not want to read about another guy  who is also sitting on the toilet. Got it.  Plus, why haven't you just taken the seat off?  It doesn't have a seat. â­lt's Swiss.  That makes me sick.  Hey, listen,  this is just a crazy day.  No, no, no, no, no. It's fine.  Actually, you know what? This is perfect.  Lin, this isn't a crazy day.  This is a perfectly average day at Bob's Burgers.  This kind of stuff happens all the time,  and I'm so glad you came by to take it in!  (laughs crazily)  Sorry we couldn't be ""inspiring"" for you!  I guess we just didn't have it in us.  So good-bye!  You can leave!  Thanks for stopping in!  Great outburst, Bob.  Really great outburst.  (mournful music plays)  Excuse me. Comin' through here, guys.  Par excuse me. Pardon us.  Pardon. â­Heads up, guys.  Pardon. Whoa, cool shirt, man.  What is that, marker? Yeah. Permanent.  No! No! Wait! Wait! Don't leave,  I wanna say something.  What my dad said is kind of true.  Yeah, stuff goes wrong all the time.  But this thing today  (sighs) you know it was my fault.  And if I hadn't done this,  my dad would be walking around here right now,  inspiring the crap out of people.  He'd be making burgers really good burgers.  Don't tell him I said that.  We try not to compliment him.  So, yeah, sorry, Dad.  This is all my fault.  BOB: What?  I said it's all my fault!  BOB: Oh. Okay.  TEDDY: Everyone in here should be ashamed of themselves.  Standing around laughing at him.  You see a guy stuck on a toilet  and a shocking amount of body hair.  I see a beautiful toilet man.  A toilet Bob.  (chanting): Toilet Bob! Toilet Bob!  CROWD (chanting): Toilet Bob!  BOB: No. No. Toilet Bob!  Please don't chant that. TEDDY: No, it's in a good way.  Toilet Bob! Toilet Bob!  Come on, everybody! Toilet Bob! Toilet Bob!  BOB: I don't like it.  How about just Bob? (chanting continues)  Just coast on outta here, Coasters.  Toilet Bob!  Toilet Bob! Toilet Bob!  Toilet Bob! Ha, ha!  Toilet Bob!  (Bob screams)  BOB: It worked.  It finally worked!  (cheering)  BOB: I'm free! Yeah!  Whoa. Whoa. Pins and needles.  Can't feel my legs.  Oh, going down.  (cheering)  (bell dinging)  You guys want any of this stuff?  Y-You mean our mail?  Just asking, Bob.  Don't snap at me. â­Look!  It's the latest issue of Coasters!  Linda, we're not in it they were very clear  they weren't gonna write about us,  and I'm more than okay with that.  Oh, you're in it. Oh, my God, we're in it.  What? â­Read it, Dad, read it!  ""Bob's Burgers is more than an undiscovered gem.  ""It's truly a one-of-a-kind mom-and-pop shop.  ""Celebrity chef Skip Marooch swears that Bob's serves  ""the best burger he's ever eaten.  ""We wouldn't know.  ""We didn't try the food.  ""But we did have a rather unique  ""and strangely inspiring experience while we were there.  ""This shabby little dive seems to hold a special spot  in this dingy town's heart.""  Do you think they mean ""dinghy"" town? I don't think there's a  No, that's not a thing dinghy town.  Wow, that was kind of good.  Louise, I-I think you saved the day.  Yeah, well, you know,  this is the last time I'm bailing you out, Dad.  Hey, they didn't even mention the toilet.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, keep reading.  ""Also, Bob got stuck to the toilet."" Oh.  Now turn the page.  Oh, there's a picture  of me on the toilet in Coasters.  ""We could tell you how that happened,  ""but do yourself a favor, visit Bob's Burgers  ""and ask him yourself.  Hopefully, he'll be back on his feet by then.""  So that's pretty good, overall.  Your hair looks good.  Hey! This is the place!  Yeah, this is it. Come on in.  We got business. Kids, grab some menus.  Aah! â­Aah! â­Aah!  We got gooped! Gotcha!  Let's be clear  Bad stuff happens in the bathroom   I did absolutely nothing wrong  â­ I'm just glad   I'm not to blame, it's not my fault  That it happens in a vacuum   Let's just say  Can't let them see me with my pants down   If Gene had pooped like every day  â­ Coasters magazine is gonna be   This would have all just blown away  My big chance now   He'll be out of there in no time   I'll be doing interviews  No one's gonna blame me   And feelin' just fine  I'll be doing just fine   Today is gonna be a great day   I'll do Coasters magazine  If Teddy can't unstick my dad   And blow everyone away  I'll find another way."
"1  (bell on door rings) (stuffed up): Hello, everybody.  Guess who's got two thumbs and the flu?  This gal!  Feel my forehead!  Just feel it! Feel it!  Oh, yeah, you're on fire.  Uh-huh! She's half girl, half grill.  All cop. A really sick cop.  Oh, no, Louise, you caught that flu bug  that's going around? That's terrible.  I know, such bad luck. Ugh.  It's interesting how upbeat you are.  Maybe 'cause you want to miss school?  Father, how dare you.  But, gosh, now that you mention it,  I might have to miss some school.  Man, too bad, I love that stuff.  Mm-hmm. Louise, you do not want that flu bug.  I had it and it gave me weird fever dreams.  I dreamt I was in a book club with my cousin Vanessa,  but she was a werewolf. Classic.  Well, I may have the flu, but I've never felt better.  (sneezes) Gene, celebration hug. No!  Tina All right, I'll take one of those bad boys.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, Tina, no!  (Louise coughs)  How's my little sick pickle?  Wow, that's quite a setup you got going on.  Oh, yeah.  We got my buddy Bakeneko here,  Akkoro Kamui,  Dodomeki and Mizuchi.  I'm just gonna call them all Hello Kitty.  Now let's get you some medicine, huh?  Uppity doodity, bup bup bup bup dit dit!  Right down the hatch. Mmm.  Okay, I'll check on you in a little bit.  (spits)  Like I want to get better.  Hey, wait a minute, who's missing?  Kuchi Kopi. Gah, the Kuch.  He's only my favorite toy in the world.  If I had a favorite.  Which I don't.  (clears throat)  (air horn blares, all scream)  Jeez, I thought we took the air horn away from her.  Did you hide it in your underwear drawer? Yes.  We know about the underwear drawer.  And about your underwear.  Not-so-tighty-not-so-whities. (air horn blares)  Coming!  (air horn blares) Okay, okay, okay.  Oh, good, you heard that. Yeah.  Listen, would you be a lamb and bring me Kuchi Kopi?  I would get him myself, but I'm just so sick and weak.  (fake cough) Sure, where is he?  In the bathroom next to the toilet. Why is he there?  If you must know, mother,  he is my doodie buddy.  Okay.  Well, I'll be right back.  (humming) There he is.  Whoa! Whoa!  (struggling noises) Oh, no.  I dropped Kuchi Kopi in the toilet  and then I tried to rinse him off in the sink  and then I dropped him in the toilet again  and now there's a bunch of water  sloshing around in there.  Oh, Louise won't like that.  Yeah, Mom, that's, like, her favorite thing.  Don't you think I know that, Tina?  Oh, my God, what do we do, what do we do?  Well, we could put rice around it  and put it in the oven.  Yum. No, it might dry it out.  People do it with phones. Hmm.  We should probably throw some ribs in there too.  Just in case. Mm.  Does anyone else feel kind of freezing  and, like, floaty?  (breathes deeply) Just me?  Ugh, where the hell is Kuchi Kopi?  (air horn blares) Just a second. (laughs nervously)  Okay, it's at 100 degrees.  So, how long does this usually take?  30 minutes. 30 minutes?  That's a half an hour.  Louise'll catch onto us before that.  All right, look, I know this oven pretty well. Oven brag.  So, I think if we just turn it to 200 degrees  for a few minutes, it'll do the trick.  (air horn blares) Oh!  I can't go in there by myself.  You guys are coming with me.  What are we gonna tell her? We just got to stall.  I could distract her with an intriguing dance.  Hmm?  Hey, sweetie. Hi. Hi. Hey.  Hi. So, where's Kuchi Kopi?  Right, Kuchi Kopi.  Yes. (Gene sings)  Ooh!  Look at him go.  That's so good.  Wait, Louise, is that your medicine?  Um, no. (gasps) You spit it out?  You're taking that medicine, miss Missy. No, I am not.  Don't you make me do the full family hold down.  You wouldn't dare.  (all grunting and groaning)  How can she be so sick, but still so strong?  Like the economy!  (Louise yells, then Linda yells)  Okay, that's a problem.  Oh, my God, the oven! ALL: Ah!  Oh, my God, the oven to you too, pal!  Oh, no, we left it in too long.  Maybe it'll be fine, though.  It's not fine. I can fix it, I can fix it!  Ow! Hot Kuchi!  Oh, we're dead. We're dead.  Oh, God. We should just leave.  Town.  Get in the car and go far away.  I'd love to see Ann Arbor.  Okay, okay,  uh, she's all loopy right now, right?  Maybe she won't notice?  Hi. Hello. Hi there.  (weakly): You have Kuchi Kopi?  Uh-huh.  There he is. Kuchi.  Okay, good night! Good night.  Phew.  Good night, Kuchi.  (screams) Oh, boy.  (gibberish) It was an accident!  I dropped him in the toilet and then Tina said  we should put him in the oven and then  Bob didn't really know the oven, and then Gene smooshed his face,  so it's all our faults, right guys?  Mm  Louise, we're so sorry.  (angry breathing)  Honey? Say something. Get out.  Louise, I know you're really angry right now,  and it's a little early to, you know,  have some perspective on this and forgive us, but  I will never forgive you for this.  Never ever ever!  How about what if I  (sings)  Get out! Okay, okay!   That went well.  I can't believe this.  I used to trust my family   ALL: We're sorry, so sorry   Now they're just a sham to me   Did we mention that we're sorry?   Destroyed my favorite thing in the world   This wasn't our best day   Broke the heart of this little girl   You can slap us all in the face   No amount of slaps can make this right   Oh, no, that's not good   I guess I'm not the forgiving type.   Whoa, I'm feeling kind of flu-zy.  And the room is kind of woozy.  Was that rug always twirling?  'Cause it makes me feel like hurling.  Whoa!  (yells)  (grunts)    Whoa. Hello.  (both scream back and forth)  Wait, why are you screaming?  I thought that was what we were doing.  Well, let's not. Okeydokey.  LOUISE: So I'm gonna go out on a limb  and say I may be having a fever dream.  It's sort of gloomy.  Is that 'cause I'm, I don't know,  mad at my family?  Is that how fever dreams work?  Hey, I say just have fun with it.  Jeez. I got to tell you, Kuch,  it's kind of hard to look at you.  Is it bad? It's bad.  Not in the face, though, right?  Man, my family did a number on you.  We should kill them. Whoa, what?  Too much? Hey, I just remembered.  I have a place here. A time share.  You have a time share in my fever dream?  Yes, it's a beautiful fortress. There!  You can just see it. Oh, yeah.  Are you looking where I'm pointing?  Yeah, it's, like, the only fortress.  Right, but you're not reacting like,  ""Whoa, that's an incredible fortress.""  It's very nice, it's very nice.  Anyway  we should totally go there.  We can be alone, and  (whispers): we'll be safe there.  Safe from what?  Safe from everyone.  No one will hurt us!  Whoa. Sorry.  Yeah. Okay, well, um,  yeah, let's get going.  Sounds good.  LINDA: Oh, this is awful!  Yeah, Louise hates us!  I mean, probably me the least, but yeah.  (phone rings) Hello?  Hey, Bob, it's Teddy. From the restaurant.  Are you watching this hockey game right now?  No, Teddy. Ah, well, I wish you were  'cause my cable's out, I want to come over and watch it.  Look, I-it's not really a good time.  We're in the middle of a crisis here.  We kind of melted Louise's Kuchi Kopi night light.  But that's, like, her favorite thing. We know, Teddy.  Wait, Kuchi Kopi, that's made out of vinyl, right?  I don't know, I guess.  Well, why don't I bring over my heat gun  and we try to fix it? You have a heat gun?  Yeah, I use it to weld PVC pipe for plumbing.  I've definitely told you about it.  Makes me feel like you don't listen to me, Bob. Uh-huh.  Anyway, we can use it to mold Kuchi Kopi  back to his former self.  Also, maybe if you see the heat gun, you'll remember it  the next time I bring it up in conversation.  All right, we're desperate, so come on over.  Maybe we can put the hockey game on in the background. Bye, Teddy.  Teddy's coming over and he's bringing his heat gun.  Is that a euphemism for his ding dong?  It's got an open floor plan,  stainless steal appliances.  It's just a really great fortress  to go to to get away from it all. (rustling)  Shh. I think I heard something.  Don't tell me shush.  (Bob's voice): Halt down there!  You shall not whoa! Ow!  Oh  (clears throat) Uh, you shall not pass.  Bakeneko? What's going on?  Louise, I cannot allow you to get to the fortress. What? Why not?  (whispers): He's so jealous he's not invited to the fortress.  It's pathetic.  Because the fortress is an awful place.  I mean, who builds a fortress that blocks the sun  and makes everything dark and gloomy?  Who does that?  Probably a cool dude.  That fortress is the worstest   And I think it's kind of cursed us   You can see it has immersed us   In this darkness  Wow.  I built a beautiful   (falsetto):  Sun deck   Up there in the trees   (normal): You could bring a good   (falsetto):  Book there   And feel the gentle breeze   (normal):  It had a lovely   (falsetto): View of the vicinity   (normal):  But then they built that fortress there   And ruined it for me.   Kill him. What now?  Well, ho-hold on.  Look, Bakeneko,  you don't tell me where I can and can't go  in my own fever dream.  Why do you want to go there anyway?  Well if you must know, to be alone.  Pfft. That's dumb. You're dumb.  Your face is dumb.  (quietly): My face is not dumb.  Beat the bear. Bup bup bup bup bup bup.  (chuckles) I really don't want to fight you.  Ah, then let us pass. Okay, I'll fight you.  But I'll go easy on you because I'm so big and  (Lousie grunts, Bakeneko groans, then wheezes) Okay, not bad.  All you have (grunting)  to do is let us pass!  (high-pitched grunting): I'm not trying my hardest.  Ha! Just so you know  (yells)  Oh!  Oh, okay, taking a quick break.  Or you can just keep walking. That's fine.  (mumbling) TEDDY: Sheesh. It really looks messed up.  You sure you don't just want to replace it?  I know a toy guy.  I mean, he's real. He's not a toy.  No, no, no, no, no, no, Teddy, You could probably get  she loves this thing, maybe more than us.  Let's just try and fix it before she wakes up.  Linda, you got the mustard for the switch out?  Yes, mustard, check, right here. This is full.  Is this even the same weight as Kuchi Kopi?  Let me see it.  (eating sounds) Now it is.  Thanks, Gene. You're welcome.  (Tina groans nervously)  (all gasp, Louise stirs)  (all sigh in relief)  How about putting on that hockey game, Bobby?  If we keep it low?  That was so badass, Louise.  You were like, ""Oh, I shall not pass?  Well, then why am I passing?"" (chuckles)  You hear that, everyone that may or may not  be in the swamp right now?  You don't want to mess with this girl.  No sir!  (both yell, creature growls)  (nervous chuckle) Hello, pretty swamp monster.  You didn't hear all that super cool trash talk  I said before, did you?  (growling) (screaming): Okay, I guess you did!  (Akkoro Kamui growling) Akkoro Kamui? Is that you?  (clearing throat) Yeah.  (coughing) Yeah.  (Linda's voice): Uh, yes, it's me. Hi.  LOUISE: Hi.  So, listen, none shall pass.  Gas. (makes fart noise) Just kidding.  But yeah, n-none shall pass. No. (laughs nervously)  I can't let you get to that fortress, Louise.  It's a bad, bad place.  Allow me to explain. Here we go.  That fortress is the worstest   And it's really kind of cursed us   You can see it has immersed us in this darkness   Yup. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  I threw the best swamp parties   I'd serve wine and calamaris   And we'd drink and drink and drink and drink and   Yup, got it, we got it.  Hold on, I'm not done.  And we drink and drink and drink and   Come on, everybody! Drink and drink and drink   And drink and drink  A little repetitive?  And drink and drink all day!   But then the fortress made it dark and cold   And that is not okay!  Yeah!  Um, Kuch? Quick side bar? Sure.  (whispering): What's what's up?  (whispering): Everyone's got, like,  a major problem with me going to this fortress.  What? No they don't.  Well, I'm just saying, maybe there's something about it  that I'm not figuring out, or like it's a metaphor.  Well, maybe we get to the fortress  and figure it out while we're sitting in the Jacuzzi  with eight jet streams, hm?  Yeah, okay, fine.  (whispering): What are we whispering about?  Oh, hey Akkoro Kamui,  come here, I want to tell you something.  Okay.  Closer.  Okay. Ha!  Ow, my face!  What Louise? Where'd you go?  Whatcha doin'?  Wha? Wha?  So long, Akkoro P.U.-y!  High five. Ah, nuts.  Hey, kind of like a ponytail.  (dryer whirring, stops)  Okay done.  TINA: Huh. You gave him boobs.  Boobs? Those are his arms.  Mmm  Look, this thing works much better on PVC pipe.  Any chance Louise would want  two pieces of PVC pipe welded together?  (sighing): Look, it's all right, Teddy.  Y-You tried.  Well, may I suggest going back to the plan  where you just replace it?  The toy guy's over on Hillcrest.  Bob, that is right by the all-night pharmacy.  And we need more medicine,  since some tricky little sicky  knocked it out of my hand.  Won't this toy store be closed?  He'll open up for an emergency. How do you know that?  You know when you wake up in the middle of the night,  and all you want is to look over  and see your little Mumaluma doll  that you suddenly remember from your childhood?  N uh, no. And you call around looking,  'cause you just want to pull the little string  and hear that little guy say, ""Mumaluma, Mumaluma.""  Mm. No? Nobody?  No. ""Mumaluma.""  No. ""Mumaluma.""  No one knows ""Mumaluma.""  Sorry. Stop saying that! Mumaluma!  No? Nothing? Not ringing a bell.  No. Sorry.  Anyway, finally, an angel answers your call,  and he's willing to open up his shop after hours for you.  That angel is Clyde.  Wait, what's the toy say again?  Mumaluma! No no no no no!  Man, I am so sick of my toys trying to stop me  from going where I want to go.  Let's face it. Everybody stinks.  Except me. I'm great. Hey, look.  We are close. LOUISE: Finally!  Ugh, I just want to get there, put up my feet  (engines revving) and oh, come on!  (Gene's voice): Hello. (Tina's voice): Hi.  Dodomeki, Mizuchi, don't you dare!  What? Don't say ""you shall not pass""!  Uh, well then this will be awkward.  'Cause you shall not pass.

The time share people double-booked us.  LOUISE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  If you're Good Kuchi Kopi,  then what does that make him?  I mean, I don't really want to say.  Let's just say I'm good Kuchi Kopi.  No no no no, he calls himself Good Kuchi Kopi.  It doesn't make him good.  I could call myself six-pack Kuchi Kopi,  it doesn't make me have muscles!  Yeah, you're looking good, by the way.  That is just so jerky of you.  You're Jerky Kuchi Kopi.  You are. You are!  You are. You are. You! You!  You are. You are!  What the hell is going on here?!  BOB: Wow, I had no idea how great Kuchi Kopi is.  TEDDY: He's amazing.  It's so cool how he's, like, a spirit  that can be different things to different people.  Like Tom Brady.  Clyde actually did a really good job reading.  Yeah, he nailed the Frog King. Oh, my God,  the Frog King was good. Yeah, right? Huh?  That's very good.  Okay, so, what are you doing here,  ""Good Kuchi Kopi""?  Besides killing the vibe.  You don't get it yet, do you Louise?  What this place is?  Why we've all been trying to stop you from getting here?  No, I don't. But you can keep on  being mysterious about it, if you want.  Closing yourself off like this, Louise?  Hm? Building angry walls around yourself, Louise?  You need to forgive your family.  What? Oh, that's what this is all about?  Well, the answer is no!  Okay? I mean, look what they did.  Look at his face. He's hideous.  Okay, that's not necessary.  Forgiving your family would be good for you, Louise.  Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Not gonna do it.  You think living behind these walls   Stop it. No, I won't stop it.  The end. Great song. No, it's not the end.  Means you can't get hurt at all   (scoffs) This guy.  Huh, am I right?  Shush. Be quiet.  But that just makes it dark outside   Blah, blah, blah is what I'm hearing.  And only you can bring in the light   Okay, how long is this going to go on?  There's just one thing that will make this right   Push that button   Push that button   Become the forgiving type.   I don't remember that being there.  What kind of contractors  would put in a ""destroy fortress"" button?  It was a backup plan.  And also, I thought the place  needed something button-ish  right around here, someplace.  Louise? No.  No, no, no.  Don't push the button, Louise.  Louise, no! Don't push the button!  Oh, crap.  (rumbling)  Oh!  Oh!  ALL: Ah!  Oh!  ALL: Ah! Jeez  I just had the weirdest dream.  Wait a second.  W-Why does he look like that?  Why does anyone look like anything?  Look at Dad. What's up with that?  No, I mean, I thought you guys melted Kuchi Kopi.  Was that just part of my dream?  Uh-huh. That's it. Yeah. Yep.  Uh, Mom, why are you holding mustard?  Uh, 'cause I love it.  (gurgling) She gets it.  Huh. Dad, what's behind your back?  What? This is just how I stand.  Isn't this how I stand?  Yeah, like a matador.  Yup. He's our Dad-ador!  Aye, buddy? (slapping)  Oops. BOB: Uh-oh.  Huh. So it did happen.  We're so sorry, Louise.  We're a bunch of sorry sons of bitches.  Gene. Sorry.  Anyway, you don't  have to say anything. We just want  I forgive you.  Wa-Wait, wha, wha?  I said I forgive you guys.  Oh, boy. She's still pretty sick.  No, I mean it. I forgive you.  Phew. Oh Oh, good.  Hey, when did old Kuchi Kopi get boobs?  I mean, I knew this day would come, but not so soon.  Teddy did it.  Well, I forgive him, too.  Wow, you're a forgiving machine, Louise.  I am. Come on, give me something else to forgive!  Gene, Tina! Go!  Okay, uh  Ugh. Oh, Gene!  That is unforgivable.  It wasn't Gene.  (chuckling): Wow, Tina. I'm impressed.  LINDA: All right, Bob, give her the medicine. BOB: Oh, crap, the medicine.  I'm dreaming of a world   Where you forgive your family   You seem like a girl   That would choose Good Kuchi Kopi   Over Bad Kuchi Kopi   That flu bug took you on a trip   A crazy tough ride   But the sickness made you better   And I'm glad you didn't die"
"1  TINA: Um  Is it mustard? â­Uh, ketchup.  We were looking for ketchup. â­Oh.  Kids, stop playing ""What is it?""  What do you expect us to do, work?  Yes. â­No.  Hello, Belchers. Hey, Teddy.  Question.  What are you all doing tomorrow?  I'm gonna be straight collagin'.  Why do you ask?  You know that boat that I've been fixing up?  You've mentioned it.  Well, I finally got her shipshape,  and I thought it'd be fun to take you all out.  Kill us?  No, take you out for a boat ride.  Tomorrow.  Ooh, family boat trip.  That sounds great, Teddy, if we can get back  in time for the lunch rush. Absolutely.  So I'll put you down for a soft ""maybe.""  Huh? No, no, no, we're in.  Great. Well, just let me know for sure,  because I got to plan for drinks and stuff like that.  Teddy, we're coming. We-we said yes. â­Mm-hmm.  Okay, so hopefully you'll be there.  I got to go, I got to go.  That's a mean joke to play on your friend, Dad.  What? We're going. â­Oh.  LINDA:  We're going sailing   On a motorboat   Do-do-do-do   Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do   So, Dad, you're probably wondering why I'm holding  this chalkboard eraser from the restaurant.  What? Wait.  Why are you holding the eraser from the restaurant?  I'm glad you asked.  You see, we've had some discussions  about me having my own cell phone,  haven't we, Father? â­Uh-huh.  Some people say I shouldn't have my own cell phone,  because I lose things sometimes.  That people is me,  because you lose things sometimes, all the time.  Well, agree to disagree.  Hmm, no.  Has anyone seen my other shoe?  Has anyone seen a burger on a plate?  Has anyone seen my toothbrush?  It was in my mouth a second ago.  Okay, so maybe I lose things sometimes.  But I wouldn't lose a reasonably-priced cell phone  with a sensible data package.  And I'm going to prove it  by not losing this eraser all day.  Tina, I like that eraser.  I'm gonna miss it.  Yeah, it was a good eraser.  Rest in peace.  Guys, I'm not going to lose it.  Oh, my God, where is it?  LOUISE: You just dropped it.  Didn't lose it. Not lost.  Ahoy, Belchers.  LINDA: Wow, look at you.  In a shirt, on a boat.  Hoity-toity. â­Yeah.  Teddy, the boat looks amazing.  Thanks, it was just an outhouse  for seagulls when I got it.  Just a floating bucket.  Welcome aboard the Sea Me Now.  So I tricked out everything, as you can see.  Custom drink holders all over the place.  I weatherproofed a couple of loungers.  Secured some additional seating.  Go ahead, try it out.  Super comfy.  So comfy.  Are these from France?  Maybe.  And this here's mission control.  (whistles)  Wait, it that the steering wheel from your truck?  It sure is. Hey, what do I need  two steering wheels for?  I can't be two places at once, right?  Also, I popped by the store.  I got some nibbles.  Hello. â­Help yourself.  Oh, cheese and crackers, just like on land. â­Yeah.  What do you say? Should we get this boat on the road?  Toot-toot.  Yay. â­Boat on the road. Toot-toot.  We can go anywhere; where do you want to go?  Probably Mars. Sacramento?  Wherever Captain Phillips happened?  Uh, bup, bup, bup, bup.  Oh, here's someplace we could go.  You know how my ex-wife Denise left me  for some guy that's into boats?  Well, he owns a bar on the docks  on Menemshewena Island.  Denise works there, too.  We could swing by there  in this really cool boat I have now.  That might be fun, right?  I mean, right? That might be fun.  Now that I think about it for the first time, right?  Uh â­Yikes.  Whoa.  Just an idea. â­Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Spitballing.  Seems like maybe this isn't  the first time you've thought about it?  Yeah, I was picking up on that, too.  Huh? What do you mean?  Your ex-wife left you  for a boat guy.  Yeah. And you've been  fixing up a boat for, like, years and years,  ever since your divorce.  Yeah, and?  You actually called your boat Sea Me Now?  I don't, uh, I don't get where you're going with this, Bob.  It's a nautical pun.  Teddy, is this whole day all about Denise?  Maybe you shouldn't try and impress her.  (laughing): Impress her? Denise?  What? Huh? That's crazy.  We have both moved on.  Also, didn't she treat you horribly?  Didn't she say the back of your head looks like a butt?  Yes, and that's why I wear a hat.  And didn't she make you go to the bathroom in the yard?  I was not doing a great job with  Yeah, and then I started to enjoy it.  And didn't she cheat on you, like, a lot?  Yes, but I was working seven, eight hours a day,  five days a week sometimes.  O-Of course she cheated on me  all over the place.  I left her no choice, Bobby. Uh-huh.  Sure. No, yeah. Right.  Great. It's settled.  Setting a course for my ex-wife's  boyfriend's waterfront bar.  Okay, we're getting close.  That's the bar that, uh, her boyfriend owns.  The Schoon Hound.  Classy.  TEDDY: There's Denise.  Oh, my God, oh, my God.  Oh, my God, oh, my God. Teddy, Teddy, rel  Oh â­Relax.  Oh, my God, okay, here we go.  Big smiles, everyone.  Hold your plates up.  You're having a great time.  And here we go.  (laughing) Great joke.  And did everyone get enough expensive fruit salad?  Oh, hey, Denise.  Crap. (growls) No.  She didn't see us.  Well, if at first you don't succeed  Oh, boy.  Just got to bring her around.  We're going starboard here, everyone, or port, or something.  Okay, here we go.  Teddy, you really want to try again? Damn right I do.  Geez, kind of a wide turn, huh, Teddy?  Yeah, it's not a ten-speed bike, Bob.  Let me see you rebuild a boat.  BOB: Sorry, Teddy, sorry.  TEDDY: I got it, I got it, I got it.  Okay, there she is.  I think she can see us.  Here we go.  (heavy breathing)  (laughing)  (laughing): Great joke, okay, huh?  Did everyone get enough expensive fruit salad?  LINDA: We did. It's delicious.  LOUISE: It tastes like success.  Nope. (growls)  Not that time, either. Why would she see me?  I'm only in a huge boat, yelling her name.  Who likes U-turns?  Everyone like U-turns?  GENE: I'm learning to appreciate them.  We're doing a U-turn!  Right full rudder.  I'm going to bring her around starboard.  No, port! (groans and growls)  Uh, how you doing, buddy?  Uh, uh, I'm doing wonderful.  I mean, we're on the ocean.  We're enjoying the ocean, Bobby.  Will you please sit down? Yeah, okay.  Smiles, everyone.  We're doing great since the divorce.  Hey, fruit salad.  I mean, Denise.  I mean, look at my boat.  I'm inside of a boat.  It's I mean, it's my boat.  Teddy?  Huh? Hey.  Hi.  Denise, when did you start  waitressing at your boyfriend's place?  I mean, is that where your boyfriend owns that?  ALL: Aah!  (gasping)  So, uh, good catching up.  This fruit salad oh, my God, the best.  Oh, God. â­Oh, boy.  Do you think that Denise noticed that I crashed the boat?  What? No.  Uh, I'm not Teddy, by the way.  (creaking)  That doesn't sound good.  Crap, we're still stuck.  I-I'm going to give it all she's got.  (engine revving)  (Teddy growling)  (cracking)  We're free!  (grunting) â­Crap.  BOB: Oh, boy.  LOUISE: And that's how you  make an exit, people.  Great job, Teddy.  There is blowing it, and there is blowing it.  What? It was fine.  ALL: Mm-hmm.  Not too many people  were taking videos with their phones.  I pretended to take one, but don't worry,  I won't post it anywhere.  (groaning)  Not how I imagined this going.  Me and my stupid butt-head. (growls)  Let's get you home.  Maybe by tomorrow, or next Christmas,  you can laugh about the whole thing.  Teddy, Linda's right.  All of this is probably for the best, so, uh  smooth sailing from here.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh, does that smoke look extra smoky to you guys?  I mean,  it doesn't look great coming from a motor.  That smoke is coming from the motor?  I thought we were slow-roasting ribs.  Oh, whoa, yeesh.  That dock sure did a number on us.  Teddy, when's a good time to tell you  there's water coming into the boat?  Is now a good time, or should I?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not ideal.  TINA: Not an ideal time? Okay, I'll tell you later.  Are we sinking?  Uh I mean, yes, but  But, but, but wa-wa-wait, we can make it home, right?  I mean, we're going to be fine, of course, no.  But just to be safe, we should probably radio the Coast Guard,  and everyone put on life vests.  Come on, kids, do it 'cause it's fun.  Oh, my God.  TEDDY: Okay, we just got to turn it  to channel 16.  Where's the thing that I talk into?  Wha-What do you mean? The thing that you press.  Wait, it's not there?  Oh, boy. Oh.  What, Teddy?  You know that little mic thing that you're supposed  to plug in right here? Yeah.  Well, the good news is, it was perfect  for my policeman costume for Halloween.  The bad news is, we don't have a working radio.  Are you serious?  I took part of it to make  I was third. I won third.  You took the part that we need to talk into right now,  'cause we're sinking.  And now my phone's not getting a signal.  Me, either. â­Nothing.  Wait, so we can't call for help?  Well, there is a flare gun.  Every boat should have one of these,  but that's for, like, a real emergency.  Yeah, let's all keep our eyes peeled for a real emergency.  Hmm, right. I see what you're saying.  Well, we've got one flare,  so this has to be the perfect shot.  (gunshot) (splashing)  Huh.  Maybe a fish will swim for help.  Now what, Teddy?  Now what do we do?  Okay, calm down, Bob.  Why? Wh-Why should I calm down?  Can I talk to you over here for a sec?  Teddy messed up, all right, he did.  But blowing your top at him  isn't going to help anything.  We don't know that, Lin, it might.  Look, just don't go nuts on the poor guy.  Fine, we'll just calmly sink to the bottom of the ocean.  Okay, everybody.  I might be partially to blame  for some stuff today, but I've got a plan.  I think we can make it to this little island right here.  The map says it's a private island.  You know, it could be Caffery's Island.  Mr. Caffery of Caffery's Taffy?  And Caffery's bootlegged liquor?  I think we could all use a drink, right?  Yeah, I could use a cordial.  I think one of these little islands was his, or still is.  I mean, rich people can own stuff  even after they're dead, right?  Dead raccoons act like they own the road.  TEDDY: Is there a dock?  I'm not seeing a dock.  (metal crunching) What was that?  You hit a rock. A-A couple of rocks.  Uh, they had it coming.  Yeah, why not? Why not hit a couple of rocks?  (Teddy growling)  I think this is as far as we're going here.  We can't get any closer to shore.  (Teddy groans)  All right, I guess we're getting wet.  It's okay.  It's just like at the mall.  Sometimes you got to park far away and hoof it.  Dropping anchor.  Still got my eraser phone, Dad.  And I'm not letting it get wet.  That's great, Tina.  It's super important right now.  Tell me about it.  Oh, land!  You sweet son of a bitch, get over here.  (kissing)  LINDA (reading):  Oh, that's not good.  You'd think if you had a private island,  you could afford to get rid of the danger.  Maybe it's luxury danger.  (in French accent): Dangier.  Well, we don't have a choice.  We have to find help.  Look, on top of the hill.  There's a house.  Good eye, Louise.  Eh, I can notice things, too.  Look, there's an eraser on the ground.  Damn it.  Wait. Starting up.  Phew. It still works.  (growling) Shh.  Did you guys hear something?  Do you mean ever, or just now?  TINA: I didn't hear any thing.  What the?  (growling) (screaming)  Cows! Tell them we don't sell hamburgers.  Tell them we don't sell hamburgers.  Oh, no, oh, God. â­What do we do? What do we do?  Uh, they keep moving closer.  They look so mad. What's their problem?  And why are they so hairy?  Get a haircut and a job, you hippies.  How'd you get out of Burlington, Vermont?  Okay, everyone walk slowly to the right,  and maybe don't look them in the eyes.  All right.  Looking at my feet, very casual.  (singing)  TEDDY: They're still coming.  Th-They're not stopping. BOB: Oh, no.  I don't like their attitude right now.  LINDA: Yeah, they are mad at us.  Why are they mad at us?  I think we should run. I think we should, uh,  run toward those rocks.  Good plan. â­Uh, uh, uh,  I'm pretty sure cattle can't climb rocks, right?  And go, go, go, go, go.  LINDA: Oh, no, oh, no, getting cut off.  We're gonna go to those rocks.  Okay, uh, we'll keep going to these rocks!  (lowing)  (groaning)  LINDA: We made it.  Climb up towards the house.  We'll meet you there.  I think we'll be okay if we stay off the grass.  Yeah, get off my lawn.  TEDDY: Uh, I can't believe I got us in this mess.  Sea Me Now is right.  See me bring a bunch of kids  to an island with deadly cattle.  Not the day I pictured.  Not how it looked on my vision board,  and not how I saw it going down with Denise.  But maybe it wasn't the best plan, I mean.  What were you even going to say to Denise?  If you didn't crash the boat so loudly?  Uh, I guess I was going to say something like,  ""Ahoy, Denise.""  Uh  Uh-huh, and then what?  That's all I had.  Ugh, I'm useless.  Aw, well, maybe it would make you feel better  if we do some role-playing,  and, uh, we pretend it went great.  And I'll be Denise, and you be you.  Okay.  And I'll be Denise's boyfriend.  Proud owner of The Schoon Hound.  Uh, ahoy, Denise.  Uh, did you, did you see my boat?  Ahoy to you, Teddy.  Wow, look at your boat.  It's just beautiful.  TINA: Yeah, I'm super jealous.  And that woman with you,  the one with the glasses, she looks fun.  Is she your girlfriend?  What? Who, Linda?  No, she's a friend. She's-she's Bob's wife.  Hi, you. I'm Denise.  I'm Linda.  Linda, I love that name.  You look so smart.  And who's that cool teen with the barrette?  I assume she's got her own cell phone.  Uh, I think you guys are getting a little off track.  Right, right, right.  Teddy, you look great.  Leaving you for this idiot  was the dumbest thing I ever did.  Really? â­Absolutely.  She's right.  You should be with Denise, not me.  I've got The Schoon Hound, I'll be fine.  Come on, let's give love a second chance.  What do you say?  I say, ""Let's do it.""  Let's get back together.  I'm going to fix up my boat again.  And then we'll fix up our marriage.  End scene.  Oh, my God, I'm crying. I just got chills.  Can we do one where you say,  ""It looks like you lost ten pounds""?  How long should we wait for him?  Is he dead?  Wait for who?  I forget who was behind us.  (panting): That wasn't, uh  so so tough. (groans)  Here we are.  Good news, everybody.  We did our role-playing game,  and we came to the conclusion  that as soon as we get off the island,  Denise and I are going to get back together.  What are you talking about? What is he talking about?  Um, it sounds worse when he says it.  Uh, you weren't there, Bob.  I was there. I played that no-good  son of a bitch boyfriend of hers.  Oh, my God.  Hey, look at us.  Almost to the house on the hill.  GENE: They'd better have cable and kettle corn.  Oh, no, no, no.  We're supposed to go over that?  Are you kidding me?  I'll go, and if I make it across,  I'll call for help.  (boards creaking)  That was a super creak. (Tina moaning)  It's super creaky, yow!  I don't know, Teddy.  It seems like that bridge  might completely fall apart.  It might,  but that's a risk I got to take.  Okay, good luck.  You guys wait here.  I was born to be on Team Wait Here.  Okay, here I go.  (boards creaking)  Making progress.  Careful, Teddy.  Wait till Denise hears about this.  This is going to make one very impressive story.  If I don't make it, tell her I died a hero.  So you'll be dead, but you still want to impress her.  And kind of, uh, embellish it a little.  You know,  maybe I did a cool flip  like a diver or something.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, we'll, we'll tell her. â­Okay.  (boards creaking)  Boy, this, uh, bridge does not feel sturdy.  Guys? Guys?  Guys, behind you.  (lowing) (screaming)  Everybody over the bridge.  Go, go, go!  LINDA: Easy, easy.  GENE: I'm glad this is easy for you,  but I'm freaking out!  LOUISE: Careful, careful, careful, okay.  Okay, the cows are smarter than we are.  They're not getting on this bridge.  BOB: Just keep moving  and try not to be heavy, everybody.  Hey, I skipped brunch today.  No, I didn't.  Okay, step by step.  Easy does it.  (screaming)  ALL: Tina!  Let the eraser go.  Y-You need both hands.  But I haven't lost it this whole time.  I'm not about to let go of it now.  You can have a phone, all right?  Just grab on to the rail.  Oh, okay, cool.  That was a great eraser.  One of the best.  Terrible reception, though.  (all groaning)  BOB: Ugh. â­LINDA: We made it.  Oh, my babies.  (grunting)  Who are you? â­(screaming)  What are you doing here?  Just kicking it.  W-We're not here on purpose.  Get out of here. This is private property.  We know, it's Caffery's Island.  Yes, and it's my job to protect it.  So get off this island.  We'd love to, sir, but we're stranded here  and we just want to use your phone.  Also, please don't weed-whack us.  I might if you don't skedaddle.  Imagine this is your shins.  No, we-we get it.  Just listen,  Teddy's boat is all busted and crashed on the rocks out there.  I'm Teddy.  The guy with the boat that he was just talking about.  Right. So can we borrow your phone to call for help?  All right, I won't whack you. Come on in.  I'll give you a tour and I'll see if I have any of my  trespasser's punch.  Ooh, punch!  And this is the parlor.  So, uh, is this where the phone is?  We'll get there eventually.  I'm just guessing, but is it just you out here  by yourself, Nathaniel?  Oh, yeah.  Just me and my gardening tools and the cattle.  Yeah, you could put that down at any time.  No, thanks.  And why are there terrifying cattle  running wild on this island?  Those are Highland longhorns.  Mr. Caffery imported them all the way from Scotland.  They were a gift to the love of his life, Gwendolyn.  She was Scottish! TINA: Aw.  NATHANIEL: But she did not return his affections.  TINA: Oh.  Hell, he bought this island for her.  For Gwendolyn, the Scot!  Yup. And he named it How-Boutcha-Love-Me Island.  And he built this house for her.  Which he named  ""the house that Caffery built for Gwendolyn.""  That man had all the money in the world,  but he couldn't get the woman he loved to love him back.  She left him for an Austrian count named Lipshitz.  And the cattle have overrun this island ever since.  Wait, Teddy, you're just like Caffery.  I am? â­Yes.  Caffery did all this stuff to impress this Gwendolyn lady.  Uh-huh. â­It's just like you with your boat.  You're right.  Yes! Finally!  I could buy an island!  For Denise. That'll help me win her back.  Oh, my God! â­What?  Teddy! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! â­(groaning)  LINDA: Bob, Bob, Bob!  Teddy, I think what Bob is trying to say  is that you should forget about Denise.  And forget about our fun and creative role-playing,  which maybe was not so helpful.  I'm still proud of the work I did.  You don't have to let Denise know you're doing all right.  You can just do all right.  And you are all right, all right?  If you would just stop it. â­Ah!  Okay, okay, okay, Bobby, let him go.  Or shake him more?  Or give him a raspberry on his belly.  That'll teach him.  It's just, we love you, Teddy.  We want the best for you.  NATHANIEL: Wow, look at you people.  Listen, I don't offer this to most trespassers,  but you folks seem odd.  Okay  You don't need to use the phone.  I got a boat and a lot of time.  I could tow you home.  You-you have a boat?  Yes. Got a couple.  In the boathouse.  Boathouse? We didn't see a boathouse.  'Cause you came up on the wrong side of the island.  The front of the property's beautiful.  Have a look.  That's the place to trespass.  Oh, yeah, that's good trespassing.  Next time maybe.  NATHANIEL: Geez,  you dinged it up pretty good.  Nobody light a match or flick your butts over this way.  You're leaking diesel all over the place.  Did he say ""flick your butts?""  Excuse me, where can we flick our butts?  'Cause that needs to happen pretty soon.  Dad, I wanted to say thank you for thinking  I'm responsible enough for my own cell phone.  Which we both agree I am.  Yes, Tina. You'll be a great  cell phone owner.  I know. I will. Someday.  But I don't want my own cell phone right now.  You don't?  No, I couldn't take my eyes  off the eraser the whole day.  And if you're always looking down,  then you're missing what's around you.  What's around you.  Oh. Okay, Tina. I guess that's great.  Cheaper, too. And I think you should read more, Dad.  I feel like I've never seen you read a book.  Okay. That's enough, Tina.  And have you ever sat down and talked to Mom,  just really talked?  Huh. â­Mm.  Dad, no more screen time for you.  We're gonna have to take your phone away.  Yup.  That's that.  Oh! â­Whoa. â­Whoa.  Ooh, that's a fire!  Teddy! Did you do that?  I did. You were right, Bob.  Okay, but I mean, I didn't say set it on fire.  Tell you the truth, I never even liked boats.  Eh, you know who likes boats?  Guys that are trying to impress their exes, that's who.  Not me. â­I like boats.  Should we be towing that still?  I mean maybe we cut her loose?  'Cause it's on fire? Cuttin' her loose!  Teddy, you could've sold that boat  for parts or something, right?  Or, I mean, I would have taken a free boat.  Just saying.  Nah, a fresh start is good.  Time for me to live my life for me.  I'm pretty sure all of our wallets and stuff were on there.  Oh, yeah? Huh.  So a fresh start for all of us then, huh?  (explosion)  Eh. Oh.  Guess the steering wheel from my truck's on there, too.  Can I get a ride home with you guys?  BOB: Oh, God.  TEDDY: Eh. The way home's mostly straight.  I'll probably make it.  Somewhere beyond the sea   Somewhere waitin' for me   My lover stands on golden sands   And watches the ships   That go sailin'   Somewhere   Beyond the sea   She's there watching for me   If I could fly like birds on high"
"1  Four days till Halloween.  So five days till I'm feeling dandy and pooping candy.  I don't know what my costume's gonna be,  but I do know it'll be last minute and Mom will make it.  I think I have a pretty great idea for a costume.  (singsongy): Maybe even great enough  to win the costume contest.  Oh, yeah, the costume contest.  I'm disqualified because of last year.  And next we have Louise Belcher dressed as,  ah, Phillip Frond.  (imitating Mr. Frond): I'm a guidance counselor.  Council, council, council, council. â­No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Safe to cross.  I don't do costume contests.  The only contests I do start with  either ""Miss"" or ""Pie Eating.""  I'm gonna be a hot mess.  I'm gonna dress really messy  and then decorate myself in flames.  Ooh, Tina, that's a good idea.  Yeah. Wait, you're gonna be a hot mess?  Because I'm actually gonna be a hot mess.  Wait, I thought we were gonna be sexy Judge Judys?  No, Jocelyn, I'm gonna be a hot mess.  Tammy, are you saying that because you just  heard me say it and like the idea?  No, I like the idea because it's mine now.  I mean, it was always mine. Always. I always had it.  She's got you there, T.  Back on the sidewalk.  Wait, Tammy! â­See ya later!  I'm gonna sign up for the costume contest right now.  My hot mess idea is totally gonna win.  It's my idea!  I need to cross the street.  Not safe.  Jackie, please, let me cross!  Tammy's stealing my costume idea!  Not safe.  But there are no cars coming, look!  Now I'm not letting you cross  because you're getting on my nerves.  (groans)  Thanks a lot, Jackie. Thank you.  I can see two things coming from a mile away:  cars and sarcasm.  Crossing guard burn.  All right, guys.  Here it is. â­Wow.  Ooh, I love it! My little Bobbleangelo.  It's a perfect burger.  Yeah. I used a stencil.  Oh. â­Okay. Slightly less impressed.  It's clever though, right? We're a burger restaurant.  It's advertising.  I wouldn't say ""clever.""  I'm gonna go put this outside. â­Outside?  Why don't you put it on the counter for decoration?  No, jack-o'-lanterns go outside.  That's what people do with jack-o'-lanterns.  But what if some kid smashes it or eggs it or something?  I'll bring it in tonight, when we close up.  When I was a kid, squirrels used to eat our jack-o'-lanterns. Aw.  And then one year my dad sat in the bushes with a BB gun  and he waited for the squirrels to come.  Oh. â­Huh. â­Eh. Well, it wasn't BBs that got 'em.  He also poisoned the pumpkins.  That was, uh, not my favorite Halloween.  (Tina groaning)  I can't believe Tammy stole my costume.  I can't believe that you can't believe it.  I really wanted to win this year.  (sighs) I've come so close so many times.  I can taste it.  FROND: And the winner is  Katie Waxman!  Aw.  And the winner is  Nicholas Mendoza!  (sighs)  And the winner is  Tina Belch â­(gasps)  Oh, wait, sorry. Trina Belson!  (groans)  (sighs) Now what am I gonna be?  You could go as a sore loser again.  You're great at that costume.  Okay, you guys, what about what about, what about  what about a sand-witch?  I've got fish sticks, but I'm open to the possibility.  No, no, I mean a sand-witch two pieces of bread  with a witch in the middle. Eh. â­Eh.  I'm gonna go to the library to research witches and bread.  Oh, sure, yeah, just check out that book Witches and Bread.  And then check out Vampires and Cake.  It's a classic.  TINA: Hi, Mr. Ambrose.  I'm looking for books on witches. â­Witches?  Yeah. I need to find some good pictures.  I'm gonna be a sand-witch for Halloween. Get it?  Yeah. I get it, yeah.  I mean, I know witches wear pointy hats  and fly on broomsticks, but it'd be helpful  to have a reference picture to work off of.  I really want to win the costume contest.  Witches don't wear pointy hats and fly on broomsticks.  They look like everyone else.  They do? Yeah, you're describing a stereotype.  Don't be a witchist.  I-I'm not! I didn't know.  I-I mean What-what do you mean?  Witches are powerful and alluring.  Wow. I like powerful and alluring.  How do you know so much about witches, Mr. Ambrose?  Duh! I work in a library!  Oh. Right. â­(whispering): And I am one!  What? â­I am one!  Shh! â­Really?  Don't look so surprised.  Listen, do you really want to win this contest?  Yes. Then be a witch.  I think I made it pretty clear I'm going to be a witch.  No, I mean be a witch.  Then you can cast a spell to win the contest.  There's such a thing as a spell to win a costume contest?  Of course there is. You think people just win  the Nobel Peace Prize?  I mean, I thought they did.  Wake up, Tina! Witches are everywhere.  Oh. â­Here. You can try a spell.  It might work, it might not.  Not everyone is able to do it.  Huh. Okay, well, I guess I'll give it a try.  But, Tina, beware.  Casting spells can be really dangerous.  Oh, wait, should I not  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you totally should.  But I'm just saying (whispers): beware!  Okay. Um, do I go now?  Yeah, you go.  TINA: My first spell.  Here I go into the dark arts.  ""First, carve the word 'contest' into a candle.""  Okay, did that.  ""Then light the candle and say the following words:  ""'I make this true by closing my eyes  and see myself winning first prize.'""  Tina! â­Aah!  We thought of another costume idea for you.  Cheer-bacca. It's Chewbacca in a cheerleading uniform.  What's, uh, happening in here?  You trying to cover up your room funk?  (sniffs) Whew, 'cause it's not working.  Wait, is that a spell book?  Mr. Ambrose gave me this book. He's a witch.  Seriously? Ambrose? Huh.  Well, he does ride to school on a bike  with a little dog in the front basket.  Yeah. So, I'm kinda  learning how to be a witch, too. â­What?! â­What?!  And I just cast a spell to win the costume contest.  What a fun way to cheat at a costume contest.  Well, after Tammy stole my idea, which was unfair,  I decided it was okay to be unfair.  I could use a spell. Anything in there to get me  out of my book report tomorrow? Huh.  Oh, there's a spell here that could work for you.  Cast it. Cast away. â­Don't bring up that movie!  You know I'll cry! â­Sorry.  Halloween's coming   Kids are trickin', kids are treatin'   Ghosts gonna spook, pumpkins gonna pump, la   Oh. â­What? You okay?  Did that get too scary for you?  No, I just realized I forgot to take my jack-o'-lantern inside.  I'm gonna go get it.  Oh, okay.  Guess I'm doing the dishes myself.  Kids are trickin', kids are treatin'   I wrote ""no book report"" on here.  Now I just have to burn it.  Aah! Okay, that's probably burnt enough.  Cast a spell for me, too! I want fish sticks  for tomorrow's lunch at school.  Wait, wasn't that today's lunch?  What's your point? Nothing, nothing.  Dream your crazy dream. Let me see.  Um, okay.  ""Fish sticks are what we desire.  Give us this food; our hunger is on fire.""  Nice. â­Oh, look at that.  Love spells. Maybe I'll just do a quick one.  Shocking. I just need something of Jimmy Jr.'s.  Maybe his old, um, gym sock?  You have a drawer of Jimmy Jr.'s things?  Just his socks. And his old retainer.  And his toothbrush.  Why so many wet marshmallows?  From his hot chocolate. Okay, um  Jimmy Jr., Jimmy Jr., Jimmy Jr.  Okay. Done. Give me one of those marshmallows.  I want to do a spell where I put it in my mouth.  Mmm, mmm, mmm. It's working.  What the  Someone took it?  Who steals a pumpkin?  Smash it if you're gonna do something!  Stop yelling! Sorry, Edith.  Someone took my pumpkin.  TMI!  GENE: Tina, look!  Is that a fish stick?  Yes! Spell fulfilled. I found it in my locker.  I was using it as a bookmark.  That's not all. Guess who got jury duty.  Who? Dish.  Ms. Labonz! We had a substitute,  and I didn't have to do my book report!  Wow. So those spells actually worked.  But what about my love spell? Hey, Tina.  Hey, Jimmy Jr., Zeke.  Got some lunch, huh? Where are you gonna sit?  I don't know. Can we sit here? â­Sure.  Move over, Rover! Come on! â­Ow.  Son of a witch. (Jimmy Jr. and Zeke arguing)  The spells worked!  (quietly): I guess I'm a real witch.  We'd better get you registered for some cauldrons.  Get Crate and Barrel on the phone.  (Bob snoring)  (sniffs) Bob?  Do you smell that? Something's burning.  Okay, you keep sleeping. I'll go save our lives.  Normal.  Normal.  Normal What?!  Tina, what the hell is going on?!  (groans) Mom. It's hard to explain.  You wouldn't get it. I get that it's late  and you're gonna burn the house down.  It's like Kenny G's rehearsal space in here.  (blowing)  Linda Belcher, not a peep.  Close your eyes and go to sleep.  I am going to sleep. All right.  Good night. No more candles.  Don't call me Linda Belcher. It's creepy.  (rock intro playing)  Ha-ha, ha, ha, ha   Ow! Tina! What the hell?  Darryl, I hear you're gonna be E.T. for Halloween.  You might want to phone home to me  to congratulate me on winning.  Hey, Peter, your costume is gonna be the Mona Lisa?  Yeah. â­Well, you might want to  Mone home after I win the contest.  What?  Jimmy Jr., want to walk my ass to class?  Uh okay.  Someone woke up all witchy today.  What do you got there, a second jack-o'-lantern?  Actually, it's my third.  The first one was my fault; I forgot to bring it in.  But the second one, when I put it out  I'll tell it, I'll tell it! It's a mystery.  Bob was locking up the restaurant when he remembered  the jack-o'-lantern was still sitting there.  He looked away for a second to unlock the door,  and when he turned back,  the jack-o'-lantern had vanished!  And then he went, ""No!""  I-I didn't scream, ""No"" I said, ""No.""  Actually, I don't even think I said, ""No.""  I think I said something cool, like a swear.  So the pumpkin just disappeared? Oh, spooky.  Well, I mean, someone took it and was very good at doing that.  Or something. Like a ghost.  (gasps) â­It wasn't a ghost.  I'm staying away from that pumpkin just in case.  Okay. Done.  I'm putting it outside.  Outside? Are you nuts?  Leave it in here where it's safe.  No, no, no, no, Lin, I want someone  to try and take this one.  And I'm gonna catch them when they do.  This pumpkin is bait.  Bait for a ghost. Pumpkin Ghost,  I want it on record, I have nothing to do with this!  Me neither! It's just Bob!  Get him! Don't get us! Sorry, Bob.  I cast all the spells in this book.  Can I get a new one?  You cast all the spells? â­Yeah.  It's a reference book.  You're not supposed to run through it like an Us Weekly!  Well, I did. I think I'm good at this witch thing.  Ugh. You've been a witch for, what, two days?  Take it down a notch!  You're playing with powerful forces!  This is not kids' stuff!  I am powerful forces.  Witch, please!  Fine. I don't need your books.  I'll just go on the Internet.  Because print is dead.  Tell me about it.  Can you log me into the computer?  Yeah, sure, yeah.  TINA: (groans) This is taking forever.  It's the last phase of a waning moon.  We're wasting good spell-casting time.  I'm beginning to understand why they burned witches.  Yeah, T, you don't have to be such a spell hound.  Okay to cross.  Finally. I thought this was a crosswalk,  not a ""wait around all day"" walk.  Excuse me?  You heard me.  You watch your mouth.  You watch my mouth cast a spell on you.  Excuse me?  Didn't we just do this?  You're gonna cast a spell on me?  I could.  Really? â­Really.  Hey! What are you doing?  My barrette. Give it back.  Can't. I need it for my spell.  Your spell?  In 24 hours, your fate will be worse,  'cause the girl who cast spells now is cursed!  You can keep crossing now.  Wait, but  Cross! (screams)  Oh, my God.  Did you just get cursed?  I think so?  Look on the bright side:  your hair looks great like that.  Tina, you okay?  You're just pushing around your meatballs.  Are you eating dinner or playing pool?  (chuckles) â­Yeah  I'm just kind of distracted  thinking about this thing someone said to me today.  Wha? What thing?  It's about being cursed and my fate.  You know, that kind of thing.  Sheesh, school bullies have gotten so much more poetic.  Back in my day, you just got called  ""poop-stain-pinkpants"" or something.  They would just say it over and over again.  (screams) Did you guys see that?  The knife almost stabbed my foot!  You could've lost a toe.  But maybe that little weird one. That would've been fine.  BOB: Hey, Lin? Can you bring me the salt?  Come get it yourself!  You know I can't leave my post.  LINDA: Bob, Tina got cursed today!  Oh. Sorry, Tina!  Would it help if you brought me the salt?  Just come get it, Bob!  Fine!  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick,  quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick  I've never seen Dad move that fast  when it wasn't bathroom related.  (Bob screams)  It's gone!  LINDA: What? Really?  You made me come get the salt!  Wait a minute.  Pesto.  Jimmy Pesto didn't steal your pumpkin, Bob.  He's bussing a table. Oh, he did it.  I don't know how he did it, but he did it.  I'm watching you, Jimmy!  I'm watching you! Oh, yeah?  Watch this.  (farts) Zoom! Ha!  No, Jimmy, no, not zoom!  I do don't go inside!  (muffled): I cannot hear you!  Ha, ha, ha!  Oh, my God!  (wind whistling softly)  Huh.  Why is my window open?  (gasps)  (chuckles nervously)  That was weird.  JACKIE (whispering): The girl who cast spells  now is cursed!  (screams)  (cackling)  (screaming)  You know what? I'm gonna cross down there.  Does it have to do with the woman who cursed you  waving you into the street?  Is it just so you can get your steps in today?  Yeah I'll catch up with you guys later.  It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.  (screams) BIKER: Bike lane, ma'am!  Sorry! Cursed!  And I'm only 13; please don't call me ""ma'am.""  Mr. Ambrose?  Yes, Goth Brooks?  I think I got cursed  Yawn.  by Jackie the crossing guard.  Did you say ""Jackie the crossing guard""?  Yeah. â­Oh, if that's true, you're in trouble.  Jackie's a witch. A mean witch.  God! How many witches are there at this school?!  I told you, witches are everywhere!  I thought you were just being dramatic!  I was! But it's also true!  Then it's not just being dramatic!  I did both!  Jackie and I used to be in the same coven.  She's a powerful witch.  But she always wanted to go dark.  Revenge spells this. Curse your enemies that.  And she never chipped in for pizza.  Whoa. Tell me exactly what she said.  First, she took my barrette.  Oh, God. What?  Oh, forget it. Keep going.  Um And then she said,  ""In 24 hours, your fate will be worse,  'cause the girl who cast spells now is cursed.""  Okay. So yeah. You're cursed.  Oh, no!  (both scream)  Hey, do you think there's any way  I could get you to leave the library? â­What?  I don't want to die in some freak accident  just because I'm next to you. So get out!  Out! â­(screams)  Best of luck!  I know. I know what you're doing.  Oh, yeah? Well, I know what you're doing.  You're stinking up my sidewalk.  (laughs) â­Ha! 'Cause he stinks.  Yeah, that's right, Trev.  No. I know about the pumpkins, Jimmy.  You've been sneaking over on your kitty cat paws  in the dark to my place.  Eh okay.  Wow. Finally snapped, huh, Bob?  Pumpkinhead's lost his gourd. (laughs)  Whoa. Mental illness. No joke.  No, don't say ""mental illness.""  Come on, you're ruining it. Just  Not a joke.  Listen, just go inside, would ya?  It's a disease. (stammers)  Would you go inside? I'm talking to Bob.  Jimmy, you steal this one, I'm gonna call the police.  And they will come, immediately,  because this is serious.  Zoom.  Hey, hey. Don't say ""zoom."" That's mine.  Zoom, Jimmy.  Hey  Zoom, Jimmy!  On your right, ma'am. Ooh! Sorry.  I'm not a ma'am. Close enough!  (indistinct chatter)  TAMMY: Tina, you have to admit that I look better  as a hot mess than you would have if it had been your idea.  Tammy, it doesn't matter because I'm gonna win  the contest that much I know.  I just hope I don't die first.  What? â­What are you talking about?  I don't speak bread. â­Yeah.  Tina, we came back to say break a leg.  But not really. I know you're worried about that.  What if the curse happens now, during the contest?  Tina, nothing's gonna happen.  Just wiggle your nose or something  and un-curse yourself.  (both screaming)  Do you have a lint roller?  No! God! Wait, yes, I do.  Can I borrow it? â­Yep, yep. Here you go.  Welcome to the Wagstaff Costume Contest!  Let's kick off this monster mash.  (laughing)  First, we have Rudy Stieblitz as  Marcel Marceau!  (applause)  And next we have Peter Pescadero as the Mona Lisa.  Isn't she mysterious sort of?  (applause continues)  And next is Tina Belcher as a sand-witch.  Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.  (gasps)  Here I go, from bread to dead.  (nervous laughing) Ha, ha, ha.  (harsh whisper): Tina! Let's keep it moving!  Ha, ha, ha. â­LOUISE: Psst. Tina.  What's going on up there?  You're going a weird way with the sand-witch character.  No one gets it.  I think the curse is gonna happen now,  while I'm on stage.  (groans) What if I fall?  Um, well, Gene and I  can stay down here and walk next to you.  We'll catch you.  And then we'll pass you around like you were  intentionally crowd-surfing.  (groans) â­Excuse me. Pardon me.  Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. â­Excuse me. Pardon me.  (harsh whisper): Tina, what is going on?  I know this isn't normally how you walk down a catwalk.  I'm walking slowly because something terrible  is gonna happen to me right now.  I accidentally pissed off the wrong witch, and now I'm cursed.  Wait. Were we supposed to prepare a speech?  I don't know.  Maybe I got a little carried away.  Maybe I-I shouldn't have cast so many spells.  On you. And you. And you. Lot of love spells. Sorry.  Ugh! What? What are you talking about?  I also cast a spell to win this contest,  and I know I shouldn't have done that.  But now that I think about it, I'm not sure  my spells worked in the first place.  I mean, I don't even know if this stuff is real.  I think it was more just something  that made me feel more confident.  Jimmy Jr., maybe you just responded  to my bold attitude and choker necklace.  Eh, I don't know. I liked it!  And come to think of it, Gene always  has fish sticks in his locker.  Oh, yeah, I do.  And maybe Ms. Labonz getting jury duty  was just a coincidence.  He was guilty. We were done before lunch.  I went to the mall for the rest of the day.  Okay. (chuckles) We're just gonna keep moving along.  And next we have Tammy Larson  dressed as a hot mess. â­(grunting)  Love it. So original.  (groans) Hot mess. That's how this whole thing started!  I wanted to win the contest so bad.  I'm sorry I got myself into this stupid curse!  I'm sorry I said those things to you, Jackie. I'm sorry!  And I'm sorry I ever listened to you  about witchcraft, Mr. Ambrose!  I have no idea what she's talking about.  (harsh whisper): Stop it! Shh!  Jackie, if you're gonna do something to me,  just do it already! I'm done being a witch,  and I'm done with this curse! (groans)  I'm just gonna try and be more confident  and less mean to crossing guards.  I know that's a really clichÃ© thing to say,  but I mean it.  Move it, loaf! (grunts)  Whoa!  I got her! I got her! I got her! I got her!  Oh, no! Aah! (screams)  (audience gasps) TINA: I'm okay! Tammy broke my fall.  TAMMY: Oh, my God, I can't feel my legs!  TINA: Those are my legs. TAMMY: Ew! Gross!  Get your legs off me!  Congratulations, Rudy.  Sorry you fell, Tina.  Not our fault. We were nailing it, for the record.  Do we have to keep spotting you for the rest of your life?  I don't know. I guess maybe?  Uh-oh. Here comes Jackie. Louise, hands up.  Here we go. â­Uh  I accept your apology. Here's your barrette.  Consider yourself un-cursed.  Okay, phew. You have to admit, we got a little crazy.  I mean, you more than me, but  Re-cursed! What?!  Kidding! Oh. Good. â­Whew!  You got me. I mean, don't get me.  I mean, we're cool, right? (nervous laugh)  (cackles)  Uh, sorry, that's just my laugh. Yeah, we're cool.  Bob, you can't just stare at Jimmy Pesto all day.  He's gonna try for it, Lin.  I know he's coming for this one.  Oh, my God!  Mr. Fischoeder! What are you doing?  Hello, Bob.  I'm taking this jack-o'-lantern home  to put with the others.  Wait. You're the one who's been stealing my jack-o'-lanterns?  Stealing? No. I thought we had an understanding.  You carve them and leave them out, and then I take them.  It's-it's like how people keep giving me bikes.  That's insane.  Well, you're the one who keeps doing it.  How many have you made, four, five?  Well, what are you doing with them?  What aren't I doing with them?  Come to my house tonight and I'll show you.  Um  Welcome to Jack-O-Land!  Your Halloween just got a little Halloween-er.  Wow! Oh, it's so pretty. And spooky.  See how much less pathetic they look over here  than they did on your sidewalk?  Oh, it's like night and day. Linda.  What? They're happy here. Look at them.  We could never give them all this.  Children, you want a picture  with your father's burg-o'-lanterns?  - Sure. Yes! â­Okay. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's, uh, five dollars.  Father, pay the man.  I'm not paying for a picture  of you with my jack-o'-lanterns.  Come on, Bob. It's Halloween.  (sighs) Fine. (kids cheering)  Where do you want these bikes, Mr. Fischoeder?  Around the back, Freddy! You got it.  Good man. â­Teddy. It's Teddy.

How does that sound? It's not about the money.  Is it about the meat? Is that what it's about?  'Cause I can replace the horse meat  in your fridge with real beef, okay?  I just have to find a distributor  that sells beef, that's  Jack, I'm giving this tape to the health inspector.  Okay, Bob.  You got to do what you got to do, and I, I respect that.  What is that over there?  Is that an active volcano? Huh?  Give it to me!  (both grunting)  Give me it! â­Got it!  Lin!  Kids, we're going!  We are minutes away from cake!  Okay, I don't think there's any hair on this one,  so I'm just gonna eat it, okay?  (grunts) â­Damn it, Tina!  I got to go! See you at school!  Thanks for having us!  Bob,  you forgot to hug the host good-bye.  (both grunting)  BOB (grunting): Uh uh  That crazy son of a bitch.  He's gonna slide.  Coming through! Coming through!  Slide, you old bastard!  The grass is wet! He's still sliding!  (Bob shouting)  Is that Bob's head?  Hugo, Ron, I'm stuck!  That was an amazing slide, Bob!  But now I'm gonna need that tape recorder.  Hugo, catch! No, don't!  (distorted): I'm not good  at catching things!  (muttering)  I've never been good at it!  Ha-ha! Yes!  It's broken!  Hey, look. The tape's okay.  Aw, damn it.  Happy birthday, punk.  Looks like Jimmy Pesto's still mad at me  for bringing his meat prices back up.  (making fart sounds)  So, uh, Bob, think I could get one of those,  uh, burgers from you?  Sure, coming right up, Teddy.  Know what I'm saying, Bob  a (hums) burger?  No, what are you talking about?  One of those special (hums) burgers?  You know?  (hums) Looks like a duck.  Quacks like a duck.  (neighs) â­Oh, my God.  Teddy, we don't sell horse anymore.  Oh, come on!  I can't stop thinking about it!  I loved it!  Hey, Belchers.  Here comes Jack   Walking through your doorway.   Jack! (laughing): Hi!  What a surprise!  Uh, what are you doing here?  Shouldn't you be in, like, meat jail or something?  No, I'll probably be able to stay out of jail,  but, uh, there are a lot of fines and legal fees.  I'm still slippy sliding, though.  And for those two seconds, I forget everything.  They can't take that away from me, can they?  I mean, they can.  And they said they were going to.  Well, what do you want now?  Are you gonna sell us napkins that are really trees?!  Easy, girl, easy.  No one's killing trees.  No, no, I-I, I just  came by to apologize.  Oh. â­I also wanted to say thank you.  Really? â­Yeah.  I'm done selling horse meat.  I mean, obviously, you know.  I mean I got caught. Ha ha.  I mean, I Like, done done? (chuckl mean, just  Absolutely done.  Just putting that in your rearview mirror, huh?  It's in the past.  Not-not doing it at all?  Not doing it at all. â­Okay.  But I think I know what I want to do  with my life from now on.  What, what do you want to do?  I started writing a book  about my experiences.  I'm calling it Friday Night Meats.  Wha? I-I don't really get the reference.  Uh, it's a movie and a TV show.  You've never heard of it?  Yeah, I have heard of it.  He's not really a football fan.  No, I like football.  I just don't know why you would  call it Friday Night Meats, that's  I get it. â­""Chapter one  ""It was a Friday night, and I was selling meats.  ""Horse meats.  It was Friday Night Meats.""  LINDA: That's good. BOB: Oh, my God.  (ska playing) JACK: Here comes the meat plane   Right to your counter   FEMALE CHORUS: Ooh   Here comes the meat plane   Right to your counter   Ooh  Again   BOB: Jack. Jack Attack.

What a surprise!  Here comes Jack right through your doorway, yeah."
"1  LINDA: La, la, la   Going to the accountant, gonna do our taxes   At the last minute, we're adults   Responsible adults, yeah!   That's a beautiful song, Linda. Where's it from?  No, Teddy, we really are going  to the accountant to do our taxes.  We probably shouldn't have waited  until the last possible moment on the last possible day,  but it is kind of our tradition.  Aw, that's true! So special.  I don't know why you guys need an accountant.  It's fun to do your own taxes.  No. Mm no. It's fine.  Our accountant isn't that expensive, and he's really good.  Or pretty good. He's fine. Yeah.  We go for an hour, we pretend to laugh at his jokes.  Ugh, the jokes.  Then we're done for the year.  Why do you pretend to laugh at his jokes?  Well, he's in charge of our money, Teddy.  We have to be nice to him.  I mean, I think he takes away a dependent  every time we don't laugh.  Well, good luck with that. I'm going down to the docks.  I'm helping out with Lobsterfest.  Ugh. Lobsterfest.  What's wrong with Lobsterfest?  There's too much lobster.  Yeah, that's this year's theme: too much lobster!  All right, well, have fun.  You, too, going to the accountant.  Hey, Accountantfest. Too much taxes!  Yup. (groans)  Okay. Bye, Teddy!  TINA: Whoa. Eye contact.  Did I just have significant E.C. with Joe Harrison?  It felt like it. That's weird.  I barely know him. Hmm.  Look at me again.  Look at me. Look at me. Ugh!  Joe, where do you think you're going?  You have detention, young man.  (sighs) Fine.  TINA: Detention, huh?  Ugh! Reading is dumb!  Tina, what is going on? Your mom.  What?! Is dumb.  And reading is dumb.  You just earned yourself detention.  Got it. Sorry about all that.  Well, I'm sorry, too. Maybe you don't need detention  Shove it! Oh, okay, definitely detention.  TINA: Eyes on the prize, which is Joe's eyes.  LINDA: I can't believe  Tina got detention.  We needed her to babysit you two.  Mom, we've been over this.  Gene and I are fine by ourselves.  You let us babysit Aunt Gayle whenever you go out of town,  and she's a handful.  Mm. I don't know. Bob, what do you think?  I guess. I mean, it is just an hour, and we'll be close by.  All right, but I'm setting a lot of rules.  Don't open the door to anybody.  What if it's a guy with a gun and he really needs to pee?  No.  And don't use the stove or knives  or the bathtub or matches.  Well, then how are we gonna have a hot knife bath?  And if anyone calls for us,  say that we're home, but we're pooping.  No, say I'm in the shower, but I look good for my age.  Guys, guys, we got it. We'll be fine. I'm in charge.  You don't have anything to worry about.  Well, technically, Gene's in charge.  He is? I am? Yes.  He's your big brother, Louise.  I mean, big brother?  I think of him more as a large brother.  No offense. Yes, offense!  It's just, you don't really do  the traditional big brother stuff.  You don't call me squirt, you aren't good at baseball,  and I have to give you a piggyback ride  when your legs get tired.  Just 'cause Dad's not strong enough.  Louise, Gene is older than you though,  so I guess your mother has a point.  Yeah! I'm large and in charge. Literally.  (laughs): Okay.  (quietly): Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.  Now get out of here, you crazy kids. Go!  We'll be back in an hour.  Remember what I told you. Yup.  Okay, bye bye. Bye. Yup.  (door opens, closes) So, forbidden snack time?  As your king, I declare them unforbidden!  I like how you think.  TINA: Moment of truth.  It's just me and Joe.  And all these other kids.  Time to figure out if lightning strikes twice.  In our eyes.  I have the perfect angle.  Don't sit down there. No, no, no, no. Damn it!  Okay, okay, I can maybe still see Joe.  (groaning)  Just a casual lean.  No big deal.  Almost there.  Almost  (gasps) I'm okay.  GERALD: Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-  Ba-Ba-Belchers!  Hey, guys. You pumped to get these taxes done or what?  Yup. Love 'em. Love taxes. (whoops)  Cool. 'Tis the season. That's what I always say.  Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la tax.   (both laughing)  You guys want some water or anything before we get started?  I'll have my secretary grab some. Just kidding.  I don't have a secretary. (laughs)  (chuckles) Oh. It's very funny.  You guys want a butterscotch cookie?  One of my clients made them for me.  They look delicioso.  Mmm. Oh, my God, these are good!  Bob? Uh, sure, I'll have one.  Ooh, I'll have one more. Mmm. Good.  All right, let me just pull out my tax-ophone.  And tune it up.  (imitating saxophone music)  Okay, let's just get started, could we?  LOUISE: Okay, let's make sure  we're on the same page here.  We're making 17 layer dip, correct? Correct.  But we won't put in a 13th layer because it's bad luck.  I'm going to visit the produce drawers  and look for mom's hidden bacon bits  that she thinks we don't know about.  (gasps) Xanadu.  Gene. Come. See.  What is it?  It's softer than  the tops of Dad's legs.  Oh, I know exactly what it is.  It's a cantaloupe.  Remember when Mom put it under her shirt  at the grocery store and pretended  she had another boob, and then they made her buy it?  (gasps) That was three years ago!  We got to throw it. Wh-What?  We got to throw it off the fire escape into the back alley.  Yes! Wait, maybe no.  This seems like possibly a bad idea  that could get us into trouble.  And I guess I'm in charge, so  Gene, don't overthink it.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  We've never been home alone before,  and we've never found a rotten cantaloupe before.  Are you saying this is proof there's a God?  I'm not saying it isn't.  Gene, when life hands you moldy melons,  you make moldy melon-ade.  All right, let's do it. Let's throw a melon!  That's the spirit! There you go, large bro!  TINA: Joe.  Joe, Joe, Joe.  I've never even thought about Joe that way before,  but maybe he's been thinking about me that way all along.  Maybe today, he looked at himself in the mirror,  and he said, ""Today's the day  that you tell Tina how you feel.""  He's probably a mess right now.  I've got to make eye contact again. I (groans)  I can't see him from this position though!  All right, time to turn my desk.  Detention is two hours.  If I move the desk an inch every five minutes,  I'll be able to see Joe's eyes in about 90 minutes.  Here goes. FROND: Tina.  No moving your desk.  TINA: Damn it!  I'll find another way. Wait for me, Joe.  Okay. I just want to verify  that this year your retirement contribution was zero.  That sounds right. (phone rings)  Oh, I'm sorry, I have to get that.  I sent Pamela home early today.  (laughs) Just  Remember? (laughs)  There's nobody there.  I-I remember.  Hello. This is Gerald.  Oh, hey, Tim.  Yeah, I've got the cookies right here.  Okay.  Under no circumstances should we eat these cookies?  Oh, my God. Oh, my What?  Right, but (laughs)  Let's just say maybe we ate some.  Mm. I-I had two.  Uh, I-I only had one.  I had three, hello!  Okay, well, uh, thanks for telling us.  Bye. Gerald,  what's happening? What's going on?  Uh, it turns out the cookies I gave you  have marijuana in them a lot of it.  Oh, no.  I-I guess  Tim made two batches of cookies.  These were for his mom.  She apparently ate hers and didn't get high, so  Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.  We can't get stoned in the middle of the day.  We're old. We have kids!  Oh, God. This is bad.  Stupid cookies! They were good though.  Maybe I'll just have one more. Lin, no.  Gene, we are about to make history.  And here we  Uh-oh. go!  (distorted): No!  Aah!  What the?! Ugh, dude.  Oh, my God. Is that Logan?  (chuckles)  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow, wow, wow.  Louise Belcher.  Hide. Hide. Hide. Hide. Hide. Hide. Hide. Hide.  (laughs) Oh, you just made my day.  I wanted to work out some of this hostility  I'm feeling all the time,  which Dr. Swanson says is totally normal,  but I was like, how am I gonna do that?  Now I know.  I'm gonna clear my schedule  so that I can make your lives a living hell!  Uh, I think you forgot about that thing you have today!  Remember that thing? You can't miss that thing!  You are dead, Louise Belcher!  (chuckles): Okay, look, that was an accident.  A hilarious accident that I wish I had on video.  You don't have to get all crazy-face mad about it, okay?  Logan, come on. Let's hit the park.  You guys go. I'm gonna figure out  how to ruin Louise's life for a while.  All right, dude. We believe in you.  Well, we're gonna go inside and watch TV now.  Fine. I'm just gonna go around front,  ring the doorbell and tell your parents what you did.  Well, joke's on you because they aren't home.  Yeah!  Oh, your parents aren't home? Interesting.  That expands my options.  Well, our boyfriend is coming over any minute  and he has a Bowflex!  I don't I don't think I'm high.  Me neither.  I feel like I'm peeing.  Am I peeing right now?  Bob, can you check?  So, are-are our taxes, like, mostly done?  Wow, look at all these numbers.  Oh, boy.  What are they, right?  How do we assign value to symbols?  I swear I'm peeing. Bob, can someone see?  Will you please stop? Stop peeing?  No, stop saying ""I'm peeing.""  Am I pretty?  TINA: Okay, time to take bold action.  May I go to the restroom?  (sighs) Fine.  But no dawdling.  TINA: And now for the slight head turn.  Keep it casual, and  The briefest of glances   Can start the biggest romances   Our eyes were doing the dances and they were   Making advances   When our eyes met, I was like, hey, now   I bet that Joe could be the one   FROND: Tina! What?  What are you doing? You're just standing there.  Are you gonna go to the bathroom or not?  Just one second.  Are you the one?   (fireworks popping)  Okay, now I'm going.  LOUISE: Is, uh, Stalker Texas Ranger  still out there? It's been almost an hour.  He's there.  I wonder if maybe we should, you know, apologize,  so he won't be so mad and he won't kill us?  Gene, relax. He's down there,  and we're way up here with the doors locked.  Don't tell me you're actually scared of him.  No, I'm scared of something else.  It's just a coincidence that I'm staring at a really mean  high school kid who's down there doing karate on a parked car!  All right, all right, I'll talk to him.  Excuse me. Oh, good.  Hey, Logan, go home and take a shower.  You're smellin' of melon! Oh, God.  I'm never going home and I am never taking a shower  until I get my revenge.  Oh, man, you're gonna be sorry, Louise.  I am sorry that I'm still talking to you.  Louise, maybe don't  I was thinking I'd just give you a noogie  or maybe a swirly, but I've changed my mind.  Now I'm gonna give you a Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold!  (quietly): Oh, man, did he just say  the Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold?  You do not want the Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold.  What? That's a real thing?  It's the signature move of the professional wrestler  Norwegian Steven.  Since when do you watch wrestling?  I have a life, Louise!  Well, what's a whatever whatever Stink Hold?  It doesn't even sound scary.  Well, it is.  When Norwegian Steven's got his opponent on the ropes,  he pulls them into a headlock like this Ooh.  and then he pinches them like this Whoa.  until they have to breathe in his B.O.!  Well, I'm not gonna worry about that.  He's never getting up here.  I'm gonna jump up there and grab you!  (grunting) Put your hand out.  No, thank you.  Uh, he'll tire himself out soon enough.  La, la, la, la   La, la-la-la-la  (whispering): I don't like it.  Don't like what? (grunts)  What?

Hello.  LOGAN: Hey, Louise. What do you want, Logan?  I just wanted to tell you that I'm in your house.  Oh, yeah? I don't see you.  And why would you call me to tell me that?  'Cause I wanted to make it menacing,  like in the movies, with the spooky music.  (singing spooky music)  Well, that's not menacing at all.  It's relaxing, actually.  Okay, but if I'm not in your house,  then who's in your kitchen?  (thump) (gasps)  Holy crap! Gene, Logan got in the house somehow.  What?!  Logan is in the house! Run! Aah!  Ha-ha!  (both scream)  But you were I heard you.  Let's just say you left the window open,  and let's just say that I'm really good  at throwing shoes through windows,  and let's just say that I'm also gonna need that shoe back.  And now I'm gonna take you to Pitts-burg.  Get it?  I get it. Pretty good.  Thanks. Run!  LOUISE: Go, Gene! Go! Casket delivery.  (grunts) Hey!  Come on! We'll lose him at Lobsterfest.  But the festivities don't begin until 5:00  if you're VIP, or 6:00 if you have a general admission ticket,  and 7:00 if you're only here to see the B-52s!  (panting) Ooh, nice potholders!  Quick, quick, Gene, in there!  Nothing lifts a pal up   Like a scallop   It's not selfish to love shellfish!   Fantastic! Let's run it one more time,  and then we'll do the shrimp number.  Okay, Gene, I have a plan. Great.  I have diarrhea.  TINA: Huh, that's weird.  Am I crazy, or is that spark we had gone?  Is that spark we had gone?   I was once so sure, now I fear I was wrong.   (singing quietly)  Tina?  Tina? Tina! I was wrong.   Hmm? You're mumbling.  And your pencil is just an eraser now.  I-I think you're done.  I don't know if I'm done,  but I sure have a lot to think about.  What?!  (sighs): Ah.  Doesn't that feel good?  Tape fingers. Please stop.  Gerald, can I do it to you?  Yes.  I like it.  There it is. Look at that.  Linda, I was wrong about you.  I like you.  I like you, too, Gerald.  Even if your jokes aren't funny.  Mm-mm. Mm-mm.  Oh. You don't like my jokes?  What? No!  I mean, yeah.  I mean, kind of.  I mean, no. Linda.  But you always laugh at them.  Everyone laughs at them.  Because we like you. Everyone likes you.  And it's not at all because you're their accountant  and they're scared of being audited. Not at all.  (chuckles): I uh, I actually like them.  I love them.  No, you don't, Bob. Don't lie.  Oh, God. Oh, God.  I always thought if accounting didn't work out,  I could quit and do stand-up.  You-you could do bad stand-up.  That's really popular.  This is the worst day of my life.  I don't even feel like doing taxes.  No, no, you-you should do some.  It'll make you feel better.  (doorbell buzzes) Oh, my God!  What is that?! Did you guys hear that?!  That's the doorbell. Who's here?  I'll go see. No! No!  (doorbell buzzes)  (quietly): Oh, crap.  That's my next client.  He probably wants me to do his taxes.  We got to hide.  Yes. Absolutely.  Great plan. (doorbell buzzes)  We should build a fort with the cushions.  That way, even if he gets in, he won't see us.  Okay, but I'm still sad,  so I want my own room in the fort  to reflect and figure out where to go from here.  You absolutely deserve that.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Where are you guys going? We're about to rehearse.  GENE: Uh, there's a shrimp emergency in the ocean.  Wait a minute. Aren't you two a little shrimpy to be shrimps?  LOUISE: Don't you shrimp-shame me!  Okay, you guys need  to take those costumes off immediately.  Louise! (both yelling)  Run, Gene, run! No, no, no, no, no, no!  Don't get the tails dirty!  (both panting)  Did we lose him? I think we lost him.  (gasps)  Great choice of hiding place, guys.  There's no way out.  Oh, God!

(sniffles)  (groans) Wait!  If you're gonna give anyone the Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold,  it's gonna be me.  What was that, little fella?  Oh, my God! I think I just said,  if you are gonna give anyone the Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold,  it's gonna be me!  Get out of my way.  No! I am very scared right now, but I'm not moving!  Gene, don't.  Okay, you asked for it.  (grunting)  Whiff it up, little man! Whiff it up!  (Gene groaning) LOGAN: Oh. Yeah. Oh.  (sighs)  Hey, Linda. What?  I think I'm okay to go home now.  Plus, I mean, at some point, we just have to go home.  But we can't just leave Gerald like this.  You got to talk to him.  (sighs) Okay.  Hey, buddy. Hey, Bob.  Look, I'm I-I make burgers,  but I also do this little chalkboard  with the burgers of the day, and I think they are  hilarious, but they probably aren't.  They're okay.  They're bad, but that's okay, because they make me laugh.  I do it for me, and you're a really good accountant, right?  I hope.  I'm pretty good.  So just keep on doing that.  Keep on accountin'.  But also, make your jokes, because you like them, okay?  But work on 'em. More.  Okay. Wait!  You guys can't leave. What's gonna happen to me?  You're gonna be fine, Gerald.  You still have the fort.  Listen, this is very important.  Later tonight, when you aren't high anymore,  we need you to finish and mail our taxes.  Can you describe them to me, Bob?  Oh, my God. I'm just kidding.  (laughs) Hey, she laughed.  She did! Play us out with the tax-ophone?  (imitating saxophone music)  TINA: Ugh, it's so awkward.  Knowing he's back there, expecting me to look at him  the way I've always looked at him.  It's not fair to him or to me.  I've got to show him my breakup eyes.  Like this.  Whoa, whoa, easy, Tina girl.  That was way too harsh. No need to be mean.  I need to use my let-him-down-easy eyes.  Like this.  Yeah, that's it.  Okay, here it goes.  He took that pretty well.  He's hurting, but he doesn't want to let it show.  That's Joe. (chuckles)  I'll never forget him.  How was it, Gene? Was it bad?  It was painful. Yeah?  And smelly. Yeah.  But I've been through things  that were more painful and more smelly.  Just not since my own birth.  Mmm! Aah!  What's happening?! Thanks for doing that.  You're a great large brother.  Anytime, shrimp.  Yeah, that was definitely our kids.  Why are they dressed as shrimps?  And why are they hugging? Do they do that?  I didn't know they did that.  Ooh, hey, look at that.  Wow. Right?  TINA:  The briefest of glances can start the biggest romances   Our eyes were doing the dances and they were making advances   When our eyes met, I was like   Hey, now I bet that Joe could be the one   The briefest of glances can start the biggest romances   Our eyes were doing the dances and they were making advances   When our eyes met, I was like  When our eyes met   Hey, now I bet that Joe could be the one   Are you the one?"
"1  You guys are into rosemary, right?  The lady who had the baby?  No, the herb.  I'm looking for recipes for Thanksgiving next week.  Uh-oh, somebody's getting excited about Thanksgiving.  Mm, maybe.  He's freaking out. Look at him.  Yeah, he's pulling his hair out.  Oh, wait, no. That was like that.  Hmm. Bald joke. Yeah.  What you doing, Tina?  You didn't finish your homework last night?  Oh, this isn't homework.  I'm working on some erotic holiday fiction.  Hmm. Oh, like the one you wrote  where St. Patrick got his groove back?  Oh, y-you read that? Yeah.  I loved that one.  Wait, you read it, too?  I mean, I heard about it.  When I-I was reading it out loud.  I overheard some of it. I heard it, too.  What's this one about, Tina?  Well, this one's for Thanksgiving,  and it's called ""The Quirky Turkey.""  It's about a turkey who wears glasses.  Also, she has skinny legs  that she may or may not hide with knee-high socks.  And she feels left out because she doesn't look  like all the other turkeys.  Is that about you?  (nervous chuckle): No. No. What?  All right, fine, it might have been inspired  by a real-life event where  a certain word was thrown around.  Hi, guys. (chuckles)  Tina, you're so quirky.  She's right, you are. You are.  You are. Oh, my God, you really are.  Oh, my God, she's, like, so quirky.  Wait, is quirky a good thing?  (laughs) That's such a quirky thing to ask.  So, yeah, I'm taking back the ""Q"" bomb  and mixing in a fun holiday message.  Well, that doesn't sound very erotic.  Which is totally fine.  No, some stuff happens with a pig. Oh.  Some suggestive situations, implied nudity.  Oh, okay, I got it.  So how's it end?  The not-quirky turkeys realize  that they aren't there for dinner, they are dinner.  And they get their heads chopped off on Thanksgiving.  Aw, that's nice.  So, you excited?  My little turkeys get a long weekend.  (sighs) I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving,  but I am not looking forward to the day before Thanksgiving.  We have to sit through one of Mr. Frond's stupid plays again.  I'm still bored from last year's play.  (flatly): We're thankful for   These foods we're eating   Here's a list of foods we're eating   A, apples   A, apple pie   Yeah, Mr. Frond's plays aren't great,  but isn't going to a play better  than going to actual school?  I mean, do you guys like school?  I've never asked you that.  That's the thing!  The day before Thanksgiving is supposed to be a half day.  It's on the school schedule.  And in most Bibles.  At least in the Ving Rhames version.  (chuckles) King James, Gene.  Ving Rhames!  (microphone feedback hums)  Lunch announcements.  First up, from the Women's Issues club,  we have Peter and Zeke.  What's up, ladies!  Our main issue right now is that  no girls signed up for this club.  And Peter and I wrote a song about it. Hit it!  I don't have a vagina   But I won't stop try'na   Come on, girls! Help women with their issues   Okay, okay, okay.  Come on, girls, sign up right now!  Okay, okay, shutting it down.  Shutting it down.  Holy moly, that's it!  What's it? That's how we get our half day.  Join the Women's Issues club?  No. What if the day-before- Thanksgiving play is  so offensive that it gets shut down?  We'd all go home early.  Why would it be offensive? It's never offensive.  It's just bad and boring, like avocado toast.  But what if we could convince Mr. Frond  to let us do the play,  and then we make it so horrible and inappropriate  that he shuts it down?  Boom, half day. A real half day!  But where are we gonna find a play  that's inappropriate, offensive  and Thanksgiving-themed?  What's the most erotic temperature  you could cook a turkey at?  Thanks.  Oh, my God, Tina,  did you, uh, hear anything we were just talking about?  No. Great.  How's your Thanksgiving play going?  Oh, it's not a play.  It is now.  Peelin' the potatoes, tryin' not to fart   Thank you, Linda.  I'll just let out a little one   It's my little secret.   Oh, my God.  (gasps) Oh, my gosh!  I know. I have to live with you.  No, look at this potato.  Yeah? It looks like a face.  Oh, okay. (gasps)  It looks exactly like my grandfather.  Like, exactly. It does?  Yeah, my mother's father, Burt.  This is his spitting image, look.  I mean, don't all old men kind of look like potatoes?  It's even got the bumpy thing on its face in the same spot.  He used to put a nickel on the top of it,  and then I'd snatch it off.  Hmm, great.  All right, let's make fries.  No! Not with Grandpa.  Right. That'd be crazy.  You know what? I'm gonna keep him for a little while.  It'll be good for the kids to get to know my grandpa.  Potato. Grandpa Potato!  Yeah, Grandpa Potato.  I wasn't trying to name Forget it.  MR. FROND: So you want to put on  the Thanksgiving play this year?  What can we say?  I mean, you inspire us, Mr. Frond.  And I should probably just continue to do that.  This year, everyone will be reading  from an 88-stanza epic poem called ""The Pilgrims' Picnic.""  Oh, it sounds great, Mr. Frond.  Everyone likes stanzas.  I mean, they kind of do.  Right? Right?  You seem pretty confident.  After all, it's just your reputation no biggie.  Sounds like you don't need our play,  so see ya later. Uh  W-Well, just out of curiosity, what is your play?  It's called The Quirky Turkey.  It's based on an original short story by me.  Oh. Is it erotic?  Suggestive situations.  I'm cutting back on the implied nudity.  Okay, not a good start.  Picture this: an underdog story about a turkey.  An under-turkey. Who wears glasses.  It's a metaphor for self-esteem and community.  Ooh, I like that.  Yeah, we knew you would.  What about music? My plays always have music.  Makes the whole thing more musical.  And that's why we brought Gene on  as our musical director.  You did?  Oh. Yes, now I remember.  You absolutely did.  Mm, I'm still not entirely convinced.  That's because you have high standards,  and we love that.  And that's why we need you to be our executive producer.  Oh. What does an executive producer do?  Basically you accept awards and give interviews.  I-I can do that. I-I'd be great at that.  Yeah, you just say things like,  ""They said it would never work, but look at us now.""  Oh, that's good.  What if I said, ""This is a real passion project for me""?  Perfect. Nice.  Super cool.  So, uh, Mr. Frond, what do you say?  Belcher children, you have my permission  to put on The Quirky Turkey.  ALL: Yeah!  Let's get to quirk!  Welcome to the open casting call for the first ever  student-produced Thanksgiving play,  The Quirky Turkey!  This is your moment and your stage.  And also your lunchtime,  so remember to eat afterwards  or during your auditions, like I will be doing.  We're looking for the best of the best.  (quietly): Or the best at being worst.  Mm-hmm.  I can almost do the splits.  Almost. Ow.  Not quite. Ow. Ow!  Love it! Welcome aboard.  Look at this, look at that.  Look at this, look at this.  Look at that.  Look at this, look at that, look at this, look at this.  Okay, you got the part.  Thank you! LOUISE: Yup.  You were really good. Thank you, I know.  The lights are too bright! Can you turn them down?  Your future's even brighter, 'cause you're in the show!  I just came in here to see what everybody was doing.  Now I'm on stage. What's going on?  You got the part! That's what's going on.  Do what?  Ave   Maria.   Thank you. We'll let you know. Next!  Wait, Louise, what are you doing?  She's really good. Maybe she could play the lead.  Nah, nah, nah. She's not really what we're looking for.  Plus, we already know who's playing the Quirky Turkey.  It's you. What? Really?  You're perfect, Tina. And you know every word by heart.  And you've captured its dead-eyed stare.  But I'm the writer, too.  And I haven't even finished the second act.  Oh, we won't get that far.  What? Nothing, nothing.  You're doing great.  Gene, how's the music coming?  Psh. Man. So good.  TEDDY: Oh, yeah.  Looks just like him.  Same cheekbones.  Same steely look.  You see, Bob? Teddy sees it, too.  It's spooky.  But also comforting.  I miss Grandpa.  Aw, he never got to meet the kids.  'Cause he died.  Maybe I should make him a little blanket.  Oh, and a little cup of Jell-O. He loved Jell-O.  Hey, you could make him a little plate of mashed potatoes, too.  What are you talking about?  Uh, it-it was a joke.  Like, you know, old people and  mashed potatoes, 'cause they eat mashed potatoes,  and he's a potato. It's poor taste, Bob.  Yeah, too soon.  I'm gonna go into the kitchen.  Teddy, keep an eye on Grandpa Potato today.  Don't let Bob fry him up.  I'm not gonna fry up your grandfather.  You threw away that piece of toast  that looked like it said ""Wow.""  That was a dark day.  LOUISE: All right, folks!  Just a few days till curtains up.  Let's give them a show to remember.  Hey, T. How's my writer-slash-it-girl doing?  I don't know. I'm not feeling good  about the second act, but All right, fantastic.  I can't wait. Um, okay.  One more time from the top, Zeke.  Five, six, seven, eight!  (Jimmy Jr. and Zeke grunting)  I wish I wish I could be as graceful as you, J-Ju.  But I can't. Too stiff!  (grunts) Oh, God, I'm going down! Going down!  How are those harmonies coming, ladies?  Try this on for size.  Aah.   (same note): Aah.   No, no.  What? No.  Jocelyn, that's not a harmony. What?  It's not? No!  Do you even know what a harmony is?  A harmony is when I sing louder than you.  No! Oh.  I'm dizzy.  Keep up the good work.  So, how's this?  (plays riff) Good?  I mean, bad?  Bad-good? Good-bad?  I don't know. I mean, it's bad.  I mean, all of it's bad, but is it  ""shut down"" bad? Is it ""get a half day"" bad?  I guess something just happens when you get  in front of the hot lights.  It makes you want to leave your blood, sweat, tears  and pee out on the stage.  Oh, Gene. My Genie Gene!  You and your words and your stupid, stupid face.  I think I know how to guarantee that we get this play shut down!      So, Mr. Frond, you're the executive producer  of the Thanksgiving play, which premieres tomorrow.  Which I'm in. As an actor.  And I am, too, also.  Yes. I am the executive producer.  This was a real passion project for  Have you ever met the people from Bones?  Um, no Do you have a limousine?  No. I drive a hatchback.  Gross. Do  Do you guys want to talk about the play?  What play? Did you have plastic surgery?  Be real. No.  Do you want plastic surgery?  No. What? What?  If I were you, here's where I'd start.  Face. Back. What?  Front. Breath. (screams)  Okay, we're all set for tomorrow.  Our sweet, sweet half day is so close, I can taste it.  It tastes like victory, and nachos.  So, what's the plan again?  Ugh, Gene! It all happens after the first song  when the turkeys get killed.  Backstage, an air compressor will be attached to hoses,  which will be attached to bottles full of giblets  and gizzards, which will be inside the turkey heads.  When I hit this button, the turkey heads are gonna blow off  and giblets and gizzards are gonna go everywhere.  Like Carrie meets Gallagher meets Top Chef  meets Double Dare!  Exactly. All right, hands in the middle.  ""Get Frond to shut down Tina's horrible play  and get a half day"" on three!  BOTH: One, two, three  Get Get Frond to shut down  Louise! Gene! Oh! Tina! (screams)  H-How long have you been standing there?  Long enough!  Why is my hand like this?  We don't even do this in our family.  Do we play sports now, too?  If the sport is lying and ruining my play,  yeah, I guess you do! So, I am an athlete!  So, this was your plan all along?  You're just using me and my play?  Tina, I'm sorry you had to find out this way.  Gene, when you said, ""Tina, your play's got the goods,""  and you said ""goods"" like it had a ""Z"" at the end,  that was just a bunch of crap?  I never should have put that ""Z"" on the end.  That's my biggest regret in all of this ""mezz.""  I came in here to tell you guys that I finally,  maybe, sort of finished the big heartfelt musical number  in act two, and now you're saying that none of that  even matters? Hey.  Save the drama for the stage, Tina C. Williams!  Yeah, don't get your pubes in a tube.  I will get my pubes in a tube.  We should all get our pubes in a tube.  'Cause Louise and Gene are gonna ruin the whole play  by dumping gizzards and giblets all over the stage  so Mr. Frond will shut down the play!  (all gasp, murmur)  Okay, okay, just calm down.  There is a completely reasonable explanation for all of this.  Yeah. You don't care about the play.  All you care about is if the play gets shut down  and we get a half day!  ALL: Oh.  A half day? I'd be into that.  I'm as angry as you are! Wait, what?  Yeah, a half day doesn't sound half bad.  Hell yeah! I wouldn't mind getting home early, too.  And I want to go to the mall that day to get leggings.  Yeah, for her legs. Yes.  Well, Tina, looks like everyone wants to go  to Shutdown Town except for you.  But we've all worked so hard.  Have we? And I've worked hard  getting a whole bunch of giblets and gizzards.  People don't want to sell that stuff to a nine-year-old.  Look, it'll all be worth it tomorrow  when you're sitting on the couch, back in your PJs  at 11:00 a.m., staring down a four-day weekend.  So, what do you say?  You ready to tank this turkey?  Um, I guess.  Yeah. If everyone else wants to do it.  All right, so it's settled.  The show must go off!  See everyone tomorrow.  LINDA: Just doin' something   Over here.   Uh, Lin. What are you doing?  What? Oh, um, nothing.  Are you putting Grandpa Potato in your bag  to bring to school?  What? No!  That would be ridiculous.  (chuckles): It's a potato.  I'm a grown woman.

Shh, keep it down. He's trying to watch the show.  Why can't I be like the other turkeys?   They're all off having fun   Is it 'cause I'm scrawny and have glasses   And rather smallish buns?   There he is   My crush   The most handsome pig, what a rush   (keyboard plays drumroll) Yeah!

You looking at the kids' Christmas lists again?  Binders, Lin.  They put them in binders this year.  I-I think we need to explain to them what ""poor"" means.  You're putting too much pressure on yourself.

It's a shame I can only wear  this sweater four months out of the year.  (phone rings) Bob's Burgers.  Bob. It's your favorite landlord, Calvin Fischoeder.  Oh hi, Mr. Fischoeder.  Bob, I need you to deliver some food to my house.  I'm having a little party, nothing weird,  so just bring whatever.  Mr. Fischoeder, actually, I'm about to go  caroling with my family, so  What? Why? Never mind.  Bob, I don't want to play the landlord card here,  but actually, I do.  Oh, okay. How much food do you need?  Oh, I don't know. Just just bring  five or six foods. Over and out.  So, Mr. Fischoeder wants me to bring food over to his house.  He's having a party.  Nothing weird, he said, which is troubling.  Ugh! It's definitely a human sacrifice party.  Or a sensual grown-up party.  Dad, you need a Venetian mask and a thong, stat!  Stop it. â­Aw, Bob.  What about caroling?  Well, we'll just drop off some burgers,  and then we'll go afterwards. (coughs)  You're getting sacrificed. â­Oh!  Bob would be great at getting sacrificed.  He's got the body for it.  Mm-hmm.    Okay, I'll be right back.  And they never saw him again.  FELIX: What's the password?  Uh, it's Bob. I'm just here  to drop off some food.  That's not it. Felix, let me in.  Okay, fine, but if anyone asks,  you totally knew the password was  ""pee-pee, poo-poo, one, two, three, four.""  They're all down in the dungeon.  It's what we call the basement.  Oh, boy.    Oh, God. Please don't be something horrible.  Oh, they're gonna cover me with candy and eat me.  Bob!  Welcome to the Gingerbread Gentlemen's  Annual Gingerbread House Competition.  Everyone, meet this year's guest competitor, Bob.  Hello. â­Hello. â­Hello.  I don't understand.  I'm just here to drop off the food.  (laughing): Oh, Bob.  You're always doing that confused  food delivery man business.  (stammers) And I get why it's hysterical.  Now, come with me, and let's, uh,  get you into your tuxedo. Come, come, come  Mr. Fischoeder, what is going on?  Hey. â­Listen.  How are you at building  gingerbread houses?  Well, actually, not bad.  My mom and I used to build them together  before she died. It was kind of our thing  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, okay.  Forget about all that, because I want you  to enter this contest, and lose.  What? Why? Because every year,  every damn year, I lose.  You wouldn't think it by the looks of them,  but those men out there  (stuttering): those, there are, so  Well, they are some creative bastards.  O-Okay. I should really get going.  Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup But, oh, hey, uh, okay.  Where is he? All right, while we're waiting, let's warm up.  Now repeat after me: Ang-ang-ang-ang-ang.  ALL: Ang-ang-ang-ang-ang-ang-ang.  (groans) Mr. Fischoeder, I  can't Felix lose for you? What? No!  He wishes. Only the eldest son  in each founding family is allowed to compete.  Well, then, why would I be allowed to compete?  Because I'm the host this year, and the host  is allowed to pick one guest competitor.  I mean, uh, generally they're  they're a lot richer and cleaner than you,  but I-I only had this idea a couple of hours ago,  so, well, here we are. As far as those guys are concerned,  you're my wealthy, woolly buddy. Uh, listen, sorry,  but I'm supposed to go caroling with my family.  (grumbles) You keep saying that.  It's so strange.  Hey, what if you don't have to pay  the rent next month? â­Huh.  Mm-hmm. â­We could use the money  to get better Christmas presents for the kids.  That's not what I'd do, but sure.  Okay. Okay, I-I'll do it.  Fantastic! And and you're okay  with being killed when you lose?  What? â­Oh, I'm just kidding.  Ha. Ha. â­Ha. Or am I?  (laughs) I am.  Mr. Fischoeder wants you to lose a gingerbread house contest?  But we need your beautiful soprano voice.  We need it to do the song  ""You Can't Spell Christmas Without Us.""  It's a classic.  I mean, I'm not a soprano, but if I do this,  we won't have to pay rent next month.  (quietly): And we can use that money to buy  you-know-whats for the you-know-whos.  (quietly): Who are the you-know-whos?  (whispers): Yeah, who are they?  Hey, Whispering Willies, I'm going with Dad.  I want to see this gingerbread competition madness.  Me, too. â­Yeah, Dad, we could cheer you on.  Like ""Dad, Dad, he's our man.  If he can't do it, that's good.""  No, kids. Y-You go with your mom.  Caroling will be fun, too.  Okay, well, sold me.  I bought it. Kids, I want you to know  I'm not trying to replace your father while we're caroling.  But if you so choose, you may call me Caroling Dad.  Thanks, Teddy. â­All right.  Well, we'll go caroling around this neighborhood  and then we'll meet you back here, Bob. â­Okay.  Good luck losing, Dad!  You're in your element.  Do I, uh, look all right?  Yeah. I mean, there's nothing we can do about your face.  And your hair. â­Hmm.  So, how-how do you want me to lose? â­Simple.  If your house falls down, it's disqualified.  So, just build it really tall and extremely unstable,  like-like, some of my properties.  What? Well, (clears throat)  Not your place. (chuckles)  Yeah, you're fine. Anyway, right before the end,  down goes your house, the judge declares a winner  and a loser, which won't be me, and bing.  It's over. (opens door)  The judge? What-what judge?  Godfrey the same guy who's been  judging this thing since the beginning.  BOB: Wow. He is old.  Is he alive?  That's a good question. Let's find out.  (yelling): Godfrey!  (shrieks) â­There he is.  (shrieks)  Now, let's introduce everyone.  This is August Scharffenheimer.  We all call him Auggie.  (German accent): I do not like it.  And this is downtown Randolph Brackenbrown.  BOB: Wow, You are  really arching your eyebrow.  Yes, I'm in fierce competition mode.  Also, it's a medical thing.  I can't always lower it  (straining): when I want to.  And finally,  Samuel Summerbottom.  I like my houses like I like my women  sturdy and ginger.  Okay. And Bob, as you know, I'm Felix,  and I'm not jealous of you at all.  (laughs) Isn't that nice?  So, Bob, just put your guns on the gun table, and we can begin.  Oh, I, I didn't bring any guns.  No guns. Okay. Interesting. Well,  let's get started. Haven't you forgotten something?  We can't really start until last year's loser  puts on the loser hat.  (groans)  Calvin has to wear it every year.  It's an old bed pan.  It's very shameful. (laughs)  (mocking laughter) BOB: Yikes.    Wow. Mr. Fischoeder's neighborhood  really is beautiful.  Yeah. (whistles)  Whoa, except for that poor thing.  LINDA: Oh yeah, what's going on with that? Ugh.  Oh, man, I know that place.  I've heard crazy stories about the guy that lives there.  Stories not suitable for children.  Like what, Teddy? Okay, I'll tell you.  See all those bedsheets  up in the windows?  He puts those up there  to hide his evil deeds.  Bathroom stuff? â­Murder!  Huh. â­His parents used to live there with him.  But where are they now? â­Florida?  Murdered! A delivery man went in there once,  never came out. What happened to him?  They got married? Murdered!  Aah They say he buried them all in the backyard,  and then he just went right on murdering.  Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder hello, sir murder!  All right, Teddy, you convinced me, let's go there.  No! What? The murder! The murder part.  Teddy, stop with your stories. You're ruining the vibe.  Come on, let's go carol the crap out of this place!  Yeah! I came here for hot chocolate, not not chocolate.  FISCHOEDER: I got to say, gentlemen,  I'm feeling good about this year.  Tell that to your potty head.  Ha! Classic ginger boom.  Ha, ha, ha. Felix!  I need more frosting.  Coming! Here we go.  Frosting, Calvin?  More like losting.  Ha! Another incredible ginger boom.  (nervous laughs)  Uh, look at Bob  that's bad, right?  His whole deal? Ugh!  Uh. Okay. So, what's, uh,  everybody's Christmas plans?  I was going to buy an island and flip it. Literally.  I'm going to have my cash washed and waxed.  It really needs it.  I'm going to treat myself to a new penis.  Okay. So no one's spending it with family?  No way. Ha. â­Nope. â­No.  Wait, what about your brother, Felix?  Oh, right. Him.  Oh, uh, look! I have this, uh, extra plate under my arm.  Maybe I could just, uh, join you guys  Felix, no!  All right, here I go.  Oh, I can't wait for that prize to be mine.  There's a prize?  You didn't know? We chipped in  and made an obscenely large donation  to the Bog Harbor Zoo to procure  a private Christmas Day cuddle session  with Amity the albino polar bear cub.  He's the ""it"" bear right now.  He's so fuzzy.  Wow. My kids would love that.  Why? â­Uh, because  kids love baby animals?  I don't think that's right. Uh, they, they do.  Why do you guys want to cuddle a polar bear?  An albino polar bear cub cuddle  is a very prestigious cuddle, Bob.  I've cuddled a rhino baby, a tiger baby,  and now I may cuddle an albino polar bear baby.  That's such a good order to do it in.  Thank you. Pay no attention to Bob, everybody.  He's not smart ginger boom.  He's also pear-shaped ginger boom.  If a pear could be dumb and bad at things.  Ha, ha. You know what I mean? (chortles)  A dumb pear. Pears are the worst.  (singing ""Deck the Halls"") Fa la la la la, la la la la.   Okay. Thank you.  And we will take our hot cocoa now.  So, thank you.  Sorry, I don't have any. BOTH: What?!  Cider? No.  Cinnamon? Afraid not.  What about hot cocoa?  Again, no.  Damn it! Then we don't have  any caroling for you, pal.  Well, I mean, you already did it.  Oh, did we? Yeah, we did.  (out of sync):  Fa la la la la la la la la   Okay, good night, then.  No, no, no, no. Now you join in.  Oh, uh  Hark, the angel Harold sings   Grab your coats. Come on out.  Whoops, the door is closing.  About all the Christmas things   Okay, bye-bye, then. Everybody.  Peace on earth and salsa mild   La la la la  MAN: Uh, great.  Wait. Come with us. Join our Christmas Crusade!  I just want to shut this on you.  Unh. Aw, sugar plumbs! (lights sizzle)  Um, where are all the candy wafers?  Auggie, you're hogging them aren't you?  You're a hoggie Auggie.  Look who's talking, Mr. Too Many Jelly Fruit Slices.  Samuel, what are you building with those mini marshmallows?  Oh, just a mini snowman.  Damn, that's brilliant.  So you're just sticking peppermints everywhere, then?  Uh, yeah. It's uh, some ornamental filigree.  Bob, I got to say your gingerbread scoring  is exquisite. Oh, uh, thank you.  You just got to be firm but gentle.  Show us. Um, okay.  I don't think that's necessary.  Potty head, shush. Mmm  Ah, so firm but so gentle.  Uh-huh. And does your big fat belly  get in the way, Bob?  Uh, no, it-it doesn't.  And what about your body odor, Bob?  Do you find that distracting?  I mean, it's like your armpits threw up.  Whoa! Oh, my.  Uh, okay, easy.  You smell like a stevedore's shorts.  You smell like failure.  Like stinky failure farts.  Okay, that's it. Calvin, can I have a word with you  in the other room? Sure.  Look, I'm doing you a favor, Mr. Fischoeder.  You can't treat me like this.  What's the matter, Bob,  can't handle my garbage mouth?  You mean trash talk?  Trash talk, garbage mouth, ginger booms  It's all the same thing.  And it's part of the gingerbread game, Bob,  so get used to it.  Well, get used to this!  I'm gonna take you down.  I'm gonna try to win this thing.  My kids would love that polar bear cuddle.  That would be an amazing Christmas present!  What? No, no. We have a deal.  The deal's off, Mr. Fischoeder.  Oh, and do you know who's going to lose this contest?  You are, potty head!  How's that for garbage mouth?  Pretty good, actually. Wait, Bob, come back.  Auggie, pass me the gumdrops.  AUGGIE: Okay. You don't have to shout.  RANDOLPH: Uh-oh, looks lik someone's re-jigger-breading.  And with so little time left.  Pretty ballsy, Bob.  Well, I had this sudden inspiration,  and I'm gonna go for it,  since I'm in it to win it.  Ah, that is such a cool expression.  Think about what you're doing, Bob.  Oh, I have thought about it.  Well, have you thought about this?  Ow! Stop pinching my thigh.  Stop putting your thigh between my fingers.  (grunting) â­Oh, the thrills  of gingerbread house competition.  LINDA: What's wrong with these people?  A bunch of Christmas crumb bums.  Aw, maybe we should just pack it in.  Go home and drink the kind of hot cocoa that's wine.  Wait, if we're not gonna get any cocoa,  the only thing that's gonna make this worthwhile  is going to that creepy, dark house.  No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.  I-I got stuff to live for.  I have a pair of pants on layaway at the mall.  Doesn't anyone want to check out  this crazy killer? I mean,  bring Christmas spirit to this poor guy.  You're right. Okay, let's do it.  But if we get murdered, don't tell your father.  Fine, go. I'll be right behind you.  Protecting you, in the back, where it's safe.  Okay, I'll just ring the bell.  Huh.  Guess he's not home. â­Hello.  (screaming)  Okay, Bob, you got this. Ow!  A chance to give your kids the best Christmas ever.  No pressure. Ow!  Just ignore Mr. Fischoeder. Ow!  Oh, is this not helpful?  Hey, where did all the tiny  candy canes go? Auggie!  What? I needed them for my tiny candy cane trees.  But how the hell will my ""candy cripples"" walk?  Wait, there was one chocolate Santa left.  I need him. I need chocolate Santa!  Oh, I may have eaten him.  You son of a bitch! (alarm chiming)  Aah! Time's up. Contest over.  Oh, nuts!  Why did we hide instead of keep running?  I don't know. I panicked.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This is how we die.  I knew it. I knew it was gonna be like this I'm sorry.  Mom, you're great in a crisis.  There you are. (all scream)  Wait. Please don't run away again.  Sorry about the knife. I was chopping hazelnuts  for a winter salad.  You're carolers, right? I love carolers.  Love killing them, or What?  Nothing. â­Okay great talk, bye.  No. We are carolers,  and we will sing for you, right? Right?  Ah, great.  Why don't you come a little closer  so I can hear you better?  LINDA: Uh, sure  (all muttering)  A little closer.  (all groaning)  Boy, you guys are some small-stepping carolers, huh?  Thanks.  Judging, judging  Auggie, if I don't win, it's on you.  Oh, is that right, Randolph,  the Big-Nose Crybaby?  What about you, you Santa snacker?  He was delicious!  You are so lucky all my guns are  on the gun table, and I'm not concealing any weapons.  So are you, mister.  (all three grunting)  Here we go. Aah, what's happening?  We're pointing guns at each other's  gingerbread houses, obviously.  Come on, Bob, keep up.  Where were you even hiding that?  Let's just say I have  a high butt crack.  Well, if everybody's doing it, whoop!  Ha ha. Aah!  Felix, don't you grab a gun.  We're having a moment here.  You think you're so great, Calvin,  just because you came out of Mommy's hootenanny before me!  Everybody just calm down. I mean, come on,  it's just a stupid gingerbread house contest.  OTHERS: What?! Aah! Don't point at me.  Back at the houses. Back at the houses!  In a one-horse open sleigh   LINDA: Okay, good night. ALL: Bye.  Wait, do you know this one? LINDA: What?  (singing in falsetto voice): Adeste Fideles   Laeti triumphantes   Venite, venite   In Bethlehem   Maybe Bob's right. This is silly.  We should put our guns away.  Yeah. â­Yeah. â­Uh-huh.  Or, counterpoint.  MAN (singing):  Natum videte   Regem angelorum   Venite adoremus   Venite adoremus   Venite   Adoremu-uuus   Dominum.   Nice pipes.  Uh, thanks. I'm Oscar. Care for some hot cocoa?  Uh-huh. â­Yes, please. â­Sure.  Well, it finally happened.  We finally shot up  each other's gingerbread houses.  I'm honestly surprised it took until this year.  (laughs) Well, I just got to say  thanks so much for inviting me to your competition,  where I was almost a casualty  in a gingerbread massacre!  Calm down. Yeah, take a chill pill.  Y-You know why I'm even here?  Because I'm Mr. Fischoeder's tenant,  and he said I wouldn't have to pay rent next month  if I lost on purpose. â­He's lying.  Huh, that's actually a pretty good idea.  Yeah. Innovative thinking.  Really? Well, then, he's right.  Sick of always being the loser, huh, Calvin?  Yes, I am. Every year I try,  and every year, a potty head.  It's a lot of pressure.  Look, I-I understand.  This time of year can be hard.  I'm under a lot of pressure myself  trying to figure out how to give my kids  a good Christmas.  Oh, not that again. Please, Bob,  I'm talking about real pressure.  Oh, my God.  And Bob's house is the least destroyed.  So I guess, uh, Bob wins.  Oh, my God.  So, yeah, in hindsight,  maybe covering all the windows with bed sheets  wasn't the best idea.  I thought I was just being frugal and creative.  I guess that kind of stuff does get the rumor mill grinding.  The rumor mill.  People love to talk, you know.  (chuckles) But they don't always have the facts.  Huh, Tina? Lookin' at you. â­What?  Well, Oscar, anyone with a voice like yours  can't be a murderer.  And even if you are,  you're still okay in my book.  So are you? I mean, you can tell us.  We're cool.  Uh, no, I'm not.  Damn. â­You did kill those high notes.  Ooh, Oscar, go caroling with us.  Oh, and we can finally do the song,  ""You Can't Spell Christmas Without Us.""  You can be our soprano.  (gasps): I'd love to.  Great, but no killing us, okay?  (chuckles)  Aah, he's got a chain saw! No, it's just his mug.  I can't believe I won. Oh, quit gloating.  Hey, does that mean the rest of us lost?  Yep, you're all tied for last place.  Well, there's some good news.  We're all losers.  This is all Bob's fault.  He called the competition stupid,  and I just went into a blind rage.  Same here.  What you said was really hurtful, Bob.  Yeah, they're called feelings, Bob, look it up.  (sighs): You guys, I don't really think it's stupid.  I actually think this whole thing is kind of sweet.  You get together every year, you build gingerbread houses.  You even donated to a zoo. It's nice.  I mean, under that rich-loner exterior,  you're all a bunch of softies who care about each other.  You're like a weird little family.  Even me?  Uh, yeah, sure, even you, Godfrey.  I'm the fun one.  And I mean, it may sound cheesy,  but you know what the greatest gift of all is?  Family. â­Oh, barf. Sounds cheesy.  Um, I'm Calvin's actual family.  Just, uh, want to point that out.  Hey, maybe next year,  we don't even have to pick a loser, hmm?  That's the best part. No, we're still doing that.  That stays.  Well, until next year, gentlemen.  What is that awful racket? (muffled singing)  Because we can't spell Christmas   Without us.   RANDOLPH: Should we shoot them?  (laughter, fawning)  No wonder the ice caps are melting,  this bear is hot.  I changed my mind about having kids.  I'm gonna have one, and feed it to this bear,  'cause I love him so much.  He's so cute, but it'd be really hard to get stains off him.  Ah, best Christmas ever, Bob.  Oh, I want to pet him. I want to pet him.  Yeah, can we have our turn now?  Thanks again for letting us come, Bob.  Get ready for the cuddle bug.  You know, Bob, that family of yours,  they're, uh, they're lucky to have you.  Thanks, Mr. Fischoeder.  Okay, now you say something nice about me.  You have pretty eye?  Sounds like a line, Bob,  but Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mr. Fischoeder.  LINDA:  I can spell Christmas without a U   But that would break my heart in two   You can spell Christmas without me   But that would be a tragedy   We need S and U's this time of year   Because   Because we can't spell Christmas   Without ""us.""   Because we can't spell Christmas   Without ""us.""   MAN: Thank you."
"1   - (Tina groaning) - LOUISE: Tina, why are you wearing those?  You can't walk now.  You couldn't walk so good before.  They're my platform beach espadrilles. Remember?  The big Eighth Grade Beach Bonfire is this weekend.  With any luck, Jimmy Junior and I  will be sharing a blanket and maybe more blanket.  - If it gets cold. - Mm.  Sometimes, Jimmy Junior doesn't look at me when I'm talking,  or listen to me, so I thought it might help  if I was closer to his face.  Mm-hmm. Guys like it  when you're just right in their face.  Ah! They probably work better in sand.  Hi, guys. Looking forward to the beach bonfire?  More like bond-fire.  We're gonna roast wienies and get all philosophical  about growing up, and then start hugging and stuff.  - Oh. Ow! - Ha-ha! Get over here!  - Zeke, let go. Ah, Zeke! - Get over here!  So, Jimmy Junior,  I hear some people are going to the bonfire as a couple.  Yeah, but most kids are going in a big group.  Cool, big group. Hey, back to that couple idea,  maybe we could go early and get some sticks pre-marshmallowed.  Really hit the ground running?  Uh  So that's a great idea ""uh""?  Uh  You'll get back to me ""uh"" Got it.  See ya.  So, from down here, that didn't look  like it went great.  (sighs) It's fine.  I'm just gonna walk away, my head held high.  I'm okay.  So I'm not okay.  No, it's a bad sprain.  You mind if I fool around with it a little bit?  I want to kind of get in there.  Um, maybe I'll just take some crutches  and get out of your hair. (grunts)  Hey, I'm back from the thrift store.  Did you say good-bye to our old clothes?  Were they sad?  I think they were happy to be back.  I forgot, we bought them there.  Anyway, while I was there, I happened to see this guy.  Ooh, an old banjo case. What's inside?  Oh, a banjo.  What are you gonna do with it?  Learn to play.  Look, it has a strap so I can keep it back here,  and then I'm always ready to pull it around,  'cause you never know when there's gonna be a  banjo moment.  What the heck's a ""banjo moment""?  Any moment of time that would be slightly better  with banjo music.  Huh. Uh  They happen. I mean, not right now,  'cause I don't like how you're interrogating me.  What?  (sighs) I'm just gonna put my banjo back in here  and go into the kitchen.  Oh, there's a song there.  Someone's in the kitchen with the banjo   Tina, I heard the fantastic news about your ankle.  Thanks, Mr. Frond.  Wait, ""fantastic"" news?  Yes! Recently, we were approached by a tech company,  Yo 'Botics Robotics.  They're looking for a student to participate  in a robotic mobility pilot program  Or RUMP for short.  RUMP? I'm listening.  It's a way for mobility-impaired kids  to go to school without going to school!  - How does it work? - I don't know, Tina.  Do I look like Bill Gates?  Yes, a little.  Well, thank you.  Anyway, you're the perfect candidate.  And I'll be the guy who brought robots to Wagstaff,  which is some sweet resume candy. (chuckles)  Even better than Eighth Grade Beach Bonfire chaperone.  Which, by the way, I am.  Oh, congratulations.  So, what about RUMP?  They can get you up and running tomorrow, so to speak.  I don't know, I'm pretty good with these crutches.  They go under your arm.  They what?  They go under your arm.  You have your arm through them.  Oh. Hey, that's way more comfortable.  MAN: Okay, Tina,  we're seeing you here.  Are you seeing us there?  I see you. Hi.  All right, now, uh, try rotating left.  Mm-kay, here it goes.  Doing it.  Uh, no. Rotate the robot.  With your joystick.  Oh. Got it.  Mm.  Sorry that a smarter kid didn't get injured.  Um, we can hear you, Mr. Frond.  Oh, um, good microphone.  I know a guidance counselor who's gonna get injured.  Well, I can hear you.  Guys, there are microphones.  This is how they work.  Tina, why don't you go ahead and test that joystick,  and we'll get you off to class.  Ow! Damn it! Son of a bitch!  Oh, sorry!  It's fine.  Uh, go ahead and try again.  Ah! Ah! My leg!  I'm pinned!  Uh, sorry, um  Back up! Back up!  Like this? Um  No! You're still going forward!  So this is going pretty well.  It feels kind of like my first day of school.  - How do I look? - You look good.  But I still kind of wonder what else is on.  You're too skinny. Eat a battery or something.  ZEKE: Whoa, there it is.  Watch out, mankind.  Ugh, Tina's a robot.  Look at me, look at me, I'm a robot.  Exactly, that's exactly what she's doing.  Hi, guys. Hi, Jimmy Junior.  Uh, hi.  Hi, Tina.  This thing is not Tina, Jocelyn.  It's microchips and a bunch of stupid wires.  It's a clever lie!  Sorry, not personal.  I just don't care for bots.  Well, guess I should roll along to class. (chuckles nervously)  Me, too. Uber me to Room Six?  Room Ten for me.  Out of the way, out of the way! Move it!  TEDDY: You look great with a banjo, Bob.  You're like a ethnic Steve Martin.  - Yeah. - Uh, thanks.  Play something.  Okay. I'll try.  I mean, it's my first day with this thing, so  (playing rapidly)  Holy cow, you're a natural!  I guess I am.  Yahoo!  Linda, you're married to that guy! Wow!  Everybody, get in here! You got to hear this!  It's a banjo moment. I get it now.  I'm so good at the banjo!  - So, still tuning? - (plays single note)  No, it's the song.  That's the song?  I mean, I think it's the song.  It's just, there's a lot of time in between the notes.  I like it.  I mean, it's not, like, too much, you know?  Like, too much song?  No, it's not.  Coming through.  - Watch your toes. Sorry. - Ow!  Ow!  - Sorry. - (laughter)  Something funny?  Guess I missed it. Ah!  Cool locker. Like what you've done to it.  Yeah, whatever, robot.  - Um, um, um - (motor grinding)  - (school bell rings) - Can I get a little help?  Help, some can I get a little help, someone?  (sighs)  Sharif he don't like it, boom boom boom.   Hey, who left out this AV cart?  Mr. Branca, I'm not an AV cart. I'm Tina.  Rock the Casbah   Rock the boom boom.   No, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't put me in the AV closet!  Thinks it's not kosher.   No!  I hate being a robot.  I'm sure they'll come looking for me.  I'll give it another half hour.  Come on, seriously?  (snorts angrily)  I'm not you, I'm me, Dad!  (grunts)  TINA: Um, hello?  Who-who's there?  What? Who said that?  Me. Over here.  (grunts)  Tina?  Oh. Hi, Jimmy Junior.  What are you doing here?  Oh, I had a fight with my dad this morning.  He said I have to go to speech therapy instead of dance club.  ""I don't need speech therapy, Dad.  You need dance therapy!""  - I'm sorry. - So I just needed to go someplace  to spin things out!  If you want to be alone, I can power down.  No, that's okay. Why are you here?  Mr. Branca thought I was an AV cart.  I guess we're both misunderstood.  Yeah. We have thoughts and feelings, people.  Yeah. I mean, I knew I did. I didn't know you did.  Tina, you're really easy to talk to as a robot.  Thanks. I guess it's kind of like talking on the phone.  Like, how you can say anything to a telemarketer,  even your deepest, darkest secrets.  I've done that.  (school bell rings)  Well, I guess we have P.E. now.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, should we just ditch and talk?  Yes! Uh, I-I mean, talk away. I'm all ears.  Well, (chuckles) all microphone. You get it.  Not really.  So, like, what's your desert island dance?  Mine's probably the Russian thing where you squat and kick,  like this. (grunting)  You know, sometimes I feel like I just notice things, you know?  Like how trees are really just giant plants.  - Oh, yeah. - (scoffs) Yeah.  Uh-oh, that's my low-power warning.  I want to keep talking, but I'm at three percent battery.  Wow, we missed fifth period. We talked for hours.  Yeah, we totally binge talked.  Can, um can I walk you home?  Uh, the robot lives at school,  but you can walk me to the charging station.  Ah! I'm at one percent! Let's go! Move, move!  Maybe being a robot isn't so bad.  I just had my best conversation ever with Jimmy Junior.  And it's not like the bar was set low at all.  Did I tell you the thing about trees?  Yeah, that they're like plants?  - Giant plants. - Yeah.  Anyway, school's over, and Gene and I were wondering  if we could take the robot out for a test drive.  Don't worry, we'll keep it under five miles per hour, Pops.  Unless it goes over that. Does it, perchance?  Um, I'm really the only one  that's supposed to use the robot.  Sorry, guys.  Tina, that is not a problem.  We asked, you gave us an answer.  We respect that.  I kind of hate myself for even asking Tina.  (quietly): Wagstaff after dark.  LOUISE: Okay, what should we do first?  Bump things off Mr. Frond's desk?  Do donuts in the library?  GENE: See if Coach Blevins  is really living under the bleachers since his divorce?  Well, we got all night.  (Louise and Gene gasp)  The security guard.  - Huh? - He's coming this way.  What do we do?  Whoa.  (robotic voice): Hello, human security guard.  Any trouble in the halls tonight?  Well, everything was pretty quiet  till I saw you, robot gizmo thing.  I think I better call this in.  (robotic voice): Don't bother.  I come from headquarters.  I'm the cyber security guard.  What's your name, bro?  Yuli.  Yuli, you seem great.  But we cannot be friends, because I am your supervisor.  Wait, what?  You mean, ""Wait, what, sir?""  Wait, what, sir? Wait, what, sir?  - Sir, sir, sir. - Sorry, I-I got it.  I'm sorry. Sir, yes.  Don't worry, I'm fun to work for.  Oh, good. I'm fun to employ.  This might work out.  Now go to the cafeteria,  grab three dozen peanut butter cookies  and slide them through the little slats in the door  of locker 412.  And 319.  Eh, I don't think  peanut butter cookies will fit through there.  Make them fit!  Okay, okay. Geez!  Seriously, Bob? In bed?  So, not a banjo moment?  Let me check. No.  (chuckles) Good night.  Night.  Bob, I swear to God!  I'm sorry, I thought you were asleep.  I waited.  - Bob. - Yep.  Tina-Bot, come into the AV closet.  I-I want to show you something.  It's something I haven't shown anyone, not even Zeke.  A secret and a ""Zeke-ret""? Wow.  Um, I've been working on some poems, you know,  about my life and kind of, like, things I'm going through.  Poems? Life? Going through? Yes.  And I got this idea to put poems and music together.  Like songs?  No, ""musoems.""  Oh, right.  Here's the first one.  Dad, I used your cologne   'Cause you won't buy me my own.   And here's another one.  Cars   All the different cars.   And then there's  My mom's new friend Allen   He's okay.   So I'm still working on that one.  Breakfast!   That one's about breakfast.  And then, um  What if God's name was Todd?   So you, like, start a new one before finishing one?  Uh well, no.  Like, three of the ones I sang to you are finished.  Like, the cars is finished.  Lunch delivery. Tina, want some tuna?  Can you knock?  I'm in the AV closet with Jimmy Junior.  What? What are you doing in the closet?  We're having an intimate conversation  and connecting deeply. God!  Hi, Jimmy Junior.  Uh, hi, Mrs. Belcher.  (sniffs) Smells funny in here. I think it's you.  How long since you left the room?  Mom, just go!  All right, I'm going, I'm leaving.  Have fun spending time together, sort of.  Watching you from a distant place   I'm calling you from my home base   My satellite's spinning right out of control   Transmission to the moon, now my message is go   And the moon is so cold, it's so cold   I can see food on your face   Watching you   Uch, it's just like, get a computer room already.  Man, that bot's wrapped him around her little wheels.  You know, she's probably using A.I. on him.  Wait, A.I. like, ""As if""?  Yeah. As if.  Oh, my God.  I know.  You two are making me feel smart.  Tina, Jimmy Junior's at the door.  She might be a sec.  (panting)  Hi, Jimmy Junior.  You came down the stairs like The Exorcist.  Miss Jacobson wanted me to give you this for homework.  Oh, great.  So, here it is.  It's been a while since we've seen each other in person.  Yeah, it-it has.  So  So  Any new ""musoems""?  I'm gonna go.  Oh, okay. Good talk.  Not really.  I didn't see that.  It was a little embarrassing, but I didn't see it.  God, Mom!  Banjo? (strums banjo)  - Dad, no. - Bob, no.  Okay. I'll check back in at another time.  That's odd. I should be fully charged this morning,  but I'm only at 20% power.  (yawns) Weird.  It's not like the robot is running around all night,  doing really fun stuff.  Exactly.  All right, who put  20 basketballs in my supply closet?  - (Louise laughs) - Hey.  Oh, hi, Jimmy Junior.  Hey, did yesterday seem awkward to you? 'Cause  Listen, I've decided I'm gonna perform my ""musoems""  for everyone at the bonfire.  But I need you there, as my date.  Oh, wow. That-that's fantastic.  I mean, my crutches might be  a little tricky in the sand, but I  Your crutches?  Yeah, those things that go under my armpits.  I call them ""pit sticks.""  Wait, Jimmy Junior, are you asking me or the robot?  The robot.  But I don't think of you as a robot.  I think of you as almost a real person.  So, what do you say?  Um  Okay. It's a date.  Great. Bye.  Hey, that worked out.  You're going to the bonfire.  Uh, yeah, huh.  I guess we're going robot dress shopping.  I've said that so many times and it's finally true!  So, Jimmy Junior doesn't like me as me.  He likes me as a robot. I can work with that.  No relationship is perfect, right?  Uh, a lot of girls have it worse.  Yeah, look at mom.  The important thing is I'm going to the bonfire.  It'll be my voice and my image right there on the beach.  Wait a minute. How do I get the robot to the beach?  It's not even supposed to leave school. Oh, no!  Tina, we know some people who might be able to help you.  (quietly): It's us.  So, uh, where's the banjo?  I'm thinking of taking it back to the thrift store, actually.  Oh, forget about making that burger to-go.  I will eat it here.  Oh, God, I'm so relieved. (chuckles)  I guess what I'm hearing is  you're not gonna try and talk me out of this.  (laughs) Well, let's put it this way.  People don't come to Bob's Burgers for the music, you know?  Yeah.  It's called Bob's Burgers, not Bob's Banjo.  - Uh-huh. - (laughs)  It was more ""grueling"" banjo, than ""dueling"" banjo. (laughs)  All right, Teddy, you made your point.  Geez, why you getting so hot? You're terrible at the banjo.  LINDA: Big beach bonfire  - tonight, huh? - Uh-huh.  So, you're going, but you're not going,  'cause you're staying here,  but Jimmy Junior's going and you're gonna do  the thing with the robot?  What part of ""virtual robot date"" don't you understand?  It just seems a little unhealthy.  Mom, I have a relationship now!  A-And, yes, I've stopped changing socks and underwear,  and, yes, it smells funny in here.  But, sweetie, this can't last.  You got to step out from behind the robot  and go back to school next week.  Unless you twist your other ankle or something.  Twist my other ankle. Interesting.  Tina, do not twist your other ankle  just to keep this wackadoodle thing going.  It's not wackadoodle!  Now, excuse me,  but I've got to check my battery level,  stretch my joystick hand,  and get dressed above the shoulders.  Okay, okay, have fun.  Be home by Never mind.  You're in good hands, T.  Now, which way is the door?  Hey, slow down there, R-Poo-D-Poo.  A security guard!  Don't worry. This guy's a pussycat.  (robotic voice): How's it going,  human security guard subordinate Yuli?  I'm just popping out for a smoke break. No biggie.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. I talked to the office.  There's no robot security guard supervisor.  You're a lying piece of sheet metal.  - (gasps) - Uh-oh.  Okay, I lied.  I'm not a robot security guard.  Aha!  Because I got laid off.  They canceled the program.  - Did you see WALL-E? - No.  Excellent. What I'm telling you isn't that story at all.  I'm a lonely robot that's outlived its job.  Oh, no.  The company wants to recycle me,  turn me into a bunch of smaller, hotter robots.  Maybe I should make a run for it,  just get on the road  and ride as far as my charge will take me.  Whoa. That's life stuff. That's huge.  But how will I get out the front door?  I will need someone to open the front door.  Hey, I could open the front door.  - Yeah, right. - No, really.  I've got the key, I know the alarm code.  Let me do this one thing for you.  I'm totally lost here.  What was that?  (robotic voice): Nothing. Tina, shush!  Safe travels, robot. Avoid Philly.  Got it.  I feel like I want to go with you.  No.  You need me.  The school needs you. Stay here,  guard this place against prankster children.  I have to do this on my own.  Hey.  Oh, my God, what?!  Stay in touch.  Do you have e-mail?  I am e-mail.  Tina-Bot, you made it.  Sorry I'm late. A lot of sand.  Also, I had a little trouble with the volleyball net,  but I won that battle.  Great. Tina two-point-uch is here.  So much for a night of kids bonding.  Now it's just screen time.  Hey, Tina-Bot, uh  the sign says, ""No motorized vehicles on beach.""  (laughs)  Oh, my God, you are a motorized vehicle.  It also says no trash on the beach, Tammy.  So what are we gonna do here?  (laughs) Oh, my God, it does say that.  Shut it, Jocelyn.  Whoa, what the hell is the robot doing here?  Did anyone approve this?  I was told to do everything a normal student would do.  Well, stay out of the water.  And stay away from the fire.  And watch out for the sand.  And try to have fun.  What'd I miss?  There's some dancing. I guess I'm dancing.  Is this dancing?  Wow, look at Mr. Frond over there. He can really shake it.  Yep, everyone's having a great time, including me.  How's the bonfire going?  Wow, Mr. Frond's a really good dancer.  Oh, here comes Jimmy Junior.  Okay, Tina. It's time.  I'm gonna do my ""musoems.""  I-I'm pretty nervous, but I-I'm glad you're here.  Oh, my God, he's coming in!  (moaning)  Oh.  Oh, this is weird.  But I can't not look.  So long, childhood.  This is the worst episode of The O.C. ever.  Tina, honey, you okay?  You know, the same thing  happened to me when I was your age.  Really?  No, sweetie, this is the first time  this has happened to anyone.  That's it!  Hey, everyone.  It's such a nice night and we're all together.  And, um  I've been writing some poems and putting them to music.  Oh, you mean like songs?  No, they're called ""musoems.""  I'm just gonna start.  This one is called, uh, ""Pants.""  Pants are pretty great.   So that one's about pants.  Oh, he's right. That's not a song.  No, it is not. (chuckles)  Okay, here's another one.  How am I supposed to learn about life   When you won't let me watch The Good Wife?   Um all right, let me just get to the next  Oh. Um, okay, not that one.  What time is your dad coming to pick us up?  Um  Why don't you eat the mushrooms   If they are so good, Mom?   Oh, boy. He's dying.  Tina-Bot? Where's, uh, Tina-Bot?  Tina?  Yes, Jimmy Junior, in person.  Maybe it's more awkward this way, but at least it's real.  And maybe I need a crutch, but you can lean on me.  A little bit.  Aw, Tina's his crutch.  Aw.  Okay.  Now, let's hear some ""musoems.""  Not too many. Leave 'em wanting more.  If you want me to catch   Then don't throw so hard.   I like it.  It's about parents' expectations being too much sometimes.  What if God's name was Todd?   Jimmy Junior's  our Cat Stevens.  And our cat, Steven. Remember him?  Oh, my God, Lin. This is it.  What is?  (whispers): A banjo moment.  (gasps) I think you're right!  My banjo's in the car. I was gonna return it.  - Get it, hurry! - I'm going now!  Animal Planet, what if it was real?   I mean an actual planet for animals.   (banjo playing along)  Keep going. Watch me for the changes.  My left shoe smells, but my right one's okay.   And, um, that's all I got. Thank you.  - Oh. Uh - (scattered applause)  Thank you. Thank you very much.  Wait, are you in our grade?  TINA: Way to go, Dad.  In person kiss?  (both moaning)  I'm gonna step over here.  Hey, Mr. Frond, check it out. Banjo solo.  Listen, I've been a little hard on you.  But you stepped back at the right moment.  I respect that.  But I still got to put you in the ocean!  I said get over here! Get in there!  Oh, no, no, no, no, Zeke!  Watching you from a distant place   I'm calling you from my home base   My satellite's spinning right out of control   Transmission to the moon, now my message is go   And the moon is so cold, it's so cold   I can see food on your face   Watching you from a distant place.   JOCELYN: Look at me, look at me, I'm a robot."
"1 Stupid Cupid, you're a real mean guy   I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly   Stupid Cupid   I'm in love and it's a crying shame   Stupid Cupid   Happy Valentine's Day,  my little chalky hearts.  - I made you all cards. - Ooh.  Mine says I get a thousand kisses.  Give me some sugar, Mama!  Mwah, Mwah, Mwah, Mwah 1,000!  Don't short me, woman!  Louise, read your card now.  I don't really celebrate Valentine's Day.  It's an invented holiday, you know?  - Read it! - Fine, fine.  - It's the same as Gene's card. - Here come your kisses.  - Eh, Gene can have 'em. - Hell yes!  And here's your card, my little Valen-Tina.  (stomach grumbling): Oh, no. Oh, wow.  Oh-oh  - Tina, was that your stomach? - Yes.  We may have had a little friendly leftover  chili-eating contest last night.  Which I won.  Tina dominated.  It was like watching someone barf in reverse.  Well, you look a little pale, Tina.  Are you sure you don't want to stay home?  No. Anything can happen today,  because today is a day all about love,  and nothing can stop love. (stomach grumbles)  Oh, my God. Oh, my God!  That's right, Tina.  Nothing stopped me from buying your father  a box of chocolates  from a kid in the parking lot.  Thanks, Lin. I-I got you something  really nice as well.  - Really? - Yeah.  Can I have it now?  Y-You have to wait until a little later.  - Is that okay? - Oh, my God! I can't freakin' wait!  Oops, oops, oops, this opened. Mmm  (gags) Dark chocolate!  So dry, so bitter. Why?!  Num num num (shouts)  Walnuts? Just be normal, damn it!  ZEKE: Step right up  and buy one of my Mini Flower Love Weeds  for your valentine.  What flower what weeds?  A weed is just the right plant growing in the wrong place.  I'm selling bouquets for a buck each who's in?  - Hey, Tina. - Hey, Jimmy Jr.  Do you have any Valentine's plans?  Are you free today at lunch?  (gasps) Valentine's Day plans?  Today? Lunch? Me? With you?  (awkward laughter)  Uh, yeah.  No, I don't.  Cool. So will you meet me  in the gymnasium at lunch?  - I love it already. - Great.  What you're wearing is fine.  Unless you brought something else.  - You probably didn't. - Wait, what?  Did you bring ? Forget it.  Just, yeah. Don't be late, and brush your teeth.  (hums fanfare)  (stomach grumbles): Oh, my stomach.  Ugh, chili poops! Got to get to the bathroom.  Zeke is literally selling weeds,  and people are buying them. Gah!  This is the dumbest holiday ever.  Yeah, love can really make people do  some wacky things, huh? (inhales)  Hey, are you gonna be at lunch today?  Well, I made a reservation why?  Oh, I don't know. Just checking.  Check. Just pretending to check a box.  Anyway, I should be going.  - Bye. - Bye.  Poor kid picked up the wrong inhaler.  So what'd you get Linda for Valentine's Day, Bob?  Well, she's always wanted me to learn how to ballroom dance,  I guess in case we ever go back in time,  so, I wanted to take some classes.  Wow. So how many classes have you had?  Not quite enough, because none.  I've had none. I didn't sign up for any.  It's Valentine's Day. What are you gonna do?  Teddy, take it easy. I was gonna try and learn how to dance  on the Internet really quick.  Bob, you've got time for a real class.  My Zumba is at a studio, and they teach ballroom there.  You take one lesson, and you'll be like Gene Kelly,  if Gene Kelly only had one dance lesson.  That's a good idea, Teddy.  - I-I should go. Where is it? - I'll go with you.  (singsongy): I'm back with the pickles.  I'm gonna stare cutting them into hearts.  Lin, do you think you can maybe  handle the lunch rush by yourself?  What? Why?  I've got to go on an errand,  and it may or not have to do with your gift.  (gasps) So romantic.  Bob, tell me what it is.  - Linda, I'm not - No, I don't want to know.  I don't want to know. Forget it, forget it.  Get out before I guess it.  May I please have a hall pass, Ms. Twitchell?  I'm having boy troubles.  I'm sure you understand,  but it's also not what you think.  Hildy? It's Gene. Are you in there?  It's Wednesday. I'm here for my  day-old Taco Tuesday tacos.  Hello? What do we have here?  - Hey! - Aah!  You're not Hildy.    (voice fades, exotic music rises)  Whoa  Oh.  Hello.  (continues shouting)  Oh, you're yelling at me.  Uh, I'll leave. Bye.  I like you!  Sorry, ballroom's been canceled.  The teacher just waltzed right out of here.  Get it? I'm kidding, she died.  - Crap. Okay, Teddy, let's go, we tried. - No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.  They offer other classes here, you know.  Check a look. Women love any kind of dancing, Bob.  It demonstrates your virility  and your sexual style.  - My sexual style? - Yeah. Tell him.  - Yeah, it's true. - Uh, okay, fine.  I-I-I'll just take whatever class starts next.  We'll take whatever class starts next.  - Really? - You think I'm not gonna  take this class with you?  I did think that. I guess that was crazy.  (rock music playing)  (music becomes dreamlike)  Oh, shell yes!  How does a mermaid even ride one of those ?  Can I get one bouquet of Mini Flower Love Weeds, please?  ZEKE: That'll be one dollar, Romeo.  What are you doing, Rudy?  Why are you buying Love Weeds?  Who's the lucky ducky?  Let's just say we've been friends for a while,  but it's time to take it to the next level.  - You mean level two? - Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God, Rudy's gonna give me Love Weeds  for Valentine's Day.  Rudy like-likes me. Sick!  Oh, why would Rudy do something like this?  What kind of idiot like-likes someone?  - TINA: Louise? - Aah! Tina?  Yeah, I-I've been in here all morning.  - Oh, hi. Chili, huh? - Yeah.  Of all the days to get diarrhea of the butt.  Jimmy Jr. planned something special for me.  Wait, Rudy likes you?  Yeah, unfortunately.  - Which sized Rudy? - Regular.  Oh. Don't you like Rudy?  No, not like that.  We have a good thing going the way it is.  We're buddies. (sighs)  There's gotta be a way I can stop this.  Sorry, sister, I hate to tell you this,  but nothing, and I mean nothing,  can stop love. Except diarrhea.  No! I'm gonna beat this thing.  I mean, I get why he's on the Louise train.  I just have to find a way to get him  to jump off at the next stop. I gotta go.  Holler if you need TP or newspaper or anything.  Okay, Actually, I need another roll of TP.  Louise? I'll make it work.    Welcome to hip-hop dance class with Shelly.  See the way I'm walking,  with one of my arms lower than the other,  and my foot dragging?  Well, that's hip-hop.  Oh, my God. Oh, that's hip-hop.  The other day, I was in the grocery store  buying some light-bulbs and ice cream,  and I could tell the cashier didn't like my baggy pants.  But I didn't care, because that's hip-hop.  - Teddy, we need to get out of here. - Are you kidding me?  This is the coolest thing I've ever been a part of.  Oh, I see we have some new students in class.  'Sup?  'Sup, ma'am?  I bet you normally  sit on a chair the front way,  like everyone else.  But not in this class.  In this class you turn that chair around  and sit on it backwards.  You know why?  - Because that's hip - Because that's hip-hop.  Right, right. I-I got it.  Nice, Bob.  - Okay, everybody, - (hip-hop music playing)  There's gonna be some profanity coming at you,  so cover your ears if you can't handle the ""B"" word.  Oh, hey, Ms. Selbo.  What are you doing here on a school day?  I took a personal day.  My boyfriend Martin broke up with me.  (gasps): No!  Yeah. I was totally blindsided.  That jerk.  He's across the street at Jimmy Pesto's.  There's nothing good about that place.  (crying): I like the jalapeÃ±o poppers.  Okay, that's one good thing about that place.  And their Pesto Coladas. Two things.  Hey    Oh, uh, hi. I only have five minutes  before recess is over, but, uh, I was wondering  if you could maybe slap my wrist again.  I think I licked all the chocolate off  the last slap mark.    I don't know what you're saying,  but it makes me feel like I felt  the time I sat on the dryer.  You want me to stir, or is this a gift?  Si, stir.  - I'm Gene, by the way. - Isabella.  So I guess Hildy's out sick today?  Sick. Si, Si.  So if that's our lunch,  is this our dessert?  No, no, no, mi gattino.  This is for mi Amor, Francesco.  Oh, boyfriend.  Si, boyfriend.  Hmm. What grade is he in?  He sounds ugly.  Time to Un-attract.  - Oh, hey, buddy. - Hey, Louise.  Quick question. Do you like boogers?  Um, what?  I've been eating my boogs all morning,  and I love 'em.  I was wondering if anyone else was into boogers.  Oh, okay, no.  Want to try one of mine?  Maybe mine are extra good.  - I don't know, huh. - That's pretty gross.  So what can I get you? You want a wet one, a dry one?  - Uh, I'm feeling sick. - Great!  But you know what, I gotta say,  the whites of your eyes are bright,  your fingernails are strong and healthy.  Maybe there's something to this eating boogers thing.  I mean, hey, whatever you're doing,  keep it up, sister.  Bye. See you at lunch.  You've gotta be kidding me.  Okay, doing good. (sighs)  Feeling confident, feeling cool.  Starting to strut.  Oh, God! The strut was too much.  No strutting. No strutting.  (breathing rapidly)  - (grunts) - There she is.  J-Jimmy Jr. What's going on?  Remember that anti-drug group that came last week  to do a presentation?  You mean Thrills, Not Pills?  Yeah. They did a number on me.  I couldn't believe the national statistics.  Well, they left behind all their props,  including this trampoline.  So everyone is here to watch us do a sky kiss!  Yeah!  - A what? - A sky kiss, Tina.  We bounce up and down like this  until we get high enough, and then we kiss.  You want me to bounce on that trampoline?  Uh-huh.  It's romantic and dangerous,  like a candle.  I (stomach grumbles)  Uh, I'll be right back.  Feelings are scary, girl!  Nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Uh, why are why are you saying that?  - Nah, nah, nah. - Is there a problem?  I'm-I'm just trying to tie my shoe.  That's not hip-hop. Peep my feets.  - Your shoes are untied. - That's hip-hop.  Okay, good to know.  - People call me Flips Whitefudge. - They do?  You think you can just come up in my mom's class  and learn how to dance?  Wait, Shelly is your mom?  She's your mom! No, she's my mom.  Look, I-I'm just trying to learn how to dance  as a gift for my wife for Valentine's Day.  Well, that's actually incredibly sweet!  Um, thank you.  You're welcome, but if you want to hip-hop,  you gotta prove yourself.  We're gonna hip-hop dance battle.  Is everything all right here?  Uh, sort of. Your son,  Flips Whitefudge, is trying to battle us.  Uh, Flips? We've talked about this.  No, Ma. This is what you taught me.  If it's not hip-hop, then it's not hip-hop.  If they want to learn from you, they got to battle me.  Well, he really won't give this up unless you battle him.  So, I guess you guys are battlin'.  We can do this. We can beat this guy.  Teddy, we don't know any hip-hop.  Yes, we do. It's inside us.  - Now untie your shoes, ""B"" word. - Let's do this.  Right after we stretch out.  (moans)  Why did I come here?  Oh, God. Oh, God.  It's happening. It's going down.  - I'm gonna hide behind this napkin. - Hey, Louise.  I have something very important to ask you  - Rudy, let me stop you right there. - I was just gonna  Look. No, I get it.  We live in a commercial culture.  Love is in the movies. It's in all the songs.  But we don't have to be pawns in the game.  - Yeah. I - We're just friends.  Louise, I wanted to ask you  to give this Love Weed and this card  to Chloe Barbash for me, in Science.  What?  You have science with Chloe Barbash  - after lunch, right? - I  Y-Yeah. I think so.  Okay, good, 'cause she's  the most beautiful girl in the world.  She smells like someone's baking a cake in her hair.  It's her shampoo.  I heard she uses the whole bottle every time.  She takes my breath away.  I mean, everything does, but still.  Thanks, Louise. You're the coolest.  Great. So Rudy likes Chloe Barbash.  And not me.  What a relief.  RUDY: Oh, hey, Louise!  Try not to get any boogers on the card.  LOUISE: Chloe freakin' Barbash?  Rudy might as well like a box of packing peanuts.  She's all fluff. There's nothing in there.  TINA: Wow, Louise, you seem a little worked up about this.  - Do I? - (toilet flushes)  I agree with Louise. By the way,  this is from my house and I brought it here,  not the other way around. Got it?  Mm. The chocolate needs more,  how you say, bitter?  I think the word you're looking for is butter.  I have some in my locker if we can't find any here.  Oh, no, no, no. Not butter.  Bitter. We make dark chocolate.  (gasps) Dark chocolate?  No! Don't do it!  It is like love.  Sweet, bitter.  Happy, sad.  Don't use your sensual Italian wisdom on me!  It's not fair, but keep talking!    Yo, yo. It's battle time.  Drop that beat, Ma.  (beat begins playing)  You scared, mustache?  Uh, yes. (grunting)  Is this it? I can't tell if he's started yet.  I'm gonna Janet Jackson this.  - Ow! - Ooh. Ah!  Oh, Flips. Sweetie, are you okay?  I got my lips stuck in my braces.  Well, I'm injured now, so I guess you guys won the battle.  Um, okay.  Ma, it's time to teach these LL Fool Js  how to dance.  Hey, Chloe. These are from Regular Sized Rudy.  He wanted me to give them to you.  - And the card. - Great. Thanks.  That's it?  Don't you want to read the card?  Mm. Maybe later.  Oh That is a lot of shampoo.  Thanks. I use it when I take a shower.  Okay, class. Today we'll be dissecting a banana.  We only have two, so get into groups of 13.  MS. SELBO: That was a delicious burger, Linda.  I have to admit, it really lifted my spirits.  Great. I'm sure you'll start feeling better in a couple days.  After all, you just broke up.  Oh, no. We broke up a year ago.  Wait, I thought you broke up today.  I thought you came here from Jimmy Pesto's.  No, no, no. He's at Jimmy Pesto's.  I just followed him, and I've been watching him  from your restaurant.  That's not alarming.  I just haven't been myself since the breakup.  I mean, it's not like me to sleep outside someone's house  or steal someone's dog or pee on someone's mail  and then watch them open it and laugh  when they eat a breakfast sandwich with that same hand.  No! You wouldn't do those things.  But I did. I did those things.  Look, it sounds  like you just need some closure.  And, uh, maybe some professional help.  But I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go over there  and bring Martin in here.  You're never gonna get over this  unless you deal with it face-to-face.  - You can't stab him, though, okay? - You're so sweet to me.  Wait, I can or I can't? You probably said ""can't.""  Ugh, what's taking so long?  What's Tina even doing? Combing her boobs?  (both laugh)  (sighs)  TINA: Hello.  Tina! You're here!  Let's do this!  Jimmy Jr., I walked slowly and carefully back  to tell you that I can't do the sky kiss with you.  My heart says yes, but my butt says no.  Wait, what are you saying, Tina?  Can I tell you down here? It'd be a little bit  - better for me. - No, just shout it out.  I'm on a trampoline. I'm not coming down.  I have diarrhea, okay? I have horrible diarrhea!  If I jump up and down, I could explode!  - Gross. - Oh.  - Girls get diarrhea? - Big time.  No. They don't, actually. They don't.  I used to think nothing can stop love.  But it looks like I was wrong. I'm sorry, Jimmy Jr.  (stuttered groaning)  (bell ringing)  Do So you gave it to her, right?  Yeah, I gave it to her.  - But listen - Now we begin  Operation: Kiss Chloe Barbash.  Wait, what?  The card on the bouquet said  to meet me on the playground at the end of the day  so I can give Chloe a Valentine's kiss.  My first kiss.  My first non-parents- and-grandmother kiss.  Oh, boy. Rudy,  do you really think she likes you?  Like, like-likes you?  Um, yeah, she made it pretty clear, Louise.  She passes me notes in class all the time.  Check it out. ""Dear Cutie-Bear.    -  - Oh.  Yeah. Pretty hot stuff, huh?  Well, I'm gonna go look in the mirror so I can remember  what I looked like before everything changed.  Oh, no. If I don't do something about this,  Regular Sized Rudy is gettin' big time screwdy.  Don't say screwdy.  Sorry. I brought these coffee filters from home, by the way.  Not the other way around.  The jig is up. I know what you're doing, Chloe.  What are you talking about, Louise?  I know that you've been acting flirty with Regular Sized Rudy  just to get his quiz answers.  Rudy's a big boy. If he feels like giving me the answers,  that's up to him.  Okay, listen, he's not a ""big boy.""  He's regular-sized.  And that kid has more heart in his regular-sized body  than anyone else in this school. And you're you  Oh, my God. You're freaking out.  Yes! Because Rudy wants to meet you after school  to give you his first kiss. And you know what?  You're gonna give him his first kiss.  Why would I do that? Because he gave me some weeds?  Yes!  Louise, he isn't the only boy  that gave me weeds today. This is from Kevin.  Kevin Ishihara. He juggled three Beanie Babies  at the last talent show. Three.  Rudy is like the slowest runner in our grade.  He's the slowest runner in the world!  Everybody knows that! He shouldn't be running at all!  That's what I'm saying!  He starts running, and after two paces,  he has to stop to breathe.  I know. It's so embarrassing.  Yeah. And you're gonna suck it up!  You're gonna kiss that slow man!  You're gonna kiss slow, Regular Sized Rudy,  or you're gonna be eating that Love Weed through a straw.  Get off of me!  - No! Oh, you - Stop it!  (struggling)  Stop! I am not kissing him, Louise.  Bye!  Damn it. She smells so good.  Perfetto.  Mangia. Mangia.  I never thought I'd go over to the dark-chocolate-side.  (chomping)  Oh!    (horn honks)  He is here. I must leave.  Who's here? Oh, right.  Francesco.  (horn honks)  Oh  Ciao, Gene Belcher.  (sighs) Ciao, Isabella Kitchen Substitute.  I'm taking this home to fix it.  Um, sure.  Huh. Love, it looks like you can't be stopped.  Yeah. She's just right this way.  (gasps)  (moaning)  Ms. Selbo! What are you doing?  Living my damn life, Linda!  Oh, hello, Martin. I have a serious boyfriend now.  His name is Him.  J-Jim Him Jim.  Jim Himjim.  Well, I I-I'm gonna go.  Quick question. Do you think I could have my dog back?  (groans) You're so desperate.  Fine.  - Thank you. - Aw.  Uh Hi, everyone.  - CLASS: Wow! Whoa! - TAMMY: What?  Jimmy Jr., I can't jump up and down.  But I can walk on these stilts.  Uh, wait, no, I can't Okay, got it.  Where'd you get those, Tina?  A trampoline and thrills aren't the only thing  Thrills Not Pills left behind.  They also left these.  Now, come on, Jimmy Jr.  We're going to the gymnasium.  - Yeah! - Wait, what?  We'll be back in five minutes, Ms. Jacobson.  Excuse me while I sky kiss this guy.  (phone ringing)  Bob's Burgers.  BOB: Hi, Linda. It's your valentine.  Can you come outside? Your gift is here.  (gasps) Oh, my God!  Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!  W-Wait, what's going on?  Why do you look like that?  - (beat playing) - Bob. Linda.  Hey there, Teddy. Nice boom box.  Thanks, Bob. Dope pants.  Why are you two acting weird? What's going on?    (both grunting)  Bobby, did you take a dance class? I love it.  - Mind if we hop in that hip? - What Uh  (imitates air horn)  (grunting)  Hey, Louise. Where's Chloe?  Rudy, I have to tell you something. She's not coming.  Um Did Did she not get my card?  She did. Um, but she's still not coming.  Um, do Do you get what I'm saying?  Not really.  Oh, God! Rudy!  Chloe doesn't want to be your valentine.  But what what about all those notes?  Oh, my God. Get it through your thick, round skull, Rudy!  Chloe doesn't like you.  But who cares, right?  I guess I care.  Well, then stop it! Stop caring.  Yeah, okay. Well, thanks for letting me know, Louise.  I guess I was silly to think I could get a kiss on Valen  Mmm!  Sky kiss!  - Yeah! - (cheering)  Mwah.  Yeah.  Mmm.  Mwah.  - Mwah! - Whoa.  (grunts) Ow.  - If you tell anyone about this - Uh-huh.  - I will end you. - (whispers): I think I'm sweating.  Excuse me. Coming through.  E-Emergency.  (Tina sighs)  Made it.  Ooh, sky kiss   Ooh, sky kiss   Ooh, sky kiss."
"1    Linda, Linda, the proofs are in!  Ooh, ooh, let me see, let me see!  What proofs? What's going on?  Gayle got some professional pictures taken of Mr. Business.  Um, okay. Great. Why?  Ian said we'd need them if we wanted Mr. Business  to be taken seriously for the Chef Cat cat food auditions.  The what? Who-who's Ian?  The cat agent, Bob. (scoffs)  Oh. I-I didn't know you had a cat agent, Gayle.  Yeah, Gayle and I met a cat agent last week  when we were leaving the grooming place  on our way to the Soup Buffet.  And he thinks Mr. Business has what it takes  to be the next spokes-cat for Chef Cat cat food.  You know, Chef Cat.  No, I-I don't know that.  If cats could cook, they'd cook Chef Cat.   Yeah, that's it, that's it.  - Such a great song. - Not really.  When the original Chef Cat died,  they found another cat that looked just like him.  And then after that and then after that.  They just kept replacing him.  Just like they do with the president.  The current Chef Cat is on his last legs,  so they need a new one.  They have a big competition.  Oh, by the way, Lin, I need to borrow  just a little more money from you  to cover the shipping cost for the portraits.  They have to go in something called ""overnight mail.""  Overnight mail, ooh.  Just when you thought the mail couldn't get any sexier.  Dad's an overweight male.  Is that kind of the same thing?  Wait, Gayle needs to borrow more money?  Yeah, Linda covered the cost of the headshots for me.  - She did? - Oh, it was nothing.  - It was barely nothing, it was - It was $222.  - It was? - Well, that no.  No, it wasn't that much.  Here's the receipt, right here.  Linda, can I talk to you in the kitchen?  No  Lin, I thought we decided to pull back  on lending Gayle money.  - Oh, did we? - Yes!  - But she hardly ever asks for money. - What?!  I need to borrow  sixteen   forty-one  a hundred and five   $22 for   rug shampoo.  control-top panty hose.   my Magic Bullet Blender payments.  I'm three months behind.   Christmas gifts for you guys!  lube.  Fine. I'll tell her she's got to pay for the shipping herself.  (dishes crash)  Sorry, I broke a big stack of plates!  But don't worry, I'll pay you back for them.  (whispering): Hey, do you kids have any money? It's for plates.  Oh, my God.  Tina, hon, can you grab me a trash bag?  Sure.  Whoa, look at this.  A box. Hey, wow.  I want a box. Why does Tina get to have a box?  - Yeah! - Huh, Gayle must have left that here  the last time she brought her cats over.  This cat really does look like Mr. Business.  - Yeah, he kind of does. - See, Bob?  I told you that cat agent wasn't lying.  Yeah, they look alike, but that still doesn't mean  Gayle should we should give a bunch of money to this guy.  We don't even know if he's a real agent.  He seems pretty legit to me.  He had a business card and everything.  Anyone can have a card, Lin. Teddy has a card.  - So does Ken. - Gene.  It's true. It has his pager number on it.  - Want one? - No.  - You do. - This guy is definitely scamming Gayle.  You know what? I'm gonna go talk to him tomorrow  and see if I can get our money back.  Aw, you're gonna break Gayle's heart.  She was really excited.  Oops. I got it.  Hmm. (sniffs) This stuff smells kind of good.  (sniffs)  Whoa. Mmm.  What am I doing? (music stops)  Definitely not eating cat food. (chuckles)  - What'd you say, hon? - Uh, n-nothing.  Um (mouth full): oh, my God, that's delicious.  (grunts)  - (door opens)  - Hello there.  Uh, Snoodle, greet.  Oh, um, h-hello.  - Snoodle, hug. - Oh okay.  (chuckles): I, um  Snoodle, rest. How can I be of help to you?  Uh, are you Ian Amberson?  Guilty as charged, I'm afraid.  Well, my name is Bob Belcher, and I think you may be  taking advantage of my sister-in-law.  She's a grown woman and it's her body!  Wait, y-you did stuff to her body?  Oh, I don't know. Is your sister-in-law named Karen?  - No, Gayle. - Oh, Gayle! (laughs)  Whew!  Oh good, good, that is good.  Uh, Karen, by the way, for the record, made the first move.  If anything, she's taking advantage of me.  Anyway, uh, my wife lent Gayle some money for cat headshots.  Ooh. Well, yes, very smart investment, of course.  Her cat is a dead pip for Chef Cat.  Well, it turns out she isn't going to use those pictures,  so I'd like to collect a refund from you.  Wait, she's not going to use them?  Well, she'd be a fool not to mail in those headshots.  - Oh, really? - Uh, yeah, really.  I should know. I managed a Chef Cat from 1993 to 1998.  His real name was Bootsy, of course.  Best years of my life.  So far, let's say.  There's always tomorrow. Fingers crossed.  Look, I see what you're doing.  You're taking advantage of vulnerable cat ladies  and overcharging them for photos  Ah, bup, bup, bup, bup. Bootsy made $40,000 a year in residuals  - alone when he was Chef Cat. - Oh.  And one time, we got to meet Dean Cain.  - Oh. - He's super-nice, Bob.  So maybe check that tone.  So, you're trying to tell me that you really truly think  that Mr. Business could be one of these Chef Cats?  Oh, yes, absolutely, I believe he could.  - With my help. - Uh-huh.  Look, you can ask anyone in the pet agent game about me.  I'm the real deal.  This competition will be the big-time, Bob.  People are coming in from all over the world  with gray and white Persian Longhair mixes.  But Gayle and Mr. Business,  well, they'll be walking in with Ian Amberson.  And that still means something in this crazy world.  - I don't know. - You know what? Fine.  Bob, if-if you just want to keep living a life in the shadows,  afraid to seize the furry tail of a star  and just ride that rocket into space,  by all means, be my guest.  I will refund the cost of the headshots. I'll do it.  Now, if you'll excuse me, uh, I have to find a hamster  who can look surprised about a pizza delivery.  Not easy, by the way.  (grunts) Damn it.  Gayle said you need more money to mail the photos?  - $35 we have to overnight it. - You take a check?  Give it to Snoodle; he's trained to endorse checks.  - Snoodle? - Uh, 'Kay.  Okay, gonna go to the cat agent with Gayle  for Mr. Business's first training.  And we just heard he has an official audition time.  Next Saturday at 4:25 p.m Can you stand it?  Great. If this works,  Gayle will have a way to earn her own money,  and she won't need as much of ours.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. How much money are we talking about?  Ian said Chef Cat made $40,000 a year in 1998.  That's like Chumbawumba money!  I am very excited to announce my new role  - as Mr. Business's business manager. - Congratulations.  Yeah, my fee is 30%.  - No, Louise. - I insist.  Pretty soon, we'll all be living  in Mr. Business's guest house,  running his lifestyle brand and helping him stay clean.  WOMAN (over TV):  If cats could cook   They'd cook Chef Cat.   Snoodle, TV.  Snoodle, lights.  And that, my friends,  is exactly what Mr. Business has to do.  He has to turn off the TV with his face  and turn the lights on with his paw?  - No, Gayle. - (sighs)  The stuff from the commercial, Gayle.  - My God. - Oh.  (squawks) Polly wants a great deal on a quality mattress.  Good, Petey.  Ooh, does Petey have an audition coming up?  Actually, Petey did the commercial in 2002.  Once an animal is trained to do something,  they tend to never give up the behavior.  They just do it over and over and over again  until their owner abandons them on your doorstep, right, Petey?  (squawks) Polly wants a great deal on a quality mattress.  All right, so I've placed some treats here, here and here.  Uh, that will lure him to hit the marks.  So go ahead and let Mr. Business out of his carrier,  and let's see how we do.  Uh, on three.  Un, deux  - Oh, my God! Ow! - (Mr. Business snarling)  Oh, God! Get it off me! Shoot it!  - Somebody shoot this cat! - (clattering)  Shoot it!  You have the shot! Take the shot!  Tina, Dad needs you back on the grill.  - (mouth full): Nothing! - Oh, my God!  Are you eating cat food?  - No. - It's-it's all over your face.  Let me try.  Oh, my.  It is good!  This has to be our shameful secret, Gene.  One of many.  How'd it go?  - Uh, not so good. - Yeah.  What? What happened?  Mr. Business assaulted Ian.  (Mr. Business meows)  Ian said unless we could get Mr. Business  to knock the spice jar into the pot ourselves,  we should probably forget the whole thing.  - What?! - Son of a bitch!  Oh, well. We tried.  - You're still the puss in my boots. - (Mr. Business meows)  W-Wait, wait, you're just gonna give up?  - Yeah. - That's the spirit!  You have a chance to start making $40,000 a year  for doing literally almost nothing,  and you're gonna give up after one try?  - Seems like. - No, no, Gayle,  let my client out, I want to talk to him.  Gayle, no, we can't have cats on the counter.  Gayle, let him out.  Mr. Business, get back in the crate.  - (purrs) - Whoa, Dad.  - What? - He did exactly what you said.  You are a cat whisperer.  Yeah, Dad, you're really good at that.  I almost got in the crate.  (gasps) That's it!  Dad, you could teach Mr. Business  to knock over the thing.  You could be his trainer!  Huh, yeah, maybe.  And I bet if you could train him to knock over the jar,  Ian would still represent us.  I mean, I-I'd need to take my allergy pills.  Which makes me nervous  because they say don't mix them with alcohol,  and I always mix them with alcohol.  Eh, I don't know.  Maybe Mr. Business just wasn't meant to hit the big-time.  What?! With those looks and that ass?  Oh, come on, Gayle.  - Couldn't you use the money? - Sure, I guess.  I could buy some more cats finally.  (sighs) All right.  Looks like I'm the new cat trainer.  What do you say, Mr. Business? You want to be  the next Chef Cat cat food cat?  No one is eating cat food!  God, why would you even say that?  - N-No one said that, Tina. - I know.  (both laughing awkwardly)  Cat training, training a cat   Cat training, training a cat   Cat training, training a cat   Put a lot of work in, get a little bit fat   Chomp, chomp, chow, chow   Knock that jar down.   Oh, hey. Uh  That's weird, that thing you're doing.  P-Pushing your paw.  I-It kind of hurts, 'cause you're really pressing.  It's also kind of nice, though.  Look, Mr. Business, (groans)  I know you're probably tired of me  trying to get you to knock over that stupid jar. I get it.  I-I don't like doing what people tell me to do either.  That's why I have my own restaurant.  So, don't do it because I want you to.  Do it for you.  I mean, this could be good for you.  You make your own money.  See the world. You can move away from Gayle.  Just kidding.  I-I know you like her. She's nice.  So, what do you say, huh? You-you want to go  knock over a jar?  Hmm? Who wants to knock the jar over?  You do!  Yes! Yes! You did it!  Mr. Business! (yowling)  Ow, ow! Oh, God, ow!  (sneezes): Oh oh, God!  Oh, Bob, Linda, Gayle.  Um, what are you doing here?  Hey, Ian, Snoodle.  Look, I know there was an incident  the other day with Mr. Business, but we've been working together,  and you won't believe this, but he's actually able  to knock over the spices.  Right. Um  - Uh, who's that? - Yeah, who's that?  Ah, this is Fluffy, and this is her cat Jessica.  Uh, Jessica looks a lot like Mr. Business.  She doesn't, Bob. She looks like Chef Cat.  So you'll be representing both of us at the auditions?  I'm afraid not, Bob.  What? But-but he can do the thing now!  He can do it. Show him, Bob.  That cat is a loose cannon. You saw what he did.  Not anymore, Ian. I trained him.  Uh, please, Bob. You're not a professional.  Oh, so you're just gonna help any cat  who looks like Chef Cat Is that it?  Uh, no, Bob. I'm going to help Jessica.  And I'm, by the way, in a serious  committed relationship with Fluffy now.  So you get people's hopes up,  make them believe in something,  and then toss them aside when you find a younger hotter cat?  Bob, you calm down now.  You know what? We're going to that audition without you, Ian.  - We are? - Yes, we are, Gayle.  I am going to get Mr. Business  to knock over that spice jar in front of the judges.  - Producers! - Whatever!  But he's not very good at it.  He's great at it! Occasionally. Once.  You won't stand a chance, Bob.  Please, do not embarrass the cat like that.  - We don't have to take this. - No, we don't.  - Come on, Lin. - Yeah.  Bob, can I come, too?  Yes, Gayle, you come with us.  Yay. And I should bring the cat?  - Yes, Gayle, it's your cat! - LINDA: Yeah, come on.  Okay. Bye, Ian. Bye, Fluffy.  Can we just leave?!  Get the cat. Get the cat.  Oh, my God, get out!  We're trying!  (quietly): I can't even look at this food.  (quietly): I know. No crunch, no tuna flavor. This is garbage.  - I can't believe we're out of Chef Cat. - So what do we do?  Maybe this is our wake-up call.  Maybe we should, you know, try to stop eating cat food?  (whispers): I have been throwing up on the rug.  So let's do it. We'll just have a normal day  where we don't think about cat food at all.  Everybody ready to go to the cat food audition today?  - Oh, damn it! - Attagirl!  - (doorbell rings) - Uh, uh, there's Gayle.  Time to go. Come on, kids. Time to go.  I'm about to go from ""meow"" to me rich.  Let's go, Team Business!  Wow, a lot of people here. A lot of cats.  And they all look like Mr. Business.  Except for that one.  - Get out of here, Garfield! - Yeah!  Dad, which cats look like the biggest competition?  You point them out, I'll get in their heads.  We don't have any competition, Louise.  Mr. Business is gonna win this, no problem.  Hey, Mr. Biz, how you holding up?  Gayle, please don't rile him up right now. We need him focused.  I'm just checking on him, Bob.  Okay, you're opening up the carrier.  Oh, no, he's licking his tummy!  He does that when he's unhappy.  Look. Oh, my gosh, a patch of fur is missing.  I guess. It's a little thin there, but  Has he been doing this all week, Bob?  Uh, I don't know.  I thought when he licked his tummy,  that's just him getting psyched up.  Uh, yeah, that's right.  No, this is bad, Bob.  Please, Gayle, you're making him nervous.  I am not. I make him angry, not nervous.  (mewling)  Oh, I'm worried about this, Bob.  Something's wrong.  Uh, Louise, uh, didn't you want to go get  a soda at the soda machine?  And also you wanted someone to go with you?  Oh, right, right. Right, yes.  Aunt Gayle, will you please go to the soda machine with me?  You push the buttons so well.  - I do? - You do.  I use my elbow because of the germs.  - Okay, go. Go, go, go. - Okay.  Go have fun at the soda machine.  I'm excited. I didn't know I was so good at it.  (sighs) Okay, Mr. Business, pep talk.  Listen, first of all, haters gonna hate.  And there's nothing you can do about that.  (chuckles) Good thing we're totally over cat food,  because otherwise this would be a nightmare.  Yep. Oh, God, there's a lot of cat food.  - Free samples of cat food.  Look, there's Mom! Let's ask her  to chain us up like werewolves  to protect us from ourselves.  Mother!  - (gasps) - Are you  You're eating Chef Cat!  Uh, what the uh, oh.  I-I am.  (laughs) What a crazy  I mean, who would eat cat food? Who does that?  - What flavor is it? - Cheese 'n' Chicken.  - Hand it over. - No.  - Yes. - Fine.  - (sighs) - Gimme.  Wait a second.  Mom, was that your box of Chef Cat under the sink?  Yeah. So what?  I like to have a little cat food to relax every once in a while.  Is that a crime? Give it back.  (gasps) Our addiction is genetic!  I'm not to blame! I'm a cat food baby.  I never had a chance.  And that little boy who didn't make the basketball team was me.  So don't be me, be you, because you've got that edge,  you've got that attitude and spark,  and, I've learned a lot from you.  Sometimes I feel like you're the teacher and I'm the cat.  Um the end.  I have to go (coughs) get some water  'cause I'm allergic to you, and I've been talking a long time.  - Ian. - Hello, Bob.  I saw you over there.  Giving the cat a pep talk?  That's good, good for, good for both of you.  That'll really make a difference.  Oh, really?  No, of course not, Bob. It's a cat.  Don't try and get in my head, Ian.  I don't need to, Bob. You're not going to win.  Yes, we are. You aren't going to beat us.  Oh, okay. Good comeback, Bob.  Bye-bye, Bob.  No, bye-bye to you, Ian.  Bye-bye to you, Bob.  Oh, no! Bye-bye to you, Ian!  Oh, oh, bye-bye! Bye-bye!  Bye-bye with my hand in your face!  All right, big guy, we're  Wait, wait, wait. Where  Oh, my God, Ian took Mr. Business!  My baby! My baby!  Mr. Business?! Mr. Business?!  - Oh, my God, all you cats look the same - (meows)  - Sorry. - Dad!  Louise, someone took Mr. Business.  - What? - Wait, wh-where's Gayle?  Well, she ran away!  She said she needed to go into the bathroom and cry,  and I gave her the usual five minutes,  and then I went in there and she was gone.  Oh, my God.  Ian didn't take the cat, Gayle did.  How we gonna find her?  (woman sobbing loudly in distance)  That could be her.  (woman continues sobbing)  (panting): Oh oh, geez.  - How many flights was that? - One.  - Really? - Yeah.  (groans): Oh  - Are you gonna die right now? - Maybe.  GAYLE: No one's hiding up here!  It's just me, the sad janitor  and my janitor cat, Mr. Brooms.  (chuckles): Oh, okay. Sorry to bother you.  (panting): Okay one second.  - Hi, Gayle. - Hi.  Gayle, what are you, what are you doing?  (sniffs) Sitting.  Uh, yes. So, we're gonna miss our audition time. Did you know that?  Yeah. Yeah, I know.  Okay, all right, this has been fun, but listen.  I need to get my client down to the audition, stat.  Do you want to talk about why you're crying?  I just get sad when Mr. Business gets sad.  Oh, he's sad?  Yes, Bob.  He licked the fur off his belly.  Look at it. You can see his nipples.  Gayle, I know Mr. Business may be a little stressed out.  ""A little stressed out,"" Bob?  I've never seen his nipples like this. Never!  The entertainment world is no place for him.  Oh, okay, so, like, cats don't want to be famous.  Gayle, this is a real opportunity  for you and Mr. Business.  - Mm-hmm. - You should take it,  because you borrow a lot of money from us.  - Like, a lot. - I do?  Yeah. And that's fine. It doesn't bother me at all,  but it bothers Linda a little bit.  - Oh. - But this could be a chance  for you to make a little money for yourself.  And you could get a better apartment or  What's wrong with my apartment?  - Nothing. - I love it.  Or you could go out to eat once in a while.  Where?  Point is, Gayle,  you could be a little more independent,  and we could not give you money so much.  So, so much money.  I I just want Mr. Business to be happy.  (sighs) I I guess I-I see your point.  You care more about your cat than you do about money,  and that's actually nice.  Even though it's really our money you don't care about.  Yeah.  Okay, let's go home.  Sure, sure. Just let me borrow the cat  for, like 15 minutes, and then I'll be right back.  Not for an audition, for something else.  - Okay. - No.  Fine.  I'll trade you ""Cat-ch of the Day""  for ""Filet Meow-gnon.""  Are you out of your damn mind, Mom?!  (sighs) Let's all just go take a nap in the sun.  - Yes. - Hi, guys.  So, uh, some news. Things didn't  Oh, my God, Lin, you're still doing this? You told me you quit.  Well, I lied.  Don't judge me. You watch sports sometimes.  - Yeah. - Oh, Tina, not you, too.  And me!  Why in the world would you all eat cat food?  Strong nails, a healthy shiny coat, confident stools.  You guys are crazy.  Yes, crazy.  You got to warm it up and put it on your oatmeal.  - Uh-huh. Go on. - Oh, my God.  Geez, I feel left out. Gimme some, Gene.  Oh, good Lord, you're eating  Oh, that is so disgusting.  Oh, is it, Ian? Is it so disgusting?  - Yes. - Oh, God, it is.  Ugh. What is wrong with all of you?  Keep eating, Dad, you'll get it.  No, I won't.  Oh, wait, there it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmm, that's good.  How'd your cat do in there, Ian?  - She choked. - Ha!  It's not funny.  She literally choked on the food. I had to Heimlich her!  Ha! What an idiot. Look at us. Look.  (chews noisily) Swallow.  We can all eat cat food without choking, so the joke's on you, Ian.  I guess so, Bob. I guess so.  Bye-bye, Bob.  Bye-bye, Ian.  Whoop. All right.  Okay, yep, got it.  Whoop! Caught that one.  Oh, Mr. Business, you are killing me.  Okay, there we go.  Whoa! Oh.  Just a few more years till you die.  Yeah, that's good.

"1 Gene, breakfast. Yum!  Sorry I took so long,  but I think you'll agree  it was worth the wait.  Ooh, yes.  Why are you wearing your fancy clothes?  Why aren't you wearing yours?  - These are my fancy clothes. - Mm.  Gene's all dressed up for the school-wide mock trial.  He's the big, tough prosecutor.  Oh, right. Right.  I'm a sharp-dressed, silver-tongued devil.  And he's going up against Louise,  the savvy defense lawyer.  It's Belcher against Belcher!  Whoop-Dee-Doo!  We win either way!  It is impressive that our kids  got chosen to be the lawyers.  It really is. Also, totally random.  Yep. Literally picked out of a hat.  And we can't forget the most important role of all  Tina the juror!  With great jury comes great responsibility.  You lucked out, T.  I wish I could sit on the jury and zone out  while we do a mock trial of Snow White.  Whoa, do you think the Evil Queen  gave Snow White a poison apple?  Yes!  That's for a jury of her peers to decide.  But probably.  It's just so babyish.  I mean, why can't we do a mock trial  of a double homicide or something?  Ooh, double homicide. Twice as nice!  WOMAN: Okay, everyone,  Judge Conklin is just outside, and he's ready to begin.  He's retired, but today he's going to hear our case  and guide us through the process.  - I want to be Snow White. -   - Uh, snow way. -   Bailiff Zeke,  why don't you get us started?  Hear ye, hear ye!  The court of the Honorable Judge Conklin  is now in session.  - All rise. - Honorable?  I haven't been called that since 1997.  Maybe you should call me  the ""somewhat respectable"" Judge Conklin.  (laughing) He's funny!  Ooh, the somewhat wet and messy Judge Conklin.  I had a little accident. Just water, not pee.  (laughs): God, this guy's got no filter.  Be seated!  (sighs) It's gonna be a long day.  - Okay, here we go. -   We will first hear from the prosecution.  Your Honor, ladies and gentleman of the jury,  here are the facts: the Evil Queen  was jealous of my client, the gorgeous,  but-a-little-sun-wouldn't- kill-her Snow White,  and gave her a poison apple, sending her  into a sleeping death.  To sum it up, not cool.  So do your thing and return a verdict of guilty.  Okay, counterpoint: she's not guilty.  Thank you.  - Louise? - Yes ma'am?  If you don't want to participate,  then you can just write a thousand-word essay  on the legal system, due tomorrow.  What am I supposed to do?  I mean, her first name is ""Evil.""  - Louise - Ugh! Fine.  You know any places that make  good food, Bob?  Uh, yeah, Mort, why?  I'm hosting my mom's birthday party, and I need a caterer.  Oh, okay. So us? Bob's Burgers?  Oh, God no!  Geez, Mort. Yeah, what the hell?  If I was having a funeral,  I'd get my dead bodies from your place.  No, no, no, no, don't get me wrong, it's not you.  It's just that my mom's picky.  If it doesn't have a shrimp on it, she won't eat it.  Uh, I love your food, too Sorry to interrupt  But I found something in it that I don't love this.  Oh, God! Can we make you another one?  Yeah, I'm not sure I could eat another burger.  I'll take it.  Look, we're really sorry about this.  Let us um let us comp your meal.  No, no. Are you sure?  Yes. We insist.  Well, in that case, thank you.  Have a great day!  Huh. This is a brown hair. That's weird.  Makes me wonder how much hair  I've eaten here over the years.  Probably a whole mullet's worth.  - (gags) - Worth it.  So, you're a charming prince, huh?  - Yes, I am. -   And what kind of charmer goes around  kissing dead girls?  I was trying to revive her  with my true-love kiss.  Get off my back!  How many corpses did you kiss  before you found your Snow White, Romeo?  - None. - How many?!  - One. - How many?!  - Four! - How many?!  I don't know!  Why don't you think?!  Ms. Jacobson, help!  Order! Order!  Are you going somewhere with this, Counselor?  No, not really, I just wanted  to upset the witness, Your Honor.  - Looks like you did it. - I did it, yeah.  If there are no further questions,  it's time for the jury to deliberate.  All right, then, I guess  I ask for a mistrial.  It's impossible for my client, the Evil Queen,  to get a fair trial here because  everyone knows the story of Snow White.  Huh. No one has ever asked for a mistrial.  So you'll grant me one?  No. The jury seems impartial and capable.  And mysterious, with a hint of glamor.  Jury, how do you find the defendant?  The impartial, capable, mysterious and glamorous jury  rules in favor of the prosecution.  We find the Evil Queen guilty.  - Shocking. - Sweet Lady Justice!  MR. FROND: No, I didn't!  - Yes, you did! - I-I did not!  What is going on?  Mr. Frond stole my yogurt!  Look! This is his trash can.  Gasp! Right?  I did not eat that yogurt.  It's a crime of passion fruit!  Sounds like you need a lawyer.  Hey, let's try this in student court!  We've already got a judge.  Oh, I mean, we were gonna try  the Three Little Pigs tomorrow.  I'm fine taking this to student court.  Let the whole school see that Mr. Frond is  a dirty yogurt thief!  I am not a thief!  I'd be happy to take this to student court.  Well, I'd preside over this case.  Maybe the fairy tale trials are  - too predictable. - You think?  Let's see what they can do with a real case.  Well, if everyone's on board, I guess  we can try this one tomorrow.  We won't need re-enactors,  so Jimmy Jr., Tammy and Jocelyn  can join the jury.  Jimmy Jr. on the jury?  Jimmy Jury I know who I want to get sequestered with.  He's my sequestiny.  - What? - Nothing.  What happens when you find Frond guilty?  Does this school have the death penalty?  How about if the jury finds him guilty,  he has to wear a sign all day that says,  ""I'm a disgusting yogurt thief.""  Ha, yes!  And, if he's found innocent,  then you have to wear a sign all day that reads,  ""I'm a filthy liar mouth.""  - Perfect! - Tammy and I will make the signs.  It's gonna be so fun.  Jocelyn, will you please make my sign for me?  - Okay. - Thank you.  So we'll keep Zeke as the bailiff,  Gene, you'll be prosecuting,  and, Louise, since you were finally  making some progress as a defender,  you get to defend Mr. Frond.  - Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. - What?  - No, no. (screams) - Ugh!    (fart)  Look, I don't like you, and you don't like me,  but I guess I'm responsible for your defense.  Yes, that's scary, but I'm sure  you'll do everything in your power  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I was gonna go the other way with it.  All you got to do is cop a plea so we can get out of here.  You'll be home in time to talk to your cats  and knit yourself to sleep.  No, no, no, no, no. No deal, I'm innocent.  Who cares! Just say you did it,  buy him a yogurt, and we're done here.  I'm innocent!  Don't hiss at me.  All rise for the somewhat respectable  Judge Conklin.  I guess I brought that on myself.  Today, you, the jury, will hear the case  of Mr. Ambrose v. Mr. Frond,  one of whom will wear the hilarious sign  - we discussed yesterday. -   The signs look really good.  - They're fine. - They look really good.  They're just fine.  (clears throat) I should instruct the jury  that until the trial is over, you may not discuss the case.  Whoa. Forbidden conversation.  So, how about this case, huh?  - What? - I know. We shouldn't.  (whispers): We mustn't.  I-I don't, I-I can't  What-what are you saying?  Exactly.  Let's begin with the opening statements.  (southern accent): As far back as I can remember,  Mr. Ambrose has been hollerin' on  about Mr. Frond stealin' his yogurt.  Why is he talking like that?  Problem was there wasn't no proof!  But now, we have more evidence than an alligator  with a full belly next to an empty crawfish bucket.  I don't understand what he's saying.  Can I interrupt here?  The court asks that you use  your normal speaking voice.  I mean, personally, I really like it,  but it's confusing the jury.  (normal voice): Oh, boo.  Mr. Ambrose's yogurt container was found  in Mr. Frond's trash can.  End of story. I'm good at law!  Applause. Applause!  Ladies and gentleman of the jury,  maybe he didn't do it.  Huh? Good night.  That's it? That's all you got?!  Oh, we also have a right to a speedy trial,  so let's get this going, huh?  Hey, that guy looks familiar.  - Bob, that's Teddy. - Hi, Bob.  No, out the window. I think that's the guy  who found the hair in his burger here yesterday.  Yeah, I think it is.  Hey, Jimmy, did that guy find a hair in his food?  What? Don't yell that across the street!  I'm over here, come on!  That guy was in my place yesterday, Jimmy.  Let me guess, he found a hair on his last bite,  - and you comped his meal? - Yeah.  - That guy is a scammer. - What a jerk!  Lin, who is watching the restaurant?  - Mort and Teddy. - (sighs)  I can't believe that guy was scamming.  He seemed nice we were jib-jabbing about his job.  Don't say jib-jabbing.  Wait, where does he work?  He's, like, a celebrity impersonator.  Like, you rent him for parties.  He gave me a free taste of his Pacino.  It was eye-opening.  Well, maybe we can track him down.  Oh, you want to get back at him, huh?  - Yeah. - Shave his head, cook his hair  and feed it to him?  N-No  Replace all the shoes in his house  with shoes one size smaller.  We AmÃ©lie the guy.  Teddy, is there anyone in the restaurant?  Mort. Oh, nope. There he is.  Something's burning!  - That's where you ate the yogurt, -   but it wasn't yo gurt, was it?!  - No! - Aha! You admit you ate it!  No, I'm saying it wasn't my 'gurt, and I didn't eat it.  Yes, you did. No further questions. Gotcha!  So you walked from here to there.  When, exactly, did you eat the yogurt?  I didn't eat the yogurt!  I'm satisfied.  Uh (clears throat) Louise?  I hate to be that guy,  but you have an obligation  to provide this man with a defense.  Working with what I got, Your Honor.  Let's get this party started.  I call to the stand Ms. Selbo!  Hey, Jimmy Junior, do you think  he's gonna lead this witness or what?  Stop it, Tina, you're gonna get us in trouble.  Guilty as charged.  So, Ms. Selbo, you are a receptionista?  I'm the school receptionist, yes.  And a person in your position  must see and hear a lot of things.  Sitting at the front desk,  watching the race of mankind go by?  Yes, but I'm very discreet.  What do you know about Misters Ambrose and Frond?  Where to begin?  Mr. Frond gets a call from his mother at least once a day.  Oh, there's a surprise.  And Mr. Ambrose uses the computer room  after hours to work on his sequel to Mrs. Doubtfire  ""Mrs. Doubtwater.""  It's a prequel, you ass!  Okay, everyone, okay, I think it's best  we just keep this focused on the yogurt case for now.  Ms. Selbo,  do you have any 'gurt-related gossip?  Any hot 'gurt goss?  Well, Mr. Ambrose is always leaving  his yogurt spoons lying around.  Wait, what do you mean he leaves them lying around?  These yogurts have a plastic spoon in the lid,  for the yogurt eater on the go.  Yeah, or a yogurt thief on the go, like Mr. Frond!  Look at the yogurt container!  The spoon is still in the lid!  - How did I eat it? - Hmm.  Probably with your tongue, like a dirty frog!  Impossible I have a tiny tongue, see?!  Ew, put that away!  - So this is the Internet. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Scroll back up. There he is!  LINDA: Bingo! We got you, buddy.  Austin Powers, Mario or Luigi?  Hey! Borat! Let's get that one!  This isn't supposed to be fun, Teddy.  - Why not? - 'Cause we're getting revenge.  We're gonna do to him what he did to us,  make him work and then not pay.  Ooh, he's available tomorrow.  Wait, what are we just gonna book him?  I mean, he'd recognize us.  He isn't gonna recognize my mother.  Which is why we're gonna book him  for her birthday party.  So Mort, are you sure this won't ruin her party?  Are you kidding? This is her kind of thing.  She loves revenge.  Revenge and shrimp.  Look, it's no use.  That spoon thing went nowhere.  So time to cop a plea, okay?  But I didn't do it.  Falsely accused, huh?  I've been there. All the time.  By you.  All the time? Really?  Well, some of the times. Yeah, really, Mr. Frond.  Well, if I ever did falsely accuse you of anything, I'm sorry.  'Cause this feels really horrible.  Pfft. Well, just save the drama  for the phone call from your mama, okay?  - We're gonna go for the plea deal. - Okay.  Come on, it's our only chance to wait, what?  If you're not gonna defend me,  we should just get this over with.  Okay, great.  Your Honor, my client, um  - Mm-hmm. - My client would like to  - Yes? - Sorry, just a moment.  - So you're really innocent? - Yes.  But really, really innocent?  Yes, that's what I've been telling you. Yes.  Crap. All right.  Your Honor, my client would like to say that he's innocent,  and we're going to keep fighting to prove it, as long as it takes.  I thought you wanted to get this over with.  Yeah, I did, but everyone deserves a fair trial.  Even a broken down, chewed-up,  spit-out guidance counselor like Mr. Frond.  That's the nicest thing you've ever said about me.  Objection! Gross!  So how's the jury going Tina?  We're not supposed to talk about it.  But it's all Jimmy Junior and I can do.  It's intense.  We should've had this thing wrapped up today,  but I guess Louise wants to lose tomorrow.  Oh, I won't be losing, Gene.  I just needed another day to figure out  how to prove Mr. Frond is innocent.  What? Don't you want to see him fry?  I mean, I do.  I did, I really did,  but now I'm pretty sure he didn't do it.  Pretty sure doesn't win trials, toots.  Sounds like this trial is gonna drag on forever.  Darn it. Shucks.  Look, I wish I had someone like me  when I was falsely accused.  I mean, today me, not yesterday me.  Yesterday me was phoning it in.  Aw, my baby's having a crisis of conscience.  You're doing something nice for Mr. Frond.  Ugh! Gross! I am not!  - You like him. - No, I don't!  You like him.  You know what? I'm going to bed to think.  I have to think. I have to go think in bed.  - You think about how you like him. - No, I don't!  Today the defense will prove that Mr. Frond  did not steal the yogurt.  And what's more,  I will show you who did steal the yogurt.  (quietly): As soon as I figure out who that is.  Oh, please, we all know Mr. Frond did it.  The yogurt was in his trash can.  And no one likes him.  I mean, right?  Objection to the first part.  That's hearsay, I think.  It's all hearsay.  You hear it, then you say it.  (laughs)  Oh, that is good.  I will allow it.  Of course you'll allow it.  What won't you allow?  That kind of talk in my courtroom, Missy.  But in this case, I'll allow it.  Wow, this judge sure is permissive.  Ugh. God.  Your Honor? Tina won't stop talking to me about the case  and we're not supposed to do that, right?  Well, technically you're right,  but you're coming off a little whiny.  Ugh. Great.  - You're back. Where were we? - (groans)  Anyway, look at the map.  Mr. Frond's office is between the teacher's lounge  and the cafeteria.  It would've been easy for someone to eat that yogurt  as they walked down the hall, finish it,  and throw it in Mr. Frond's trash can.  So the question is who would've been  in the teacher's lounge after school,  when teachers are rushing out to their second jobs?  Who would've gone from there to the cafeteria?  Oh, I don't know. Wait, yes I do.  Oh, my God! He's right there!  Yes, Mr. Frond was in the teacher's lounge  on Monday afternoon.  But witnesses place two other people there  on that same afternoon.  I call back to the stand Ms. Selbo.  So, Ms. Selbo, you were in the teacher's lounge  just minutes before the yogurt went missing, correct?  Yes, I go there after school and pretend I'm a teacher.  I use Ms. Jacobson's mug.  - What? - I mean, I don't pretend anything  and I use a paper cup.  And I didn't take the yogurt.  And why should we believe you?  I'm lactose intolerant.  - You are? - Big time.  Get me a gallon of milk and I'll prove it.  I will allow it.  No, no, no, we're good.  LINDA: Thanks for letting us crash  your birthday party to get revenge  on a dirty food scammer.  You only turn 86 once!  - (doorbell rings) - Oh, God, is that him?  - Get in the closet! - Just me and Linda, or everybody?  All of us, Teddy!  Mom, we'll be in the closet.  You ladies let him in and enjoy the show.  (all grunting and talking over each other)  LINDA: Ow. Ow!  LOUISE: The defense calls to the stand Mr. Branca.  Mr. Branca, please tell the court what you were doing  in the teacher's lounge after school Monday.  Same thing I do in there every day,  empty the trash, pretend to vacuum.  You know, Branca stuff.  That carpet probably hides dirt.  Yeah. I just make the sound.  (imitates vacuum)  Is someone vacuuming?  So what did you do next?  Well, I walked down the hallway,  mopped up something vomit-ish.  Then what? Then what, Branca?  Picked up some odds and ends,  a broken scrunchie, a few retainers, a spoon  What? Did you just say ""a spoon""?  - Yes. Am I saying that right? Spoon. - Let me get this straight,  you're confessing that you found a spoon Monday after school?  Where did you find it, Branca?  In your mouth?  I find spoons all over the place.  Someone tried to flush a spoon down the toilet  - three times last year. - My bad.  You want me out there finding your spoons.  You need me out there finding your spoons.  I mean, who leaves a spoon on a drinking fountain?  Wait, where did you find the spoon?  On the drinking fountain.  Thank you. I believe you didn't do it.  Oh, thank God.  But I know who did.  Dun, dun, dun!   I have one last question for you, Mr. Branca.  The drinking fountain you found the spoon on,  - how would you describe it? - The squirty one?  The squirty one.  Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,  we all started this trial thinking  Mr. Frond was gross and terrible.  And we still think that.  He's many things:  annoying, desperate.  But he's also something else:  innocent.  Mr. Frond didn't eat Mr. Ambrose's yogurt.  Judge Conklin did.  - (all gasp) - Whoa.  - What? - Oh, my God.  - Oh, my goodness. - Do what?  Order! Order!  That is a very serious accusation, Louise.  - Yeah! - Don't you accuse my judge!  Don't you do it!  Present your argument.  You know, I got suspicious when you mentioned  the carpet in the teacher's lounge probably hides dirt.  It made it sound like you'd been in the teacher's lounge.  But it was something else you said  when you first walked in on Monday.  You said you had an accident, and it was water, not pee.  (gasps) It was pee!  - No, Zeke. It was water. - Oh.  I say Judge Conklin  went into the teacher's lounge  and helped himself to the yogurt,  ate it as he walked down the hall,  threw away the container in Mr. Frond's trash can,  then went to the drinking fountain to wash it down,  leaving the spoon on top.  The squirty fountain did what it does best,  squirted him, hence the wet sleeve.  Wow. You are  100% correct.  (all gasp)  (sobs)  I looked up to you.  What I don't know is why.  Why did you eat a yogurt that did not belong to you?  Yeah, why?  It was an honest mistake.  Usually at these school mock trials  they have some sort of refreshments.  I thought the yogurt was your attempt at that.  I didn't know about this new spoon-in-the-lid technology,  so I just used one of those old-fashioned metal spoons  and I accidentally left it on the fountain.  But why didn't you just admit you did it yesterday?  Why make us go through all of this?  I thought I saw potential in this young defense attorney.  When this case fell in our lap, it seemed like a good challenge.  So this whole time, you were teaching us.  And I have to say, I am impressed.  I like the way you think.  You dug deep to find the truth  and saved an innocent man.  Even though you two clearly have issues.  We do. We do.  Anyway, Mr. Ambrose?  How much was that yogurt?  $2.59, plus tax!  I'll give you $3 and we'll call it square.  Court is adjourned!  I guess I better put this on.  I have a date later.  - It'll be a great ice breaker. -   Bye everyone! Hope you all become lawyers!  Kids, please don't tell your parents  how we've spent the last two days.  (as Borat): My wife.  I, uh, I think he's about to wrap it up.  (grunts)  You like? It's nice.  Oh!  This has to be the finale. Let's go.  Let's go, let's go. Up, up.  (all grunting and talking over each other)  - Move it! - Ow.  Hi, there. Remember us?  You said you found a hair in my baloney cala-zoney?  - And in a burger at Bob's Burgers? - Hi, I'm Teddy.  (normal voice): Oh, yeah. What's going on?  Well, we're really unsatisfied with your performance today.  It's almost like we found a hair in your Borat.  Yeah, we're gonna need this comped.  All right, I see what you're doing here.  Yeah, checkmate. Ha!  You, uh, actually prepaid for the show  when you put your credit card in on the Web site.  No cancellations or refunds one hour prior to performance.  Uh, what? I didn't, I didn't, uh  I didn't know that.  Oh, way to go, Bob. Jeez.  So I guess this isn't checkmate,  more like check the user agreement.  I've never seen a man this naked be this smug.  Thanks for everything and see you guys around.  Not so fast.  Finish your performance.  - What? - You heard him.  We paid for it, we want it all.  We do? I saw enough personally.  - Fine. - (music starts)  (as Borat): I like you, do you like me?  (Teddy laughs)  He he is actually really good.  GENE (in Southern accent): Louise,  I've been a lawyer for three long, sweltering days,  and I know when I've been bested.  Because you lost the case?  Yes. That's when I knew.  I'm just glad the jury came through  and we were able to serve up a hot slice of justice.  I mean, we didn't, but we would have  if we'd been able to deliberate or do anything.  Louise, I want to say thank you.  Honestly, I was terrified the whole time,  but, you did the right thing. And helped me.  I know. It was very big of me.  Right. If you'll excuse me, now that I'm a free man,  I have a reservation for one at the supermarket salad bar.  Ugh. So sad.  Yep. But thank you again.  - I'm proud of you. - Yuck.  Well, it's how I feel, so there you go.  Sorry I didn't believe you in the first place.  - What? - Nothing!  Hey, hey   Yogurt, hey, yogurt, hey   Yogurt, yogurt, yogurt   Yogurt, hey, yogurt, hey   Yogurt, hey   Yogurt, yogurt, yogurt    Hey, hey   Hey, yogurt."
"1  And now I present my history project  about ancient Greece.  I, uh, had some big plans.  There was gonna be a musical component,  there was a graphic novel in the works,  and, well, what can I say?  Some projects just, uh, don't get off the ground.  So, without further ado,  I present the Acropolis, made out of Popsicle sticks.  The A-popsicol-is!  Oh wow!  Who's Miss Twitchell to accuse me  of giving up when things get hard?  She's the divorcÃ©e, not me not yet.  Well, you do give up, like, all the time.  I mean, you're a starter, not a finisher.  Which the world needs.  Without starters, how would we, um  - Finish anything? - Exactly.  You know what I need? A little chocolate pick-me-up.  Fortunately, I think I might have some candy  in my backpack.  What? That's impossible.  No, he probably does.  Uh-oh, last one.  All right, little Chunky Blast Off,  a lot of pressure on you.  Come on, now, do what you do to me.  Don't be nervous. You're gonna be great.  Ready to blast off?  Uh, yeah.  PILOT: Ooh  Aah  Sisters, won't you join me  as I stop at the store to purchase  another box of this timeless classic?  LOUISE: You get so charming when you eat chocolate.  What the ?  New look, ""new great taste""?  They put sunglasses on the astronaut guy!  And gave him frosted tips!  - What about the ""new great taste"" part? - I'm so scared. Here goes.  No, no, no, eh, eh, bleh  Why?! Why, why, why, why, why?!  - So not great? - Bleh! Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!  Or what's the verdict?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, kid, you got to pay for that.  Why would they do this to me?  Why would they change Chunky Blast Offs?  And where's Ronnie?  I want my usual convenience store checkout guy!  Ronnie joined the Peace Corps.  No!  - (door bells jingle) - TEDDY: Hey, guys.  How you doing?  You mind if I use your dishwasher? Mine's busted.  Uh, yes. 'Cause we're a restaurant.  Great.  Teddy, those are golf balls.  Good eye, Bob. Good eye.  Why are you washing golf balls?  'Cause they're dirty.  I got 'em at the bottom of the lake  at the municipal golf course.  I clean 'em and then I sell 'em back to the golfers.  I make a quarter each.  That's about, uh, 75 bucks in there.  Wow, that's sort of impressive.  But keep that to yourself.  I'm not exactly on good terms  with management at the course right now.  Okay. Wait, why?  Guys at the pro shop wanted a cut.  But I'm the one risking my life, right?  Diving into a murky lake at night  with nothing but a garden hose for air.  I've said too much.  I can trust you, right, Bob? Right?  I don't got to worry about you, right?  - Just, take it - You're not gonna tell anyone, right?  - Take it easy. - Just keep it to yourself, okay?  - I-I won't tell anybody. - Just I know how you get.  - I Run out of things to talk about, - They're just golf balls.  and then next thing you're telling  everybody that comes in here about  Teddy, there's no reason to insult me  when you're using my dishwasher.  Here, you know what?  Just keep your mouth shut, okay?  Uh, here's a little taste.  Buy something nice for yourself.  They changed Chunky Blast Offs! They changed Chunky Blast Offs!  What?! What happened? What happened?  They changed Chunky Blast Offs.  What are Chunky Blast Offs?  The best thing this country's produced since ankle socks.  They messed with Gene's candy, and now he's a big old mess.  Aw, I hate it when they change candies.  I hate it!  So now I'm gonna get the geniuses  at Spratt's Sweets to change it back.  Spratt's Sweets dot com, and click.  Live chat? Sure.  ""What can we help you with today?""  Hmm. Change Chunky Blast Offs back, you idiots.  Sorry for the ""you idiots"" part.  Margaret is typing.  ""Currently there are no plans to change the formula  ""of Chunky Blast Offs,  ""but your comments have been noted.  Have a delicious day""?!  Well, I'm shocked that didn't work.  Aw, I gave it a shot. Time to give up.  That's the spirit.  (gasps) No.  Time to Un-give up.  The factory tour!  Factory tour?  They have free factory tours  every day except Christmas, which is fine,  because I'm busy on Christmas.  We'll go to the Spratt's factory tour,  and I'll get my day in candy court!  You're talking crazy, Gene.  No, I'm not!  I'll take you on the tour.  - Wait, what? - Yeah.  I'm proud of Gene for taking a stand.  You little Erin Choco-vich, you.  But they're probably not gonna listen to a kid, Lin.  Of course, I know.  But we should support Gene's cause.  - Oh, it's a cause now? - It's a cause. Support it.  I think you just want to go on the tour.  (chuckles): What? I don't even like candy.  Ach! Ptuh! Cavities. Cavity creeps. Ech.  As you can see, we still make our candy  the same way that our founder, Ferdinand Spratt, did  over 80 years ago, but with robots.  Excuse me, Michelle.  Is there gonna be, like, a Q & A  with the boss man or boss woman of this place at the end of the tour?  Yeah, my brother's got some Qs that need As.  Spratt's Sweets is governed by its board of directors.  And unless you're a stockholder, little fella,  they're just a bit too busy to answer questions.  But we came all this way so my brother could  talk to someone in charge.  Hey, anyone ever wonder how we keep  all the wrappers organized?  - Kinda. - Sorry, Gene.  We'll get you something nice at the gift shop.  Unless you're too sad to enjoy it,  and then we'll just get me something.  (grumbling)  At the end of this hall,  we'll all take turns looking through a window  into the accounting office.  The Ferdinand Spratt?  (door creaks)  Are you Ferdinand Spratt, as in Spratt's Sweets?  Yeah, you're talking to the last living Spratt.  - Who are you? - My name's Gene, and I'm a huge fan  of Spratt's Sweets.  Did you peel off from the factory tour?  - How'd you know? Hair net? - Yep. It's an awful tour.  - So awful! - Who's your tour guide?  - Michelle? - Yup.  Figures. She's the only one.  Look, I came all this way to talk to someone in charge.  But now I've met you, the most in-charge person  in the whole place.  Technically speaking, yeah.  So what can I do for you?  (sighs) Your company changed Chunky Blast Offs,  and I really, really, really want you  to change them back.  Let's say by Monday at the latest.  - That's it? - That's it.  - Done. - Wait, really?  - Yeah. - Oh, wow, great. So it's done?  Well, not done. It's gonna be,  like, a whole thing with the suits,  but from one mega Spratt's fan to another,  I promise to help.  Yes! Thank you, Ferdie!  But first, I need your help.  I want to tie licorice whips to the ceiling fan  to make a licorice tornado,  but I'm scared to go to the top of the ladder  without someone holding it.  Uh, licorice tornado? Yeah.  (both gulping)  So while we're stuck on the tour learning  about how humidity affects nougat,  Gene sneaks off and becomes BFFs  with the founder's grandson.  And if you thought nougat likes lots of humidity,  you'd be wrong dead wrong.  And we're all sure this guy's actually  who he says he is?  I'm just saying, he is a stranger  giving Gene candy.  The best kind of stranger.  And he's gonna put the old Chunky Blast Offs back in orbit.  - Because it's space? - I get it.  Well, Ferdie said it's not entirely up to him.  He has to convince someone called the ""board of directors.""  So how is he going to do that?  That's what Ferdie and I are gonna figure out tomorrow.  - Tomorrow? - Yeah, I'm going back  there after school to work on our plan.  Really? Lin, you're gonna take him there again?  Yeah. He's fighting for something he believes in.  And he could put it down on his rÃ©sumÃ© someday.  ""Fought the Man, saved candy, cute as a button.""  Th-That's not a great rÃ©sumÃ©.  Is there any other reason you want to take him?  - (mutters) - You didn't want to maybe  buy more candy in the gift shop, Lin?  What? There's a gift shop?  GENE: Okay, let's see,  how are we gonna get those suits upstairs  to listen to us?  Good question. Oh, hey,  I haven't given you the cool tour.  Want to do that before we get crackin'?  Uh  So I get to drive these whenever I want.  They go up and down, back and forth.  - Whatever you're into. - Yeah, cool.  So should we start coming up with ideas?  I feel like our meeting got a little sidetracked.  Okay, yeah, let's brainstorm real quick.  Uh, hmm. Oh, hey!  So they just let me come in here  and throw these up against the glass.  They love it. Wanted to make sure I showed you this.  What a tour. Thank you.  But now let's figure out  how you're gonna talk to your office business people.  Well, nowadays, business isn't done in offices.  Business is done walking really fast  down long hallways and at urinals.  Haven't you seen Entourage?  Is it a show about people peeing and getting stuff done?  - Yeah, more or less. - Then do that. Do the urinal plan.  Uh, but what about the lady board members?  We'll have to convince them to use the urinals.  (chuckles) Leave that to me.  All right, how's this for a urinal opener?  ""Look what's coming out of the business end of that thing!  Speaking of business ""  And then you speak of business.  I like it. It's good.  Hey, call it a day?  Okay, but we haven't really figured out much  besides my great opening line.  Yeah, I know, but I usually try  to knock out a nap around this time,  and so I just feel like, you know,  it's the right time to do it.  And, wow, you are going to sleep.  I will show myself out  after taking one Uncle Nuts bar off your desk.  So, you come up with your plan?  Sort of. It seems like Ferdie  doesn't really want to put in the work.  Like, at all. Wow, it's weird to hear  those words coming out of my mouth.  He says we'll nail it down tomorrow.  Sure, sure, you'll get it tomorrow.  Hey, this'll be our after-school  snack-tivity this week. (chuckles)  So you sold all your balls?  - Sold all the balls. - You don't sound happy.  I just keep thinking about the sunken treasure  that I left behind in the deeps.  - In the what? - The deeps.  It's what I call the deep part of the lake.  - Nine feet deep. - Mm-hmm.  No light. No life. No sound.  Man's alone with his thoughts down there, Bobby.  Except for some tadpoles.  There's plenty of tadpoles down there.  What's the sunken treasure?  Thousands of balls, but, uh, I can't get to 'em.  I'd be diving deeper than I'd ever gone before.  I need someone to feed me the hose, keep a lookout.  But, uh, who could I get, you know?  What do I do? What do I do?  Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.   Probably never go back, call it quits.  - Right. Team up! - No.  - It'd be you and me! - No, not team up.  Yeah, come on, Bob, one last score,  and then we're done, we're out, we're set for life.  - Teddy, I-I - Right? No looking back.  - I don't think so. - What do you want to do, Bob?  Work in this dead-end job the rest of your life,  - flipping burgers? - Teddy  You didn't exactly light the world on fire, Bob.  - Wait, what? What? No. - You know what I mean?  It's great, you got a restaurant here, but come on.  - All right, I'll do it. - What? Really?  I don't have to go in, right? You go in.  - What? - I just have to hold the thing.  Sure, if that's all you want to do.  I mean, if you only want to live life that much,  you just could hold the thing, I suppose.  You really don't want to go in the water?  No, I will not go in the water.  I thought that's why you were gonna do it.  You want to go in the water with me.  - No, I don't want to dive - I thought we would be  fighting over the hose. No?  I don't want to dive into a scummy pond.  Really? You got no Jacques Cousteau in you, huh, Bobby?  I've eaten you, I've eaten you, I've eaten you  Oh, you're new. What's your situation?  Beatrice, loving the new 'do.  N-Nothing's changed. It's the same 'do.  Mm. It's different. Maybe you didn't wash it.  Ferdie? Gene's here.  - Again. - Hey, Gene.  Hey, Ferdie. Ready to brainstorm? Perfect our pee pee pitch?  Yeah, listen, I've been thinking.  I'm not so sure the urinal plan is gonna work.  Why not?  Because I almost tried it, and it was, like, awkward.  I couldn't even tell you if that guy was a board member.  I mean, he had a suit on,  he had a penis, he looked familiar.  Okay, we'll come up with another plan.  I don't know. We've already put, like, a ton of work into it.  Let's face it, it's gonna be way too hard to convince the board  to change Chunky Blast Offs back.  - Wait, you're giving up? - Not exactly.  Wait, yes. Exactly.  First your company betrays me and now you!  What is it with this place?!  Maybe the next candy you make should be called  ""Betrayal Brittle,"" or something that has the word betrayal in it  'cause you're all experts at betrayal! Betrayal mix!  - You're the betrayer! - What?!  - Beatrice, who's betraying who? - Sorry, what's going on?  That's right. She's on my side.  I think Gene needs to go.  And he's not allowed in my office anymore.  So you want me to call security?  That won't be necessary. I'm leaving.  Beatrice, please page my mom in the gift shop,  tell her I'll be by the car and that I'm not crying at all!  (panting)  (grunts, groans)  I'm sorry Ferdinand turned out to be such a turd-inand.  But, Gene, we're proud of you. You gave it your best shot.  Yeah, Gene, you got closer than any of us thought you would.  (groans)  Okay, we'll leave you alone  and let you have farty time on the couchies.  If Ferdie had just stuck to the urinal plan, it would've worked.  Well, maybe someone else needs to step up now.  You started this crazy candy ride,  now finish it, you son of a bitch!  Wow! I love motivational speeches.  Now I know what it must be like to play basketball.  Here's what you're gonna do: you're gonna go  into the board room and convince them yourself.  But I can't get in there!  I'm not allowed on the executive floors.  But you can still take the factory tour.  Why would I want to do that? It was terrible.  The mail room was nice.  No, the tour is just our cover.  We'll peel off from the group  and sneak Gene into the board meeting.  Really? You'd do that for me?  If it means watching you barge into  a board of directors meeting half-cocked, then yes I will.  - I think we're good, Bobby. - Mm-hmm.  - I think we're finally good to go. - Mm.  We'll enter by the 16th and then we'll cut across.  - Did you bring your ski mask? - No. Did you?  Uh You brought gloves though, right?  - No. - No?  - No! - Did I not say this?  - I No, you didn't - I told you to bring a ski mask!  - I told you to bring gloves, no? - No. You d-definitely didn't.  - I definitely didn't say that? - Oh, my God.  Okay. You're frustrated, you're scared. That's okay. But listen.  Don't let the dogs smell that fear on you.  - You know? - Dogs? What dogs?  Wait, you have padding on your arms?  - Yeah, but, uh - Is that for the dogs?  No, it's just from, uh, another thing.  From Rollerblading. But, yeah, no, now that you say it,  it's probably gonna help with the dogs. You're probably right.  Wait, have you been bitten by these dogs?  No. I mean, yes, once, but that's why I got the padding.  - Yeah, but I don't have the padding. - No.  You didn't say bring padding.  No, but I also didn't tell you that I got bit by a dog.  Oh, my God. Why did I do this?  - All right, light me up. - Here you go.  - (gasps) - You okay?  (gagging): Oh!  - I'm gonna be fine. - You were just  This always happens the first time.  I know, but you were, like, down there for, like,  just, like, two seconds.  - You barely went down. - I just got scared.  Okay. (coughing)  Are you okay? You're choking?  - Breathe in through the hose. - I am. I'm using the hose.  - I'm trying to (gags) - Teddy, you're vomiting.  It's making me g (gags)  - You said you've done this before.  - It's making me gag.  - Maybe I try it once without the hose. - No, you can't go  That's why I'm here. Just go down.  (gagging) I'm ch Oh, my God.  I'm gagging every time I try it, Bobby.  Dive down, Teddy.  (gasps)  - All right. - Did you get any?  Yeah, I got, like, three and a couple in my pocket.  Well, go back down.  Don't tell me what to do, Bobby!  I'm not leaving here with three balls!  I can't get that extra foot.  That's why they call it the deeps.  Teddy, go back down and get more.  All right I'm going, I'm going. Just, uh, give me a second.  Teddy, you said there were a thousand balls down there.  All right, I'm going down one more t one more time.  Great. Go.  (gagging)  Ugh.  - So, how you gonna spend your share? - Teddy, shh.  - SkyMall? - Shh.  Why? We can be loud at this point.  MAN: Hey! Who's over there?!  Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go!  (both panting)  - (dogs barking) - Oh, my God. You hear that?  Dogs! Oh, my God!  - Aah! Golf cart. - (grunts)  - Uh - St-Stairs!  - Stairs! - I got to take 'em!  - No, no, no, no! - I got to take 'em, Bobby!  If we don't make it, I love you.  I friggin' love you.  - I love you, too. - Yeah!  Let's do it!  (both screaming)  Aah! We're losing all the golf balls!  - Bobby, hold on to them! - Oh, oh, oh!  (laughing) That was great!  TEDDY: We did it!  Good luck breaking into the candy board room.  I'm gonna break into a giant bag of deformed candy  that only costs a buck.  (laughs)  Hey, you three look familiar.  Didn't you just take the tour last weekend?  We're kids; we like candy.  - Now tour us. - (laughs): Whoa!  Now let's go have a look at  the candy-making equipment getting cleaned and dried.  Okay, so where's this display  we're gonna Trojan horse you in with?  There's a room full of those dumb new Chunky Blast Offs  displays right through here.  GENE: All right, just get me in the  elevator and up into the board room.  The meeting's about to start.  Hey, you're not supposed to be here.  - Busted. - Oh, no. (chuckles)  We got separated from the super interesting factory tour.  It happens. Come on, I'll get you back  before you miss too much.  Oh, no. You don't have to do that.  Yeah, you probably have to patrol.  No, no. It's no trouble at all.  - Sounds like a lot of trouble. - No, you know what? Yeah, it does.  - It's really not. - We don't want to bother you.  Hey, did you see how they print the boxes yet?  We did not.  - Uh, we did, and - We did.  Believe me, if you saw it, you'd remember it.  That's for sure.  You got your hairnets? Where's your hairnet?  Uh I got a couple in my pocket here.  Here you go. You can keep those, you know.  - What? No. - Come on, let's go.  (groans) Oh, no, it's please.  - Come on. - All right, all right, all right!  (whispers): What's happening?  You got to get to the board room.  We'll meet you there.  Oh, sure, that'll be easy.  (sighs) Well, here goes nothing (grunts)  (elevator bell dings)  Bringing their promotion items down here, huh?  Well, they're always coming up with new things, those guys.  (grunts)  And the peanut blight in Puerto Rico  really was a blight on this fiscal quarter  - (laughing) -  as you can see from that  What? I don't get it.  Why is that rocket coming in here?  Oh. (Gene grunts)  What's going on?  Is it someone's birthday?  - Ugh! - Gene?  (panting) Give me a sec.  What are you doing here?  I came here to say the stuff that needs saying  that you didn't have the guts to say so I'm gonna!  I know he's just a little boy, but I'm calling 9-1-1.  - No. - Hey.  You are gonna listen to him.  Gene's my friend, and I betrayed him.  And he's gonna talk, and we're all gonna listen.  And if I tune out a little, it's only because  I know most of what he's about to say.  All right, fine, you-you've got two minutes.  Thanks, Ferdie. Look, I really care about Chunky Blast Offs.  And you people changed them, and now they taste gross  and the astronaut guy looks creepy.  I'm sure you have your dumb reasons,  but the original Chunky Blast Offs used to taste so good  and meant so much to me.  And now that they're gone, I feel like  a part of me went with them.  Are you trying to say a part of your childhood went away?  Huh? Oh, uh, I don't know Hey, man, I was on a roll.  All right, sorry, sorry. Just continue.  (sighs) You people bring happiness to millions of kids.  But then it's like you gave up on us.  And I know a little something about giving up.  Until a few days ago, I was known as a chronic giver-upper.  Are you trying to say ""quitter""?  Please!  Don't you people remember what it's like  to care about your favorite candy?  Or have you been dressing up in business suits  and drinking business water for so long  that you don't even remember?  This is just water, just normal  I don't know what ""business water"" is.  - You, guy with the glasses. - Huh? Hey.  When was the last time you even ate one of the candies you make?  I-I don't know, a year? Maybe two?  A year? That's crazy!  What about you, lady with the turtle pin?  Oh. Uh, a couple months ago, maybe?  - What's your favorite candy? - I don't know.  - I haven't given it any thought. - Come on, come on!  Just think back when you were a kid,  before you were this soulless  Watch it.  Come on, you know the answer.  - A Goshdarnit Bar! - Ah! Good!  What about you?  Sp-Sprickle-Sprackles.  Go on, dig in!  - Whoa. - Wow. This is really different  than the accounting office.  - Come on, be a kid again! - WOMAN: Ow.  Sorry, I just hit someone in the head.  (laughs): It was me. It's fine. It's not a big deal.  - Your eye is bleeding. - So, who's with me?!  Let's change Chunky Blast Offs back!  - I second it. - I third.  - Hooray! - You changed my opinion.  All right. Well, it looks like we'll be  changing back to the original Chunky Blast Offs after all.  It's unanimous.  - (whoops) - Yes.  Yes! Ha-ha! I can't believe it!  - Atta-way, Gene! - Hoorah. Huzzah.  - Did Gene really just do that? - Looks like it.  Al, get me a cost breakdown and a timeline  for putting the old formula and the packaging back online.  Uh, sure. I can estimate that.  It's gonna be, uh, somewhere between  15 and 20 million dollars.  Oh, then forget it.  - That's no. - All right.  You did great in there, Gene. You should feel proud.  You saw it through. You kept with it.  Yeah, but we failed.  No, Gene, you failed.  - Huh. - FERDIE: No, no.  You totally nailed it.  You reminded those suit-bags  what really matters to a candy company: kids.  - And money. - And money.  Hey, we've got, like, 20, 30,000 old formula  Chunky Blast Offs in the warehouse.  You want 'em?  Ah, yeah. (moaning)  I feel good. Do you guys feel good?  Oh, my heart's beating like crazy. (chuckles)  I'm sure it's fine. Let's go. I'll drive.  Look at that thing. It's gonna last you into your 20s.  - I give it a month. - I give it a week.  And I will spend that week in this box.  Please forward my mail to this address.  (grunting)  - Gene, give me one. Give me one. - No! No.  - Give it! Give it to me! - No.  In the mood for a little chocolate   I want more of that chunky rocket   Do what you do to me   So good and so chunky   Ready to blast off?   Blast off   Blast off   Chunky, Chunky Blast Off   Ooh, Hoo   Said Blast Off   Chunky, Chunky Blast Off   Ooh, Hoo   Yeah, Blast Off."
"1    Okay. Thanks, Mr. Frond.  I'm gonna be the most fun chaperone you ever worked with.  I'll be your one and chaperone-Ly.  - (laughs) Oh, he hung up. - So you're in, Mom?  Yeah. Me and my teeny Tina are off to the Heroine Conference.  Heroin Conference?  What do you mean, like a jazz concert?  That really isn't the best name.  What would you call  a weekend-long empowerment gathering for girls  with speeches from important female leaders?  Sex and the City 3.  Oh, I can't wait.  We haven't had special Mama-Tina time  since we got stuck in the elevator  at your orthodontist's.  Aw, we thought we were gonna die, remember?  Yeah.  And, uh, what are we gonna do while they're gone?  Enjoy all that extra room without their boobs in the way?  Mm Maybe something easy that costs nothing?  - Tickle party? - Eh.  - Armpit farts? - Hmm, I'd Yeah, I'd do that.  - (children chattering) - FROND: Okay, listen up.  - Listen up. - This is an overnight field trip.  And you are teenagers.  - So we are not fooling around here. - Nope.  If you break the rules, you will be sent home.  - That's right. - Notice this firm, commanding voice?  It's my tough voice.  And when ya hear it, ya better fear it.  So let's hear it. Let's hear that tough voice.  - Come on. - What? I just did it. That-that was it.  - That was That was the tough - Oh. That was it.  - That was it right there. - That was it.  Oh, my God, Tammy,  I'm so glad we're rooming together.  Me, too. We're gonna stay up late  and pretend it's our apartment  and we're so tired of the dating scene.  Who are you rooming with, Tina?  I'm rooming with a cool, older girl  who happens to be married to my dad.  - The bus driver? - No, my mom.  - Me! Up top. - Here you go.  (sarcastically): Cool.  - Yeah. - Very cool.  All right, people, as many of you know,  this year's Heroine Conference keynote  is being delivered by none other than Bernadette Baker.  - Who's she? - She's an astronaut  who flew two missions to the International Space Station  and is also a black belt in karate.  - We're reading her book in class. - Ooh.  She's so mad at the Moon. I love it.  Linda, please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Here's something fun and mandatory  Write down one question for Ms. Baker.  If the conference people pick your question,  you'll get to ask it yourself during the Q&A.  Whoa. Did you hear that, Mom?  Huh? What? No.  I-I'm a chaperone, I don't have to listen to him.  There's our guy.  So (sighs) no dames tonight.  Just us boys. So what are we doing?  Yeah, wow us, Pops.  Uh, we could watch a movie.  Maybe, like, a guy movie?  Hmm. Like what?  Magic Mike? Finally?  Maybe. Maybe not.  Maybe something else.  Great. Let's close up this slop shop  and get to it.  We're not closing early, Louise.  Why not? The only person who comes in here is Teddy,  and you can just leave his burger on the sidewalk.  - Yeah, like Mom does.  - Wait, what?  She puts 'em on a plate.  It's called class.  Wow. I've never seen  so many girls my age in one place before.  That's because we don't tell you where we hang out.  (both laughing)  It's not the mall.  Okay, do I have everyone's questions  for the astronaut?  Let's see. Tammy Larson asks,  ""How do you poop in space?""  It's a serious question.  How does anyone poop anywhere?  Okay. ""How do you pee in space?""  ""How do you poop in space?"" Another pee.  ""How do aliens poop?"" Okay, here we go.  ""Who inspired you to go to space?""  A thoughtful question from Tina.  - Thanks, Mr. Frond. - (exhales)  Glad we didn't go with the poop question, huh?  I know.  Mrs. Belcher, would you mind getting us checked in?  Sure. Check me out, getting checked in.  Nice, Mom.  What chapter are you on?  Uh, the one before she goes to space  but after she started karate.  That's a good one.  I'm Tina. But my friends call me Blaze.  They don't. I don't know why I said that.  (chuckles) I'm Dillon.  I hear that.  Sorry. I don't know why I said that, either.  It's okay.  (sighs): I get this way on field trips.  I get it. When I went to camp,  I said my name was Dallas, and I was from Houston.  I hear that.  - Hey, it kind of worked that time. - Yeah.  Okay, it looks like your block of rooms  is good to go.  Make sure to join us for the buffet breakfast  by our beautiful water feature.  LINDA: Ooh, water feature.  Smells like chlorine. Nice!  Now, for your room, would you like one key or two?  Two. For me and my daughter slash BFF.  - We're roomies. - That's so sweet.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  Right? Wait, what?  Hi, I'm Amy.  I'm a chaperone this weekend.  Hi. Me, too. Linda.  What do you mean, ""Enjoy it while it lasts""?  Well, how old's your daughter?  Thirteen.  Oh. Yeah.  My daughter's 13, too.  When we started the year, she let me talk to her.  And be seen with her.  And chew food around her.  You can't chew food around her?  To be fair, I chew weird.  I chew weird.  Really weird.  Aw, but Tina's Tina.  She's Mama's little girl.  That's your daughter? She's talking to my daughter.  (gasps) They're coming over here. How do I look?  - Mom, can I - Mom, I want to  - Wait, is that ? - Oh, are you ?  This is your mom, too? Are we sisters?  This is fun.  The chaperone-ettes find each other in a crowd.  - Hi, Dillon! - No, thanks.  Okay! (laughs nervously)  Mom, Dillon and I were wondering if we could room together?  What? Room together? What?  I was gonna have a room to myself,  but this'll be more fun.  Oh, then I could room with you, Linda.  I was gonna drive home tonight  and then drive back in the morning.  It's just four hours away.  Tina, what about our mommy-daughter weekend?  Mom, please?  Uh, okay. Sure. But if you change your mind,  - I'll be right here in the - Yay! Thanks, Mom.  Welcome to the Rejected Moms Club.  It's probably a joke. Yeah, and  (elevator bell dings)  Tina's gonna come back any second and say,  ""Not!"" Or ""Psyche!""  - (elevator bell dings) - See?  There's my little girl.   I accidentally pushed the ""door open"" button. Bye, Mom.  - (bell dings) - Oh.  So, two chaperones sharing a room.  Do you snore? 'Cause I snore.  It would be fun if we both snored.  I can't believe Tina ditched me  for some girl she just met.  Eh, they'll like us again by the time they're 30.  Get a hobby. I scrapbook.  That's Dillon's report card.  That's a thing she dropped in the car.  Huh. Lot of pictures of her sleeping.  Mm-hmm. It's almost as good  as actually hanging out with Dillon and talking to her.  - Right. That's not completely sad. - No, it is.  Okay. Uh, I'm gonna go check on Tina.  You sure you don't want to scrap it out with me?  - Aah  - Little scrap sesh?  - No - I have scalloping shears.  - Snip, snip. - Uh  No. No, thanks. No snip, snip.  BOB: Okay.  Guy movies. Uh, I've got a young Clint Eastwood.  Nice.  - I've got middle-aged Charles Bronson. - Yes.  - And I've got old Michael Caine.  - Mm.  And I've got Bachelor Party,  which is probably not appropriate.  Tom Hanks in the '80s? Please and Hank you.  Well, at least that's got ""party"" in the title.  What even happens at a bachelor party, anyway?  Like, what happened at yours, Dad?  Uh, I'm not sure I had one.  That good, huh?  Oh, my God. This is perfect.  - Wait. What's perfect? - Don't you see?  This is the Mom-less,  Tina-free fun we've been looking for.  Dad, we're gonna give you  the bachelor party you never had.  A dad-chelor party.  Guys, no. I don't want a bachelor party.  - I don't need one at all. - BOTH: Dad-chelor party!  One last night of fun  before you marry that old bag Linda.  Hi, Mom.  Uh, what's up?  Just checking in.  - Oh, wh - Yeah, whatcha doing?  What's this?  Reading tarot cards.  Which I have done before.  As you well know.  Ooh, tarot cards, freaky.  Come on, deal me in. What's wild?  Uh, Mom, it doesn't work that way.  Good chaperoning, though.  I think we're all set here. Good night.  Oh, I get what's going on.  You think the mean, pretty chaperone  came to crack down on your fun.  Well, I left my chaperone hat in my room.  My room key, too. I forgot my room key.  - Ha. Good one, Linda. Ha. - Well, sounds like  you got a lot going on, so  Hey, I got an idea.  How about we get out of this stuffy old room  and do something really fun?  But Mr. Frond said if we leave the room we'll get sent home.  Aw, don't worry about Mr. No-Fun Frond.  You're with me.  Wow, Tina. Your mom's a lot.  That's right, random new friend.  Come on, let's do it!  Fun, right?  We're walking around.  Ooh, look, someone got room service.  Mom, this was nice but I think Dillon and I should go back now.  Why? We haven't even gotten to the fun part yet.  What is the fun part?  The fun part, Dillon, is we're gonna  take the fries and spell out ""hello.""  In fries! Ha! Great prank.  And that's a prank because ?  Well, if you don't get it, you don't get it.  LOUISE: Another round of shots, gentlemen?  Ugh. I think I've had all the apple juice  I can stomach, Louise.  That's a yes. Gene?  Yeah! Speeches! Speeches!  Let me tell you something about this son of a bitch.  Gene's cut off. No speech.  Oh, boo.  Having a good time, Dad?  Oh, yeah.  - Should we call it a night? - (doorbell rings)  - I'll get it! - Oh, no. Who's at the door?  Maybe somebody ordered a sexy surprise?  - (door opens) - TEDDY: Bachelor party!  - You invited Teddy? - We kept it small.  What, do you want to go wide with this list?  Make room on the couch, Bob. Make room.  Uh Louise, pour me one.  - Hit me. - Bam. Here's one.  Give me another one.  I got to catch up. (gulps)  There it goes.  Soda in the elevator.  Yup. There it goes.  Perfect prank.  (yawning): Oh, yawn.  Dillon, are you yawning?  I think we're both yawning.  (yawning): Oh, yeah.  Maybe we should both go to bed.  Bed? What?  But the most fun part hasn't happened yet.  We're gonna, uh Huh.  Mom? What are you doing?  I don't know, what am I doing?  Just popping the top off this little bottle of shampoo,  and, uh (grunts)  - TINA: Mom, no! - Whoa.  It's fun! You do it.  I don't really want to.  What about you, Dillon? Huh?  Better than tarot cards, right?  Uh, I don't know if you can really compare the two?  Aw, party sham-poopers.  It's starting to foam.  Come on, get in on this.  HOTEL MANAGER: Our water feature!  Is someone throwing shampoo into our water feature? No!  Okay. Uh, uh, okay. All right.  Let's go. Let's go. Just go.  Oh, Mr. Frond!  - Linda. - Oh, no.  Yeah. As in, ""Oh, no, you didn't.""  Eh, at least he didn't do his tough voice.  That was my tough voice.  Yeah, no, yeah.  (dance music playing)  Eh, ah, ooh, ah.   Gene, seriously, no more apple juice for you.  I can't believe you're getting married, Bobby!  - (crying) - (phone ringing)  Teddy, maybe take it down a notch.  Hello? Sorry, I, uh, I can't hear you.  Guys, turn the music down!  - I heard, ""Turn it up""? - (volume increases)  - Bob? - Linda? Is everything okay?  I need you to come here.  What? You're two hours away.  What's going on?  Uh, there's been some trouble,  and someone's getting sent home.  (sighs) Sorry, I can't hear you.  Guys, volume.  Pressing bass boost.  Tina's being sent home?  Uh, someone else.  Guys, please! Sorry, Lin,  we're having a bachelor party.  He's getting cold feet, Mom.  This phone call's not helping.  - I said - Aah! (music stops)  I got in trouble and I'm getting sent home!  - Oh, my God. - I dance-kicked the stereo.  Oh you're on the phone. Sorry, Bob.  (sighs) Thanks for waiting for your dad with me, Tina.  Ha. It's not the silent treatment,  if that's what you're thinking.  She's probably just trying to come up  with the perfect little joke to lighten up the mood.  Sometimes it takes her hours.  - Hi, everyone. This is awkward. - LOUISE: You think?  GENE: I don't know, I'm liking the vibe.  Now that your ride is here, I'm going to get some rest.  I suggest you do the same, Tina.  You're gonna be talking to Bernadette Baker tomorrow.  What? Tina, they picked your question?  Why didn't you tell me?  I wanted to, Mom, but you were too busy  embarrassing me and being crazy!  (laughs nervously)  I'm not sure that lightened the mood.  Linda, what did you do, exactly?  - Nothing. It was nothing. - It wasn't nothing.  We have a beautiful water feature in our courtyard  and your wife threw shampoo bottles into it.  The courtyard is covered in lather.  I guess we're calling anything a courtyard these days, huh?  Please remove your wife. She is no longer welcome here  at the Brewster Courtyard Gardens Hotel.  But your motto is ""You're always welcome  at the Brewster Courtyard Gardens Hotel.""  - Not you! Not anymore. - Mom?  - Yes, sweetie? - You should just go.  - You really embarrassed me tonight. - Tina, no. I'm going to bed.  I can't remember which room I'm in, but I'm sure I'll recognize the door.  She's gonna be wandering around up there all night.  LOUISE: Yep. She belongs to the hotel now.  Embarrassed her? I embarrassed her?  Dad, we're not driving all the way back tonight, are we?  I mean, (scoffs) it's after midnight.  Well, it's not like we can stay here.  Your mom is banned. A lot.  Hello? There's a motel right across the street.  - Ugh. - Yes!  Every good dad-chelor party  ends at a motel just like that.  Well, I am really tired.  There's the party animal.  (light crackling)  (sighs)  It's not like Tina to blow me off like that.  She didn't mean anything by it.  I mean, she definitely meant it.  But she won't tomorrow. As much.  I mean, let's sleep.  We should just sleep.  No way! Bachelor party rules:  you can pass out but you can't sleep.  Fine, I'm passing out.  Then I guess you're cool with your face being drawn on.  Mm if it's tasteful.  - Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. - Oh, yeah.  (snoring)  (muttering fitfully)    LINDA: There she is.  My teeny Tina.  (baby noises)  Aw.  Tina, Wha what's going on?  You're embarrassing me, Mom!  What the ?  (panting)  Tina. Don't run away from Mommy.  (grunting)  (yells)  Hi, Linda!  Want to borrow my scalloping shears?  (echoing): Shears, shears  No !  (gasps) Scalloping shears!  (exhales) I'm losing Tina.  Mm I want scallops.  BOB: I got most of the pen off my face.  Thanks, guys, for that.  Wait'll you see what we wrote on your back.  Lin, you coming?  What if Hear me out for a second  - This is gonna be good. - Mm-hmm.  What if, instead of going home,  we sneak into the hotel to see Tina ask her question  to the lady astronaut?  Oh. Not as good as I thought it was gonna be.  Linda, that's a really bad idea.  We should probably give Tina some breathing room right now.  I'm losing her, Bob.  I need to get into that conference.  But you're not allowed back in the hotel.  Well I could wear a disguise.  - A disguise? - I'm back on board.  See? That's why you're gonna marry this gal.  You really want to do this?  I need to do this.  Okay, red flags all over the place,  but let's go get you a disguise.  Let's see, we've got sunglasses,  but that's a little boring. How about a bandanna?  They come in camouflage or pink camouflage.  - Pink camouflage. - Mother, good choice.  Great choice. May I make a suggestion?  This T-shirt makes it look like you're wearing a bikini.  That's pretty good.  - It's perfect. - We'll take two.  How do I look?  Like someone who swallows cigarettes  for free drinks at bars.  BOB: All right. It says Bernadette Baker goes on in 15 minutes.  An astronaut and a karate expert?  Pick a lane.  (gasps)  LINDA: That's her.  What?  Uh, I got to pee.  Uh, you guys find seats, and I'll be right back.  Huh.  - (clears throat) - Oh, Louise.  What are you up to, Mom?  (laughs nervously): What? Nothing.  Okay, fine, I'll tell you, but don't tell your father.  I can't get through to Tina, but you know what can?  Some strong heroine.  Now you go to the seats and cover for me.  Mama's going backstage.  - Wait, wait, Mom. - What?  Price tag. You would have looked ridiculous.  Uh-oh.  Bernadette Baker's keynote is in ten minutes.  Tina, since you're asking a question  you should sit by the aisle.  Okay. Uh, can I sit with my friend Dillon?  She's from another school.  She's from another school.  Yeah, we get it. You made a friend.  FROND: Yeah, Tina, we get it.  (gasps) Good morning.  (in deep voice): Hey.  How are you enjoying your stay?  Oh, fine, fine. Great fountain.  Thank you.  Zero gravity. Zero fear.  Bernadette,  you are cleared for takeoff.  - Excuse me. - (shouts)  (grunting)  (muffled): Are you Bernadette Baker?  Ooh, sorry, you're just a lady.  I thought you were my sensei testing me.  He wears that bandanna as well.  - Where's your mom? - You know Mom.  She loves her hotel bathrooms.  And they fear her.  I still can't believe your mom.  Those were some crazy, smother-mother moves last night.  Yeah. As Bernadette would say, ""Give me some space.""  Ugh, my mom's trying to invade my eye space.  - Uh? - Uh-uh.  - Uh? Uh? - No, not happening.  So, that's not a bikini?  No. I'm in a disguise.  - Okay. - My real identity?  Well, let's just say I'm a mother with a daughter.  - You're a mother, right? - I am not a mother.  I thought it said you were a mother in your book.  It did not say that.  I did not read it.  I think I-I have to go on now.  - Wait, wait. Listen, Bernadette. - Mm?  At the end of your speech, my daughter is gonna ask  who inspired you to go to space,  and I need you to say, ""My mother.""  I'm sorry, you want me to do what?  My daughter doesn't understand the importance  of a mommy-daughter relationship.  She thinks I'm embarrassing.  (sarcastically): That's crazy.  Why would she think that?  I know. Listen, you can set her straight.  Ms. Baker? They're ready for you.  I have to go now,  and I want to go.  - Hey, look at me. - Hmm?  - I like you, too. - Sure.  It's my pleasure to introduce  this year's Heroine Conference keynote speaker,  a woman who is truly out of this world,  Bernadette Baker.  - (scattered applause) - Uh, thank you.  Thank you so much for being here today.  And thank you to myself, which is also important.  So, in conclusion,  outer space, determination and karate.  Thank you. Thank you.  (shouts)  Wow, I am inspired.  - Are you inspired? - Are you crying?  - Absolutely, yeah. - Time for the Q&A.  If your question was picked,  please line up behind one of the microphones.  Okay. Here it comes.  - What? - Nothing, nothing.  Okay.  If you were going to space again  and you could only bring one CD, what would it be?  Dave Matthews Band, Live At Red Rocks. Great question.  No one's from Mars, no one's from Venus, end of discussion.  The crotch, the throat and the eyes, in that order.  Practice at home.  Next question. Go ahead.  Hi. I'm Tina. I'm 13 years old.  And I'd like to know, who inspired you to go to space?  - Oh. Hmm. - Come on, astronaut lady.  Lin, shh.  - You shush. - Sorry.  The person who inspired me  to go to space was  Say it. Say it.   my seventh-grade chemistry teacher.  What?! No, no.  Linda, what are you doing?  Uh, yes, go ahead?  (grunting) Why do you go to space?  Everything's here.  This question again.  Okay, well, let me first say  (microphone feedback)  Uh, excuse me, Bernadette.  Um, back to that last girl's question:  are you sure you answered that one correctly?  Mom?!  Is there someone else who inspired you?  Someone in your family, maybe?  Um, I don't think that this is, uh, the time  Uh-huh, uh-huh, like, um, um,  what's it called when you're not the daddy but you're the ?  TINA: I have a follow-up to the follow-up.  What happens if your mom acts crazy and wears a disguise  to sneak into a thing, even though you told her  - she couldn't come? - Oh, God.  Um, um, what if the mom only did that because  her daughter has been blowing her off all weekend?  What if she wasn't blowing anyone off,  she just wanted to hang out with her new friend her own age?!  Huh, Bernadette?!  - Uh - LINDA: A mom can be a friend,  right, Bernadette?  TINA: Would a friend embarrass you,  and pour shampoo in a fountain, Bernadette?  Pouring shampoo in a fountain  is not embarrassing, it's really cool.  All right, I'm beginning to suspect that  that is Linda Belcher.  And you, Linda, are not welcome here.  Shush, Frond. I got one more question.  What if the mom only did that stuff 'cause she was afraid?  'Cause she thought her daughter was  turning into a different person,  someone who thinks it's weird to be close to her mom.  Okay, that's a damn good disguise, but the jig is up.  - Come with me. - TINA: Mom  I don't think it's weird to be close to you.  You did embarrass me last night,  and a lot right now, and I'm sure a lot more in the future,  but I'm lucky I have a mom I'm close to,  and I don't ever want that to change.  Aw. My teeny Tina.  - Excuse me. - Excuse me.  - Excuse me. - Excuse me.  - Sorry. Let me get through. - Pardon me. Sorry.  Was that meant for me? That was meant for me.  Too much, Mom. Too much.  (grunts) Can't stop now.  This was a horrible idea.  Excuse me. Come on. Time to go.  Okay, okay. I'm hugging my daughter.  Should I go with you, Mom?  No. Stay. Stay. Have fun with Dillon.  Okay. Thanks. But could you,  um, let go of my wrist.  Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry. Yeah.  Sorry, Bernadette.  I-I guess I got to leave,  but I just wanted to say thank you.  It was a great story, and you're a real inspiration.  Best bachelor party ever!  I-I-It's my bachelor party.  Bob, we got to go!  Uh, that-that's my wi I, uh fiancÃ©e.  GENE: Let's get these two crazy kids to the altar!  Dad-chelor party   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh   Dad-chelor party   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh   He's a dad   Dad-chelor   It's a dad-chelor party   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  Dad-chelor   He's a dad   Dad-chelor party   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh."
"1    LOUISE: Tina, wrap it up, huh?  You've been at the touch tank forever.  But I haven't even touched the sea cucumber.  He's playing hard to get.  Have you done the penny crusher yet?  Yeah, but I didn't have a penny,  so I crushed our house key.  So, yeah, I think we've done all there is to do here.  Oh, hi, Judy. Feeding time, huh?  No. Just doing a detail job on the urchin's anus.  Good work if you can get it.  Sure is, but it looks like  I won't be able to do it much longer.  Why? Did the sea urchin learn how to brush its own anus?  No. The aquarium is shutting down.  - Wait, what? - Huh?  - Makes sense. - The aquarium is shutting down?  - I know. - But why?  Well, it's never been much of a moneymaker,  and this year I can't even pay my taxes.  But the aquarium can't close. We love this place. Right?  I mean, right?  Eh, we're not as touchy-fishy as you are.  Nobody is.  Question: have you considered making more money?  I have. That's why I expanded the key chain section  to include my handmade jewelry.  They make great gifts.  Well, I mean, they make gifts.  You just need more people in here.  We could try to rustle up some customers for you.  We do it all the time for our family's restaurant.  Hey, guy walking by,  do you love aquariums? Sure you do.  I can tell by the way you're avoiding eye contact with me.  You, lady with the stroller.  Want to take a break and sit down for the low, low price  of four dollars for adults, two dollars for kids under 12?  No? Okay.  Then it's your fault this place is closing. Monsters.  And we cleared the entire block.  (laughs) Okay, have a good one.  Wait, they tipped you eight dollars?  - Yup. - Geez. That's a huge tip.  I-I don't get tips like that.  Of course not.  Wait, why ""of course not""?  Oh, nothing. Never mind.  No. What do you mean, Lin?  Sometimes you can come off a little surly.  - What? I'm not surly. - Eh.  May I suggest gruff?  Well, you're not conventionally charming, you know?  And-And charming's what gets tips.  Uh, I think you're charming, Bob.  Thank you, Teddy.  - That one time. - Mm.  I'm just saying if you wanted some help  with your customer relations, I could give you some pointers.  Uh, I can turn on the charm if I want to, Lin.  I can get tips. Big tips.  Why don't you, uh, show us what you got?  Okay. I will.  All right.  BOB: So, how's everyone doing this afternoon,  this late afternoon?  Great, thanks.  So, uh, the, uh, the food is good?  Yes, it is good.  Has anyone seen the weather outside today?  I-I hear it was it was windy earlier  and then not so windy now.  Uh-huh.  Are you okay?  Yeah. I was just leaning casually on the  I don't know where to lean.  I'm gonna go let you eat. I'm gonna leave now.  Oh, my God, that was horrible.  (whispering): Terrible.  You made everyone so uncomfortable.  - (whispering): Everyone. - All right, I get it.  Ah, you just need a little tune-up, is all.  Luckily, I'm an expert, so you're in good hands.  Do not ask us to work because we've been hustling  our little tushes off all morning.  Oh, yeah? Where you been?  At the aquarium. It's shutting down.  You mean the key chain store?  It's an aquarium.  Oh, the little one by the ferry?  Man, I haven't been there in forever.  No one has. That's why they can't pay their taxes.  Wait, aren't aquariums nonprofits?  It's really a key chain store with fish.  And you're a body odor store with burgers.  - Tina! - Sorry. Sorry, Dad.  It's too bad they're not a church or a place of worship.  Then they'd be tax-exempt.  Wait, churches don't pay taxes?  Churches don't pay taxes, but they're hard to heat,  so it balances out.  Interesting. Right, Tina?  I mean, I guess.  I never thought about heating costs for churches, but sure.  High ceilings, all those windows  (whistles)  Not the heating part. The other part.  - Cooling costs? - Ugh. Just come with me.  LOUISE: And they walk you through it.  In 12 to 25 easy steps,  you could become a tax-exempt place of worship.  The church of Aquaticism.  Ah.   Make up a religion? I don't know.  Hey, look, I'm not much of a lyin' Brian myself,  but if it means keeping this place open, then we'll do  what we got to do and take it to our graves, right?  So, Judy, are you in?  Everybody lies on the Internet. It is not a big deal.  I figured that out the hard way.  Just because a man's e-mail address has Tony Danza in it  does not mean he's Tony Danza.  So?  (sighs) All right.  - Let's do it. - Yeah. Who's the Boss now?  Wait, what are we doing?  Oh, making up a religion to get out of paying taxes  this is giving me queasy knees.  Yeah, that's how you know you're doing the right thing.  - Keep going. - Okay, last question.  ""Please provide a brief history of the church.""  - I don't know. - All right, all right.  Aquaticism has been making waves and touching lives  for over 30 years.  It's been a beacon of light for lost souls ever since  our founders first put fingers to fish.  Judy, type faster, huh?  ""First put fingers to fish"" and?  And felt a wave of fulfillment  and connection and peace  and a place to go after school.  Judy, could you type a little faster?  Okay, okay. Oh, boy.  And submit.  Sort of surprised you didn't want to read over it again,  but bing, Bam, boom.  Congratulations, everyone.  So is this place a church now?  Did we save the aquarium?  I think we did.  - (computer chimes) - What do we got here?  Aquaticism All right.  MAN: What? Nothing.  That was easy. What should we do next?  Manipulate the stock market?  - (computer beeps) - What's this?  ""Thank you for your application.  ""An agent will be in contact  with you to arrange an inspection""?  - Well played, IRS. - Oh, my God!  Judy, it's a curve ball, sure, but we can do this.  What if we can't?  We could get in serious trouble.  - Who's ""we,"" grown-up? - What?  Don't listen to him, even though he's right.  Look at me. Technically, you only  have to pass for a church for what? Like, ten minutes?  You can do that, can't you?  Um Just got to  give this aquarium a church-over.  Plus a believable Bible and a brief  but compelling religious service.  Judy, you got this, right? We're gonna skedaddle.  - Wha ? - No, no, no, no.  Gene and Louise and I will help.  We'll help every step of the way.  And when there's only one set of footprints,  it means we stopped helping.  Bob, watch this; watch what I do.  Charm school's in session.  I call this the ""Tiny Tap with a Hon"".  - How's the burger, hon? - Great.  All right, hon.  Three-dollar tip minimum, I guarantee it.  Okay. So you touch customers.  Yeah. And I say ""hon.""  But it's different if I do it than if you do it.  What? That's sexist.  Try it. Try it on me.  Okay.  Ew. What was that?  What? I just touched your shoulder.  It's like you put a wet lizard on me.  Do it again; do it better.  - Say and say ""hon."" - Okay.  - Hon. - Ugh.  - What? - You know what?  Don't touch anybody.  Okay. Did I say the ""hon"" right? Or  - No. - All right, fine.  I'm gonna go wipe something down.  Ew. With your wet hands.  Kids, wh-what are you doing over there?  - Making a religion. - What?  - Doing homework. - Oh.  - TINA: Fake religion homework. - Wha-- Wait, what?  Nothing.  I got to say, this place looks  pretty much like an aquarium  with a couple of religious signs slapped up.  (laughs)  But it's not, right?  What? No. I mean, it was,  but it-it's not; it's a church.  I mean, we're trying to get it registered as a church.  - Flanley? Is that your name? - Yes.  - Is that Mexican? - No.  Huh. Would you like to meet our youth group?  Uh, oh, okay.  - This is the Aquaticism Youth Group. - The Groupers.  They should talk. Now.  Yeah, we're the Groupers.  Our youth group is very active in the church.  You know, it's a wonderful church.  So wonderful.  And such a church.  Go ahead, Agent Flanley, you can ask me anything  in front of the youth group.  Oh, um  I need to see some Aquaticism literature.  Oh, we just finished the literature.  - I mean, reading it. - It's so good.  Eh, it's a little preachy.  - Uh Yep. Ye-- Yep. - See it?  So you saw that. Well, I got a glimpse of it.  Did you see the drawings?  Ooh-la-la.  And that formatting.  - Well, that's about it. - Oh, great.  For the easy questions.  - Onto the tough stuff. - Oh, great.  Okay, yesterday, in charm school, you were horrible.  - I-I wasn't that bad. - You were,  but fortunately for you, I had an idea.  We go with ""fun teasing guy.""  No touching, just fun teasing.  I-I can do that.  I mean, I think I already do that,  but tell me what you think I should do.  First of all, when you're talking to the customers,  you give 'em the business.  A smidge of the business, like this.  Watch this, watch me.  - Hey, Teddy, slow down. - (grunts)  Your stomach called.  It said your mouth needs to chew your food.  (laughs, chokes)  (laughing): My stomach called.  Ah. That's a good one, Lin. Eh.  Wow, it worked on Teddy.  Bob. Charm school.  - Do it. Go do it. - Uh, okay.  - Hey, h-how's everybody doing? - Pretty good.  - We're celebrating Marty's birthday. - Mm-hmm.  - He wanted a burger. - Mm-hmm.  (chuckling): Well, by the looks of Marty,  it, uh it may be his-his last one.  (chuckling): Right?  What, do you think that's funny?  What? No. I'm gonna die soon?  No. I'm-I'm just giving you the business, sir.  Just a smidge.  Send over the girl that touches you.  - Get outta here. - Okay. Lin!  JUDY: So, when you say  ""does your church have  a distinct ecclesiastical government,""  you mean, do we  We do, of course, have all those things.  So much. Almost too much.  Hey, have we shown you the touch tank yet?  Okay, we can come back to that question.  And a bunch of the other ones.  Let me tell you about this touch tank.  You could come in here no matter what kind of day you had,  no matter what Tammy told Jocelyn you did in P.E.,  that you really did but hoped no one saw--  not nose-picking, just a quick pick--  you can put your hands in the tank  for a little while, and it's like you're a starfish in a tide pool.  And nothing bothers a starfish in a tide pool  except me touching it.  You should give it a whirl.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't, I don't think so, no.  You might like it, Agent Flanley.  Yeah, get in there.  (laughs) All right, all right, for a second.  - Oh, that is brisk. - Pick up a cucumber.  Oh, oh. Ooh.  Sorry about that. Sorry.  - I touched your sea cucumber. - Oh.  Wow! Are they, uh, are they supposed to be this ugly?  (laughing): Or, or is it sick?  Who's to say?  It's true that they're not very attractive,  and they move very slowly.  But you know why sea cucumbers are great?  Uh, no, I don't, I don't know why.  Because they eat the stuff that no one else in the ocean wants.  And what they poop out is cleaner than what they take in.  So basically, these ugly- slash-beautiful creatures  just go along, constantly making things better  than when they found it.  I think we could all learn from the sea cucumber.  Let me tell you something.  You would not believe the crap  that people try to pass off as religions.  (laughing): Yeah.  I mean, how gullible does everyone think I am?  But this religion,  what you've got here  - is special. - It is?  It is.  It's beautiful and thoughtful.  It's answering questions I didn't even know I had.  Totally, bro.  All right, well, here you go.  These are all the tax documents you need  as an official place of worship.  - You're all set. - Really?  You remember where you parked?  Uh, do you need help to your car?  Judy, do you validate?  Only spiritually.  - (laughing) - Okay.  Well, this is good-bye,  - I guess. - Good-bye.  Yes You know, I  - (gasping) - I can't shake the feeling  that I somehow belong here.  - Okay, then. E-mail us anytime. - Oh, look at this.  Your church has some neat activities lined up.  Singles mixer tomorrow.  That sounds fun.  Oh. Is that tomorrow?  Actually, I think that schedule's wrong, Judy.  All the singles (sputters)  died and then, um  You know, if it's okay with you, I-I'd love to dip my toes  into Aquaticism, so to speak,  and maybe come back tomorrow, off the clock.  Not as Agent Flanley, just as Roger.  It's not my name; it's just what I would come back as.  I'm kidding. Not about coming back.  I'm coming back. But about my name.  My name is Roger.  So many jokes all of a sudden.  Yeah, well, I guess I'm nervous.  - (nervously): I'm not! - Can I interject?  We will see you tomorrow, Roger. If that's your name.  I had trouble following your very funny joke.  Great! Okay, well, I can't wait to meet more of the congregation  at the singles mixer. Bye! I'll see you tomorrow night!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Crap.  We don't have a congregation.  Right. Crap.  (singsongy): But we're all single!  Guys, lying about having a fake church is probably immoral.  And lying to the IRS is definitely illegal.  Singles mixers are not illegal,  but if they're good, they are immoral, am I right?  Dad, come on. We're saving a small-time aquarium.  And saving souls. Maybe. You don't know.  It sounds like a really, really bad idea.  - I'm in! - Wait, what?  Bless you, Mother.  Eh, it sounds fun.  Singles mixer for a good cause.  Let's go. Why not?  Uh, because it's fraud?  - Right? Anybody? - What?  Don't you want to say you saved an aquarium?  You owe it to the fish. With all those poops you've flushed  - into the ocean. - That's not how flushing works,  but, fine, I'll go.  Mort, Teddy, what do you say?  Are you kidding? I was born single.  I was gonna pick up my mom at the airport tomorrow night,  but she can take a cab.  She's not that blind. I mean, she can still see shapes.  And, remember, you're all devout Aquaticists.  Did I hear something about a singles mixer?  Because I'm seeing someone right now,  but I'm always stacking backups!    Pretty convincing mixer, huh?  It's awkward and sad.  That feels right. We might be good here.  C-Can I ask you something?  Where did you find this amazing jewelry?  It's like fish but jewelry.  - I love it. - You love the jewelry?  - Yeah. - Nobody loves the jewelry.  You know, I make it myself.  You made all these? Did you go to jewelry school or something?  No. Did you go to IRS school?  - You wish. (laughs) - (chuckles)  - You wish. - You know what, now I'm worried.  This might be going too well.  That guy is having way too much fun.  - Isn't that good? - No. He's never going to leave.  He's gonna want to come back week after week  to services that don't exist.  How long do we have to keep coming to this place?  Are we gonna have to raise our children in this church?  - Ah! - Guys, we got to make him  reconsider a life of Aquaticism.  Hello, all. Agent Flanley, you are really starting  to get into this religion, aren't you?  You know, I'm n I'm not gonna lie, I'm I-I am feeling it.  Yeah. Okay. Just so you know,  Aquaticism isn't for everyone.  Because our baptism ceremony is,  well, let's just say, challenging.  Challenging? How so?  To join Aquaticism, you have to  submerge yourself in the jellyfish tank.  - Oh, God, you do? - Yeah. D Judy.  Don't don't No, I mean you Oh, boy, do you.  Yeah. don't jellyfish sting?  Oh, you better believe it.  - They sting and sting and sting - Ow.  - and sting and sting and sting! - Ah. Ah. Ow, ow, ow.  It's awful!  It's like circumcision for your whole body,  except your penis.  But it's the only way to show you're truly dedicated.  And also you can't eat ice cream, you can't go  to the movies, and you have to sleep in your jeans.  So, yeah, that's Aquaticism for ya. Have fun at the mixer!  (quietly): That should do it.  (sipping) Hello. I'm Bob.  Hello. I'm Linda.  I noticed you sauntering over here.  Yeah, I noticed you drinking over here.  Uh, a lot.  Seems like a single fella like you is using his charm on me.  - Is that what I'm seeing? - I might be making  a charm-esan sandwich, yeah.  I love sandwiches.  Yeah, well, you smell like you do.  Thank you. You smell, uh, interesting.  You got a toothbrush at home or you still shopping around?  How 'bout I, uh, use yours?  I have to say Bob, was it?  My charm alarm is ringing off the hook.  Should I let it go to voice mail and we keep talking?  So, wait, it's an alarm that has voice mail?  I don't get it.  Hello, single people at this mixer  who I've never met before,  or if we have met, it was casually at services.  - I'm Teddy. - Hi, Teddy. I'm Bob.  Looking good. I mean, it's rather tight.  It's from prom. Not my prom.  So, who wants a drink? You? You? You?  - I'll have one! - All right. How 'bout you, Bob?  You want a drink? You look like you could use one.  Why don't you loosen up? It's a mixer,  (stammers) I don't  - you know what I mean? - Teddy, calm down.  - What? - It's fine, Bob. It's fun.  - It's not fun. - No, it's fun! He's  Well, he hit me on the shoulder, so I didn't like that.  I'm gonna go look at some fish.  Oh, my God! I love this song!  Hey, who wants to touch the crabs in my touch tank?  (laughs)  Linda, look at this! It's called a Tuscaloosa Twister!  (laughs) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ooh!  - So violent and uncomfortable-looking! - Yep!  - May I cut in? - You get the hell out of here, Mort!  Dancing away!  I-Is it always like this at the church,  so fun, so positive?  It sure is, probably!  Well, then I am ready.  You're taking off your shoes. That's fun.  - 'Kay. - Oh, you're taking off your shirt.  - Yeah. - I'm sure there's a reason for that.  There we go. (grunts)  Okay, I have a question.  Why did you take off all your clothes?  Because I am ready to face my fears.  I am ready to join Aquaticism!  Oh.  I am ready to get into that jellyfish tank!  Yeah! Let's all get tanked!  No, that's a bad idea. They'll sting you.  No, I know, I know.  I want them to. I mean, I don't.  But I want to experience it.  I want to join the church.  Aw, that's beautiful, but, you know what,  I-I don't think it's, um  (clears throat) stinging season.  I don't know if I'll have the nerve another time.  It's-it's got to be now!  Okay, so do I go into shock? Is there a medic on hand?  Uh, there's a mortician.  - Hello! - I'm not sure what's happening.  - Okay. Here we go. One! Two! - (protesting)  Aquaticism!  (shouting, gasping)  It's fake! It's fake! It's all fake!  It's not a real religion! We lied to get out of paying taxes!  Hey, they're not stinging me.  Wait, did you just say it's all fake?  No. Come on out. Your skin's gonna get all pruny.  No, seriously. Did you just say Aquaticism is a fake religion?  Can you please just get out?!  We can talk about this outside the jellyfish tank!  Don't try to change the subject, Judy!  IRS guy! Get out of the tank!  So is this whole place fake?!  Are the jellyfish fake, too?  I guess they are, because I'm not even getting Stu  Oh! Oh! Oh, God! Oh!  (screaming continues) (groaning)    MAN: Agent Flanley, there are some children here for you.  Did you order three children?  Hmm. No, I didn't. But send them down.  (whistles) Must be nice.  So, you guys are here because ?  We heard you're not gonna prosecute Judy for tax fraud.  Which is very generous. I mean, the aquarium is still closing  'cause business stinks, but better than going to jail. Yay.  So we came to give you this ""We're sorry"" card.  We didn't mean for you to get hurt.  We just wanted you to believe the church was real.  And then you joined it. And then we didn't know what to do.  Man, we must have done quite a job to make a smart guy like you  believe in our fishy shtick.  Well, in retrospect, there were red flags.  Really, everything was a red flag.  - Even our red flags? - Yeah.  I guess I was just blinded by Judy.  I mean, she's just really great.  Wait, you had a crush on Judy?  I did. I thought I was into Aquaticism,  but I guess I was into Judy.  You should call her! Go to her.  Nah. She doesn't want to see me.  Plus, I'm very busy.  Excuse me while I apply my medicated lotion.  Roger, could you not do that? It's just the smell. I'm sorry.  Right, right. I guess I'll just itch and be in pain.  - Thank you. - Okay. We about done here, kids?  No, wait, Roger, don't give up on Judy.  We may have made a mess of a fake religion,  but you two sea cucumbers took it in.  And maybe pooped out love.  Or at least a date. Possibly?  No. As we say in the IRS,  that case is closed.  Thanks for coming!  Yes! A ten-dollar tip! Look at this.  Linda, look at this ten-dollar bill.  Well, how about that, huh?  You're like a runaway charm train.  Ooh, excuse me. Hello. And welcome.  - Right this way. - Wow. Look at Bob, huh?  - Getting the big tips. - Kinda.  (quietly): That last table left him two bucks,  and I swapped it out for a ten.  The poor schmuck needed a win.  Especially now that we're dating, right?  (chuckles) Just kidding, just kidding. Right?  So, Judy, you think you might want to give Roger a chance?  Oh, I'm sure he was just being nice.  He doesn't want to go out with a tax cheat like me.  We're just gonna take a little trip to the beach. That's all.  - Hi, Judy. - Roger?  I thought I smelled that lotion.  Y-You know, I-I didn't get a chance to say some things  the last time we saw each other.  Yeah, those paramedics were in such a rush.  I had a thought. That's why I came over.  You could keep this place in business  by renting it out for parties.  Like the Aquaticism party.  But with less tax fraud.  - You think that would work? - Yeah, it's a thought.  Might help your bottom line. That's accounting talk.  A-Also, kind of unrelated,  would you ever want to get a cup of coffee with me, maybe?  I mean, we could each get our own coffee, not just  one cup, where we're both trying  to drink out of it at the same time  Okay. Let's do it! The two-cup thing.  - Or the one. Either one. I'm open. - Great!  I mean, we could do the two now and then  Is this going well? I can't tell.  This is going really well.  I got to say, Tina, I didn't get what you saw in this place.  But I-I kind-kinda get it now.  Mm-hmm.  You guys want to stay for a little while  and kinda jellyfish out?  I call that one. Oh, wait, that one's dead.  I'm gonna look at this one. Gene, you want  - to look at that one? - On it!  TEDDY:  Tusca, Tuscaloosa Twister   Tusca, Tuscaloosa Twister   Tusca, Tuscaloosa Twister   Tusca, Tusca   Hey, hey, hey! Linda, look at this!  Whoa! Whoa!  Cha-cha-cha   Wow! Whoa!  Cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha-cha   Tusca, Tusca   Tusca, Tuscaloosa Twister   Tusca, Tuscaloosa Twister   Tusca, Tuscaloosa Twister   Tusca, Tusca."
"1    This Joe is barely sloppied. Waiter!  Guys, don't look now, but Henry Haber and Todd  are walking this way and they're wearing suit jackets.  - Narcs! - Oh, hi, Todd, hi, Henry.  So, small talk.  Uh, what about it?  Just getting it out of the way.  Tina, how'd you like to join the debate team?  Debate? Why me?  We have to have at least one girl  and our last one quit to focus on spelling bee.  O-U-C-H.  Anyway, uh, we need another girl  and thought of you almost immediately.  Well, I'm flattered. But I'm pretty slammed with social commitments.  I'm on-again off-again with Jimmy Jr.,  and I think I'm about to hit a sweet patch of on-again.  Where is he, anyway? He was maybe gonna sit here.  Tamica, look, I can kiss my elbow.  - (groaning) - Cool.  And you're off again.  Ugh, so now we're elbow kissing everyone?  Okay, looks like my schedule might be wide open, actually.  I don't have to talk in debate, right?  - I have a fear of public speaking. - Oh, boy.  -  - MR. DeSANTO: Welcome to  - our newest debater, Tina. - Thanks, Mr. DeSanto.  You know most of these jokers.  Larry's our policy ace, Zach's a research machine,  and Todd's a ninja with sarcasm.  Sarcasm, huh. Any good?  (sarcastic): No, I'm terrible.  - Oh, that's too bad. - Ugh, I was doing it!  All right, tomorrow's debate topic is:  ""Should the U.S. switch to the metric system?""  Oh, fun, I love the metric system.  I give it a ten out of ten.  (chuckling) Get it? Everything's ten?  Uh, tough luck, kiddo.  We've been assigned the negative, against it.  But shouldn't we argue for what we really believe?  - (boys laugh) - Guys, guys.  Tina, pretending to strongly believe in something  that you don't is great preparation for being, like,  a lawyer, or a stepdad.  I guess I might be one of those some day.  You just have to stuff down your feelings  and stop believing in anything.  I think I can do that.  I mean, I don't think I can,  but I'm pretending I can.  Now you're getting it!  Aw, my talky Tina joined the debate team?  - You gonna miss her? - Yes.  It throws off our whole after-school play routine.  Usually we just do the opposite of what Tina wants to do and it's fun.  This is gonna sound crazy, but you guys could  get started on your homework.  (laughing): Yeah that does sound crazy, Dad.  - BOB: Mm. - It's not due till tomorrow, buddy.  Plus I don't even know where my backpack is.  - Whoa. Gene! - Oh, whoopsie.  GENE: Yes I see it, Dad, thanks.  Oh, my God, now we have to throw out ten pounds of hamburger meat.  Um, can we have it?  Why would you want that?  I don't know, I just I want it.  - I don't think that's a - Please?  We won't ask for any meat for Christmas this year.  Let 'em have the meat, Bob.  - Let 'em play with it. - Fine.  Y-You know you have to wash your hands  after you play with it, right?  I mean, technically meat's not a toy.  I'm gonna bring it in the tub.  Everything's a toy in there.  MR. DeSANTO: Tina, how you doing on that list of tongue twisters?  Getting your speed up? Your articulation?  I'm still stuck on the first one.  ""Ten tongue twisters.""  That one's not actually a you know what?  I'm gonna hand you over to our top debater, Henry.  (sighs) Fine.  So we're both excited, that's great.  Now we need to find some passion in your delivery.  What really gets you going?  You mean what makes me tick?  What makes you tick-tick-tick explode?  Think of things that get you mad.  I think of when they canceled Firefly. You try.  (sighs) I guess it makes me mad  that they call it your bottom when it's in the middle.  - Okay. - Or why do horseshoes  only come in one style?  Why can't they have horse sandals?  Find your Firefly, come on.  I got a Canadian quarter in change.  It's worthless unless I take a special trip  to Canada to buy gum. (groans)  You'll get there.  Look, a meat-eor.  - Eh, I guess it's just a meatball. - That's great.  But what do you think about this?  - Hubba hubba. - We need a picture.  - Gene, go get Mom's phone. - On it!  Got it! All you have to do  is ask Mom a math question and she says,  ""Here, there's a calculator on the phone.  - Don't make me do math!"" - Great.  - (camera shutter sound) - Give me sassy.  Now give me classy.  Now gassy.  Wait a minute. (chuckles)  - Gene, stop-motion! - Okay, now what?  No, if we move him a little  and take another picture, and keep doing it,  we can make a movie. Meat-mation!  Oh, my God, this is the most exciting thing we've ever done!  Okay. Reposition very slightly,  another click, reposition  And now I'm bored.  And if we adopt the metric system,  when someone says ""Thanks a ton,""  you won't actually know how much they're thanking you.  Oh, my God, she's a dud.  She's a dud, she is a dud.  (whispers): Find your Firefly.  I mean  (slow motion): Tamica, look,  I can kiss my elbow.  (groans) T-The metric system is dumb!  We already have grams, they're called ""grandmas""  and mine lives in Florida, thank you.  And if she has to learn kilometers she's gonna get lost  and never make it back to the condo.  This is America, damn it, and we're the leader  of the free world, not the liter.  - U-S-A! U-S-A! - (bell dings)  Whoa.  Counterpoint wow.  She's amazing.  And then you brought up foot-long hot dogs, which was great.  And then you pointed out that inchworms were cute,  but centipedes were gross.  - And then you're so beautiful. - Um, what?  Uh, it's-- debate exercise.  Proposition, uh, we should go on a date.  You take pro, I'll take con. Go.  But dating isn't debatable. Everything's debatable.  Okay, um, we should go on a date because  Pro: we both live on land.  Con: people find me annoying.  Pro: oh, we're not related to each other.  Con: I get really, uh, bad haircuts.  Pro: You don't have a rat tail; that's my deal-breaker.  Con: I have a rare kind of contagious acne.  Um, um, um, um, pro:  bears are less likely to attack two people than one.  Okay, I give up, I concede, you win.  We should go on a date.  Damn, I even convinced myself.  I'm that good.  Then it's settled. Shake.  Sundown is at 6:43, so my telescope and I will be there  at 6:44.  Only Ursa Minor will be visible,  but we'll still have Ursa major fun.  Got it, you'll show up or not show up.  I've been on dates before, I know how they work.  No, Tina, I'll be there.  In fact, let me give you an emergency contact number  because if I don't show up,, you can assume I'm dead.  Wow, I've never had this for sure of a date.  See you tonight. Unless I see you first.  Wait, uh, never mind, that doesn't    Well? Entertained?  It's the best movie of meat dancing  and then its head falling off that I've ever seen.  Since Magic Mike.  That's what you kids have been doing for two days?  We had a technical delay while we figured out  how to delete all the photos off your phone.  What?  It was just a bunch of pictures of your kids.  But this is just the sizzle reel for the movie we want to make,  - with a proper budget of $50 to $60. - No.  We've broken it out.  It's all gotta-haves, and no-wanna-haves.  Every dollar ends up on that screen.  ""On set masseuse, preferably named Bruce""?  Gotta-have!  Let me tell you a little more about the hero, huh, Dad?  Really not necessary.  Meat Man's a survivor.  No, he's not fancy,  he's just a proud, independent, hamburger man.  Hmm. A hamburger man.  And when he talks, people listen.  Especially his kids.  His super hot kids.  Does this meat man have a name?  Yes, it's ""Meat Man.""  - I like that. - Yeah.  I don't know, I'm not seeing it.  Let's talk about the steamy girlfriend, Lorna.  Ooh, Lorna.  She's the brains. She's also the wild card.  Her singing voice shatters diamonds!  I love it, I love it, I love it!   - (doorbell rings) - Oh, the door.  I don't want to miss anything.  Stop talking to each other.  Bonjour, Mrs. Belcher,  I'm picking up Tina for a date.  That's nice, who's Tina going on a date with?  - Me. - Oh.  TINA: Hi, Henry. I'm almost ready. Come on up.  Going up and everything, huh?  Look at that.  Hello, Mr. Belcher.  How are sports?  (chuckles) Uh, they're-they're fine, I guess.  Excellent. Gene, Louise.  How are your studies?  Someone did his research.  Yep, he has my blessing.  So Henry seems to be here.  Uh, what's going on with that?  Henry's thoughtful and attentive.  Other than my total lack of attraction to him,  - he's perfect boyfriend material. - He is?  Well, I mean he's made out of the same material as a boyfriend.  Well, I guess you solved romance.  Yeah. Phew.  So that was fun, Henry.  I mean, sort of.  Sorry if I was a telescope hog.  No, you gave me a peek there near the end.  I got the idea.  - Stars, right? - Yeah, planets.  And here we are back at my door.  20 minutes after we left.  So at the end of dates  is when I hear kisses occur.  And we're at the end of the date,  therefore, we should probably  Uh, rebuttal,  we have to debate with these mouths.  Don't want to risk injury, right?  God, I love it when you're debatey.  LOUISE: Okay, genre-wise,  this is straight up action-adventure, Rom-com,  costume, drama, buddy movie.  Oh, I love those.  LOUISE: So in this shot, Meat Man and Lorna scream  through the Moscow streets avoiding rogue CIA agents  till they get to the one person he trusts, Poopov.  Uh, can anyone do a Russian accent?  - I can. - Vodka.  - Da, da. - All good, all good.  - Uh, I guess Dad. - Damn it!  (with accent): ""At last we meet, Meat Man.""  Is anyone else hearing Dracula?  - (normal voice): Um, Louise? - Yeah, hon? How can I help?  Do you really want that double meat in there?  You have ""meet Meat?""  Oh, wow, that's a good point.  Thanks. Maybe we change it to:  (with accent): ""At last we are face-to-face ""  Let's cut it since you don't want to say it.  They'll communicate with a look, let's go.  - A-A look? - Mm-hmm.  Nice going, hot shot, you lost your line.  Roll camera and action.  (wheels squeaking, clattering)  They exchange a look, and cut.  We're moving on to Cairo.   Are zoos humane?  Well, my anaconda don't want none.  Yeah! Oh, yeah!  Put boys and girls in separate classes?  Is this middle school or the Middle Ages?  (whispers): I'm dating her.  And that, my fellow Americans, is why we should eat dog.  - (dramatic news theme plays) -   Hey, it's Jocelyn.  I'm here with Mr. DeSanto, who coaches the debate team,  which I think is gymnastics?  That's right, Jocelyn.  This weekend we go against King's Head Island.  And if we win we'll be bringing home the first trophy  - for the Wagstaff trophy case. - You mean the turtle tank?  MR. DeSANTO: Well, it's supposed to be a trophy case.  But there are turtles in it.  Which is going to change!  We are gonna be bringing home the iron.  But where will the turtles live?  I don't f-- I don't know. I don't know.  Just don't make it about the turtles, Jocelyn.  Okay, guys, this is a debate team away match overnight.  - So bring your medication - Mm-hmm.  - your mouth guards, nasal strips - Yep. Nasal strips.   whatever you need to have a good night's sleep  - Mm-hmm. - for a strong debate.  Also, we have received our topic.  ""Should a robot be president?""  Classic. Logic or emotion.  The old head versus heart.  Hope you guys can prep for the debate  with all those smoochatunities on the overnight.  - (laughs) - Please. Kissing's overrated.  Why lock lips when you can lock grips, right?  Mm.  Here's a tape of King's Head against Bog Harbor.  They've got only one non-crappy debater,  - Sasha Whiteman. - TINA: Oh, I know Sasha.  He's tricky and preppy.  Treppy? Pricky?  He'll have to be tricky 'cause the rest are stiffs.  This guy gets stress hiccups.  This girl's braces lock up.  This Duncan guy is from New Zealand, and no one can understand him.  Rebuttal, yeah. Where I'm from we call it buttle rubbies.  Whoa. Uh, could-could we, uh, roll back to Duncan?  - DUNCAN: Buttle rubbies. - And roll back again.  - I don't get it. - Buttle rubbies.  And again.  - Buttle rubbies. - Uh, why are we doing this?  - Uh, and one more time. - Last time.  - Buttle rubbies. - And again.  - What? - Buttle rubbies.  - Can you zoom? - I can't zoom.  - Zoom and enhance. - Enhance doesn't exist.  - Uh, and freeze frame. - All right, Tina.  Come on, let's start debate prepping, girlfriend.  What?! Oh, right.  (chuckles) We're dating.  It all came rushing back.  I'm just prewired for long-necked boys  with thick accents and/or speech impediments.  She likes them not quite a man and hard to understand.  - It stinks. - I know, sweetie.  No, something actually smells bad.  (sniffs) Ugh. It's Meat Man.  He's not getting any younger under these lights.  Oh, boy. The meat is turning gray.  Makeup.  - Best I can do. - (sighs)  I can't break up with Henry right before the big debate.  It'll kill him and we'll lose,  which will kill him again.  Listen, you're in, you're out. 24 hours.  And then Monday let Henry down as gently as you can,  like I did with Hugo.  You sang a break-up song on his answering machine.  It was a rap, Bob.  Tina, honey, just keep your head in the game,  and don't even look at this Duncan boy.  Avoid. Avoid.  Got it. Avoid mixing with Duncan.  Okay, guys, mix it up.  What do you say we go over there and get in their faces?  You know, intimidate them in a polite way.  Great idea, Habes.  Really get in their faces, like an inch away.  I'm drinking wine. I'm off school property.  (laughs) Or-Or, rejoinder,  we keep our distance and ignore them.  That always chaps my hide.  Tina Belcher.  I heard that voice, and I knew it either  had to be Tina Belcher or the saddest bird in the world.  - Hi, Sasha. Hello. - Hi.  (whispering): Closer. Intimidate.  Uh Tina, you seem to have noticed Duncan,  our exchange student from somewhere.  - New Zealand. - Right.  It's so far away that Duncan  went through puberty on the plane.  It's true. I got pit scrubbies and other scrubbies,  a couple of chesties.  Oh, a new one. Want one?  Um, one of your chesties?  Yeah. They just twist off.  Want me to twist you off a chestie?  Yes? I-I mean no. No. No.  - Sasha, you want one? - Yeah, I'll take one.  No worries, here you go. That's my best one.  No worries. That's what you say when there aren't worries, right?  But-But when there are worries, what do you say, ""Worries""?  (laughs nervously) Duncan.  Uh, King's Head huddle.  Tina is super freaky for Duncan. I'm calling an audible.  Duncan, you'll be my number two tomorrow against Henry and Tina.  Brenda, you're benched.  - But - Brenda, shush.  - We're going with the debate candy. - I'm not a good debater.  Just be you. And if you can figure out a way  to take off your shirt during the debate, do it.  Just use my arms, right?  Fun mixer. I-I'm gonna go prep for the debate.  You know, I think Duncan's gonna body surf  right outside the hotel windows to clear his brain.  Oh, I'll go get my togs on then.  You probably call them swimmies.  I don't care. Bye.  DUNCAN: That wave was a dumper.  I almost lost my togs.  - You could nearly see my bum. - (nervous grunting)  - (phone rings) - Hello?  Tina, the sunset is gorgeous down here.  You need help toweling off, Dunc?  Is no one gonna help Duncan towel off? Really?  It's so simple. He's wet, make him dry.  I know what you're doing, Sasha.  You're not gonna get me down to the beach.  (phone rings)  SASHA: Just calling you back real quick  to let you know that Duncan  is being so self-deprecatingly charming right now.  He's the center of attention, but also a little bit alone.  No one gets him.  - There. - (alarm ringing)  Oh, no, someone pulled the fire alarm.  Everybody down to the beautiful beach.  Whoops. All better.  Whoops. All better.  Whoops. All better. Whoops.  Oh, my God. Meat man's a mess.  Yeah, I don't think the love scene's believable anymore.  Lorna wouldn't kiss that old meat.  Oh, it's a little late in the day  to start talking about things Lorna wouldn't do.  Look, I'll kick in another ten pounds of hamburger  for a new meat man.  You mean recast?  But he's been with us since the beginning.  He knows the part.  He's just a piece of meat.  ""Just a piece of meat""? Wow.  That's kind of rough, Linda.  Yeah, you should hear yourself.  Okay. Sorry. Sorry, Meat Man.  (in deep voice): That's okay.  False alarm, everybody can go back in.  Probably a prank, a super-cool prank.  I'm going in. I-I got to go find an extension cord  for my sleep apnea machine.  - Yeah, I'm gonna go in, too oh! - Oh!  SASHA: Oh, look at that. You guys bumped into each other.  I'm gonna go inside, bye.  Oh, hi. Didn't see you there.  A crab bit me on my clacker.  Um. That's nice.  Just taking in the view.  The lights look pretty on the water, huh?  Yeah. You know, in New Zealand,  we don't say, ""Turn off the light,""  we say, ""Turn on the dark.""  Son of a bitch.  Mwah.  Oh! I got to go.  Wait, wait, I got to check something.  Mwah.  Uh, yeah, I was right.  (nervous grunting)  - Uh, no worries.  - No. Worries.  HENRY: Did you do those tongue exercises last night?  What, no. It was just a little peck.  Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.  (chuckles) All limber.  LINDA: Oh, my God, now we got flies.  It's disgusting.  Shoo. Shoo.  Oh, I-I think I swallowed one.  (coughs) It's flying back up. (coughs)  Louise, we've got to wrap this up.  I know, I know. I've got a new ending, okay?  Instead of the last 15 sequences,  we just blow Meat Man up  with a bunch of firecrackers I got from Teddy.  Bang! Fade out, roll credits.  The whole time he's been looking for the bomb,  and it's in his butt!  That's crazy. The meat would go everywhere.  And Teddy, you shouldn't give my kids fireworks.  Bob, on the set I like to be the solution guy,  not the here's-why-we-can't guy.  But there is something kind of perfect about it.  - I say we do it. - And I say you don't.  Hugo?  - And Ron. - And Ron. Sorry, Ron.  When I arrived for a surprise health inspection,  I expected to find beaucoup violations,  but not you people about to explode  rotted meat all over the restaurant.  But we need an end for our movie.  Well, I could care movie?  Should a robot be president?  Tina Belcher of Wagstaff will give the First Negative.  (microphone whines)  (clears throat) No, we should not have a robot president be-kiss  I-I-I mean because it wouldn't be smooch, I mean smart.  In the words of President Abraham Duncan  I-I-I mean Duncan Lincoln.  I mean, damn it, I-I-I kissed Duncan last night.  - (audience gasps) - Oh, no, it can't be.  Oh, yeah. Right.  I'm sorry, Henry.  You're using our First Negative to tell me you kissed Duncan?  And to break up with you.  (in high-pitched voice): And to break up with me?  Oh. We're dead.  We are dead.  I guess you can debate what you don't believe,  but you can't date what you don't believe.  - Anyway, robot president, um - (bell dings)  Oh, out of time.  I like kissing, you know?  I'm always keen for a kiss.  Should I talk about the robot?  A robot prezzy could turn into a plane.  No need for Air Force One, then.  - He is Air Force One. - (bell dings)  You know how long it'll take me to find another girlfriend?  (crying)  HUGO: Okay, how about this?  Instead of blowing up, Meat Man just drives away,  and everyone knows that's the last they'll ever see of him.  That's a terrible ending.  It's how the movie Drive ended.  - Ron cried. - I did.  No, no, the only ending that makes any sense  is the explosion.  You-You die how you live.  Scarface, Easy Rider,  Butch and Sundance.  Curious George.  He was a little too curious.  Okay, fine, but you deep clean afterwards,  and I get grateful acknowledgment in the credits,  plus a swag bag.  We're doing it, we're doing it.  Explode that sweet meat.  Anybody else with a phone, get it out.  We want multiple angles.  Okay, Teddy, cue firecrackers.  Roger.  We do this shot once, people.  Roll camera!  Maybe a mistake.  I've got old meat inside my headphone jack.  Worth it!  Should a robot be president?  Head or heart? Logic or emotion?  Take a look at the Wagstaff team  to see what emotions get you. (shuddering)  Let's keep emotions where they belong,  in off-Broadway shows that my uncle finances.  Robots have no emotions; they'll keep us safe.  Should a robot be president?  Hell yes.  - Hell yes! - (bell dings)  I nailed it, we're gonna win.  Rejoinder, Tina Belcher, Wagstaff.  (whines)  Henry, I know I wasted valuable debate minutes  breaking up with you,  but you're still my debate partner,  and I think maybe we can win this thing.  Let's talk about so-called logic.  I started dating Henry because it seemed logical  to try a reliable, but not-remotely-my-type guy.  - (groans) - Sorry, Henry.  But it was the wrong decision.  I was using my head to do something  that it couldn't handle by itself.  The brain needs the heart and the heart needs the brain.  I want a president with both those things,  with feelings, and lips  and a butt and boobs if it's a woman.  - Humans for president. - (bell dings)  Oh, crap.  She's still amazing.  (mutters incoherently)  Winner, Wagstaff.  Oh, my God, we won!  That's us, right?  Aren't we the Waggies?  When do you go back to New Zealand?  I live here now. I've moved here.  - Well, you're not welcome. - Aw, that's not right.  - Sorry about everything, Henry. - It's okay.  You made some good points up there.  And I didn't even think I'd go on a date until grad school,  so I'm way ahead, according to Haber-metrics.  There's someone out there for you.  And that's not up for debate.  (sighs) Great summation.  LINDA: Watch out, Meat Man.  It might be a trap!  LOUISE: Don't worry, we'll meat again  - So you broke up with poor Henry, huh? - Yeah.  I guess you just can't talk yourself into love.  I can talk myself into anything.  I like salad now!  Here comes the boffo ending, Dad.  - (sniffles): It's beautiful. - Yeah.  Aw, Bob. You identify with Meat Man.  (sniffs) I just think it's a good movie, Lin.  Everybody does. It's the best movie.  Uh, Mom, you have old meat in your ear.  That's collectible. Save it.  (action music playing)  Meat Man   BOB: Does this meat man have a name?  LOUISE: Yes. It's Meat Man.  Meat Man   BOB: I like that.  GENE: ""Just a piece of meat""?  Meat Man   Wow.  LOUISE: Meat Man's a survivor.  No, he's not fancy.  He's just a proud, independent hamburger man.  And when he talks, people listen.  Meat Man!"
"1 (Theme)    (tires screeching)  (Bob whistling)  Wow, Bobby, nice whistling.  You're in a good mood.  Yeah. Because tomorrow's Easter,  which means all next week,  everybody who gave up red meat for Lent  will be coming in for a burger.  We call it the Beef Boom.  Beef Boom.  And the kids are home for spring break so they get to help.  - Making that Lent rent! - It's the dream.  This year, I gave up my cholesterol medication for Lent.  Teddy, y-you shouldn't do that.  It's okay, Doctor.  Just a few more days, I think I can make it.  How many eggs am I allowed to eat? Nine?  - None - teen?  Gene, you're only robbing yourself  of the fun of finding it later.  But what if I accidentally just peeled this one  and it's on course to intersect with this hot sauce  and then somehow careen into my mouth?  (eating noises)  Oh, no!  - Gene! - Eat one from the other bowl  so there's an even number for the egg hunt.  You got it, toots.  Oh, right. You and Bob  have your big egg hiding competition.  Yep. Last egg found wins.  This year we're doing 72 eggs.  I mean 70, 'cause you're eating another egg, right?  GENE: Don't make me do math!  It's a lot of work, but it's worth it  because we do it for the kids.  They love it! Plus, I always win.  Ha, except for the last three years.  You got lucky.  This year, you're going down, mister!  (whispering): Hey, uh, what if we just took all these eggs  right now and put them in the Dumpster  so we don't have to do the stupid egg hunt?  Come on, Louise, you know how much  they love it. It's their time to shine.  Last year we didn't find the last egg until 8:30 at night.  And they don't give us our candy baskets from the Easter Bunny  till it's over.  It's the perfect crime.  I'm just saying, why don't we just tell them we hate it?  It would break their hearts. I don't think we should do that.  Ugh, okay, fine, but feelings aren't Easter eggs,  - and I can't hide them forever. - Good one.  Oh! I just thought of a new hiding place.  Mm-hmm. Is it inside the paper towel roll?  No.  I hate you.  LINDA: Go to sleep, guys, or the Easter Bunny won't come.  And don't come out of your rooms, even if you have to pee.  Just pee in your beds.  GENE: Way ahead of you.  Look what I found on sale at Food World!  Jellybean schnapps.  Isn't it fun?  Theme drink.  Oh, God.  Oh, good.  This is amazing.  It's like all the flavors at once.  Right? It doesn't even taste like it has alcohol in it.  How much does it have?  100 proof?  - Is that even legal? - I think.  I-I mean the label's got a lot of misspelled words.  And it looks like it's just taped on.  (chuckles) Did you buy it at a store?  Or did you just get it from a guy?  I got it in the parking lot.  I don't think Food World sells in the parking lot.  Everything is in the store,  'cause that's where you have to check out.  You know, I thought that.  Mm-hmm. It'll be fine, it'll be fine.  Smell it! It smells good.  Well, actually, it smells bad. But it tastes good.  Exactly. Happy Easter.  Okay, same rules as always,  and mark your eggs down on the map  so we can make sure they all get found.  And whoever's egg is found last is the winner.  - Let's have a clean fight. - All right.  One more drink for motivation.  Okay, one more and then it's time to get serious.  Then we'll schnapps drinking.  You get it?  Stop? Schnapps. Stop.  - Drink. Okay. - No. Bob, you're babbling.  Huh. Yeah. Am I drunk alrea  (Bob groaning)  Oh, my God.  Oh. Ow.  Ow. I can feel my blinks.  They hurt so much.  Oh, I'm gonna barf.  I'm gonna barf. I'm gonna barf.  Wait. No, not yet. Oh, I'm too tired.  Lin, what happened last night?  Did we hide the eggs?  Oh, I don't know. I think so.  Oh, no, there's one in my hand.  Um, I'll just hide it here.  Under my pillow. Did you see?  Yeah, no. I can't oh  Hopefully I did a better job with the rest of them.  Okay, I'm gonna go barf now.  Here I go. Getting up.  No, oh, no, I'm sitting down. I'm sitting down.  I got to sit down. Oh, hi, kids!  Hey, are we doing this or what?  I need to get some jellybeans  in my face before midnight.  (groans) Please don't say ""jellybeans.""  - Jellybeans. - (gags) Gene.  What's wrong with you guys?  We were just up late.  You smell like candy and B.O. mixed together,  like a homeless M&M.  Don't take this the wrong way,  but you both look like Nicholas Cage right now.  Why don't you guys go wait in the living room?  I'm just gonna sit and,  um, groan for a second.  Hear ye, hear ye.  Shh. Too loud, too loud.  (quietly): Ye olde annual Belcher egg hunt  What? I can't hear you!  Shh! I can't hear you now!  Okay, okay, Louise.  Ye olde annual Belcher egg hunt is about to begin.  Remember to call out whose egg it is when you find one,  because one of those eggs will be the last.  And it will probably be mine.  And a-go.  (kids panting)  Get ready to lose, big talker.  You're the one that's gonna lose, Bob.  I hid my eggs great.  Actually, I don't know if I did.  Hey, do you remember where any of your eggs are?  Not really. Where's the map?  Uh, oh, right, right, right, map, the map.  Ooh, map is a no-go.  Did I write ""Linda is a fart"" on it?  Yeah. You did.  - (laughs) That's hilarious. - Eh. It's okay.  Uh, don't worry, I'm sure they'll find the eggs.  I-I'm just gonna go take some more aspirin.  How many can I take? Like, 20?  Yeah, that sounds right.  Oh, you know what? I'll take ten.  It's Mom's.  In the plunger. Sorry, Mom.  No, it's fun, it's fun.  Easter's fun.  - Come here, Gene. - Yeah?  Don't find another egg unless it's got a ""D"" on it.  Ha, ha.  Found one. It's Dad's.  Um, Tina, what if you just put it back?  Dad, that's cheating.  - I'll give you $500. - I heard that!  - It's Mom's. - Huh.  I feel like that was a hiding place of mine last year.  That's weird. It's almost like you remembered it  and then copied it because it was so good.  Don't you need to go start the ham?  Ugh. You look like a giant pink jellybean.  (high-pitched): Just glaze me and get it over with.  - Sorry, Mom. - Damn it!  We have 62 eggs.  And it's only 6:45 p.m.  Yeah. In the early evening.  Yeah. And we started at 7:00 a.m.  I remember that. It was so long ago.  I was young.  - My feet hurt. - Um, may I suggest that we  could have some hints?  No! Hints make it less fun.  Trust us, they don't.  Aw, they're loving it.  I am getting hungry, though.  Is the ham ready?  Oh, let me check.  I never turned the oven on.  I-I think I might have still been drunk earlier.  And now.  Should we order pizza?  Did you guys find the last egg yet?  No!  (Louise clamoring)  (spits)  Louise, you're getting flour everywhere.  (laughs)  This is it! I did it!  Number 70.  - Whose is it? - Is it mine?  It is a ""D.""  - No! - Yes!  I am the king!  The king of eggs!  All right, here are your candy baskets.  Yeah! (laughs)  Great hunt, everybody.  After you have a little candy, make sure  you get a good night's sleep for a Beef Boom.  Time to strap on the old feed basket.  I'm not even tasting it, mm.  Remind me again, is it okay to eat the Easter basket grass?  Ugh, what's that smell?  (sniffing)  Smells like a Gene special.  I'm flattered, but it wasn't me.  Let's round up the usual suspects:  Tina's breath, Tina's pits, Tina's shoes.  All good ideas.  (sniffs) No, I, I know that smell.  Me, too. (sniffs)  Oh, my God! It's an egg!  A rotten egg!  (gasping) Aah! Oh, no.  Did we not find one of the eggs?  Last one to find the rotten egg is a rotten egg.  That smell can't be an egg.  You kids dyed 72 in the restaurant,  and then Gene ate two.  We hid 70, we found 70.  Wrong, father, I ate one.  What? I told you to eat another one  so that we'd have an even number.  You said, ""You got it, toots.""  Uh, yeah, I meant it like, ""You've got it, toots,""  like you've got that certain something.  So there's still one egg we haven't found.  And it could be mine.  The competition isn't over!  I could still win!  Isn't that fun, everybody?  It's not not fun.  Also, chances are, it's mine.  - But it's probably mine. - Mine.  Ugh! This smell is worse than when Gene  kept a turkey sandwich as a secret pet for a year.  Steve Turkel. He was my best friend.  (sighs) Is it getting worse? It is, right?  Uh, w-we need to find it, like right now.  We can't. We got to open for Beef Boom.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  We'll just have to look for it  at the end of the day.  Great, because we love  looking for eggs. Right, guys?  We love, love, love it. Hmm. Uh  TEDDY: Missing egg, huh?  You know, same thing happened to a family  on my street growing up.  - They had to move out. - Mm-hmm.  Yeah. City had to burn the building down.  Uh, that can't be true.  Thanks for the masks, Teddy.  These will make it easier to search.  No problem.  Now we'll just be breathing in  this skanky perfume while we look.  ""Sensational Gardens"" is not skanky.  It's a distinctive fragrance by Kelly Ripa.  Who is very classy and from New Jersey.  BOB: We checked everywhere, and it's late.  So maybe we should just go to bed.  Oh, I don't think I could sleep with this smell.  Should we get a hotel room?  Yes. I'll make a call.  TINA: Something with a view. And robes.  LINDA: Ooh, robes.  BOB: I think I know a much better place,  and it's far more affordable.  Family sleepover!  Isn't this fun?  It's even better than a hotel.  We got sleeping bags and some free floor French fries  Free floor ketchup.  That's blood.  And what if I told you there's also a man  looking at us through the window?  - GENE: Even better. - Oh, my God, it's Mr. Fischoeder.  Uh, hi, Mr. Fischoeder.  - Hi, Bob. - Uh, if you're here for the rent,  we don't have the checkbook down here.  We also don't have the actual money.  - Um, in the bank. - Bob.  Bob, it's, it's okay. I was, (chuckles) not here for that.  I was I was just on my way to a brothel uh  brothelizer, uh uh, showcase.  Uh They're showing off this new thing  that tests how much broth you've, uh, drunk.  - Well, that's - And anyway, and I saw you here  in your pajamas and I thought, well, what the hell is that?  Uh, we lost an egg upstairs.  ""Lost an egg upstairs""?  Is that an expression that, uh, blue collar people use? Or  No, we hid the Easter eggs,  and we can't find one of them and it really smells up there.  Oh, dear, well, I hope we don't have to burn  the whole building down because of the smell.  - (gasps) - Well, that doesn't really happen.  Oh, yes, it does, Bob. Once certain smells set  into a place, you simply can't get them out.  Maybe a hamster gets lost  or Grandma dies on a hot day in August  with a plate of potato salad on her lap, say.  Aw  And, uh, and rotten eggs? Well, they're the worst.  Landlords call them ""fire starters.""  I-I'll try to remember to give you a heads up  before my friend Arson Daly stops by.  Uh, we're gonna find the egg.  Yeah, uh, we're gonna find it.  It's just hidden really well because I hid it.  - I-I probably hid it. - No.  - I-I did. - No, me.  So one of you hid it,  but neither of you knows where it is?  - We had some schnapps. - Quite a bit.  Ah. Why didn't you say so?  I lost the year 1996 to schnapps.  I still don't know what the Macarena is.  D-Don't tell me. I'll figure it out.  We have to find that egg.  -  - Wow, it's really bad.  It's unbelievably bad.  There's so much egg in the air, we could scramble it.  Wait, Lin. What are you doing?  I read online that if you are trying to remember something,  you should try to put yourself back in the environment.  And the environment I was in was schnapps.  (sniffs) Oh, God.  (gags) Oh, my God.  Bob, I'm getting something.  Really? Yeah, I was here in the kitchen.  Uh, yes, we live here.  No, no, I was in the kitchen that night.  Come on, Linda. Remember. (sniffs)  These eggs are hidden and Linda is winnin'   'Cause she is the best and Bob is a mess.   (gasps) Air vent.  I know where it is.  Thanks for coming, Teddy.  We opened the air vent, but we couldn't see it.  Oh, my God, the Sm (gags)  Ugh, Teddy, ugh, hurry.  Must've rolled down the vent.  Hold the ladder, Bob.  - I'm getting in there. - Okay.  I'm just gonna reach back here and, uh,  okay, I can feel something.  Yep, that's definitely an egg.  Oh, thank God. I knew it. I knew it.  I just got to get a better grip.  (groans, shouting)  What? What? What?  - (screams) What?! - (creature snarling)  - There's a monster in the wall! - Oh, my God.  Aah! Something's in there, and it's got the egg.  Oh. Are you guys gonna be open for lunch today,  or, uh, what's the story?  Mmm, I'm telling you, that thing had ahold of me good.  What do you think it was?  A bear maybe? Tiny dinosaur?  I-I would doubt that.  Maybe it was Aunt Gayle.  Yeah, we haven't seen her in a while.  She seems like she could be a wall person.  A Wahlberg so to speak?  Are you guys serving lunch yet?  I know it's a little early, but, uh (laughs)   I gave up beef for Lent and I'm really excited to eat a  (sniffs)  Is there a horrible smell in here?  - No. - Oh, God.  There is up in our house. Want to come smell it?  - Five bucks. - Uh, no, thank you.  Oh, crap, crap, crap.  (sniffs) It's in the restaurant.  We're not even smelling it anymore.  I-It's inside of us.  (groans) We are the smell now.  We have to close the restaurant.  Close the restaurant?  But it's Beef Boom.  Lin, it's better to lose business for a couple hours  than be the place that smells like rotten eggs  and lose business forever.  - Is that from the Bible? - (clattering)  Hey. Was that a scrabbling?  That was definitely a scrabbling.  It's Aunt Gayle. She's on the move.  Wait a minute.  That thing's in the crawlspace.  That's why it smells down here.  It's moving the egg around.  Like I did to Mom in the womb.  We got to call animal control.  That'll take forever.  Time is Beef Boom money.  We've got to get that egg out of there.  Listen, I-I-I know the crawlspace.  We know. You tell us all the time.  I'm gonna go in there,  and I'm gonna try and get the egg.  Because you know the crawlspace so well.  - Yes. - Dad, just one question.  - Do you know the crawlspace? - Okay, guys, I get it.  Bob, I'm going with you.  I'm worried you don't know the crawlspace  as well as you think you do.  Uh, you only have one jumpsuit?  What? I work for myself.  What, do you think I carry around an extra jumpsuit  conveniently in your size?  Is that what you think, Bobby?  - I-I it's fine. - Huh?  - No. - Okay, I do.  I was gonna give it to you for your birthday  and, uh, surprise you, but it's in the truck.  I'll go get it.  - This is nice. - Yeah.  What-What does it say on it?  It says, ""T.G.I.B."" Thank God It's Bob.  You get it? T.G.I I switched the ""B"" for an ""F.""  - It's very clever. - Yeah.  Are you guys in there? Can you see it?  BOB: Not yet. We're heading down to the restaurant level now.  Okay, be careful.  We'll meet you down there.  - Dad? - BOB: Yes, Tina.  If you die in the wall,  we'll name the restaurant after you.  BOB: Tina, I'm not gonna die in here.  That's right, Dad. Stay positive.  Oh, God, it smells really, really bad right here.  We must be getting close.  Let-Let's-Let's climb down.  (creature snarls)  (hisses) Oh, my God.  What? What is it, Bob?  - (screams) - Bob!  (Bob screams, thuds)  Bob, what happened?  BOB: I-I heard something hiss right in front of my face,  a-and I got scared, and then I fell.  I-I-I fell-jumped gracefully.  TEDDY: I'm coming to get you, Bobby.  BOB: No, Teddy, stay up there.  - I-It's in between the floors. - (Teddy thuds)  You jumped down.  TEDDY: Yeah. I didn't want you to be alone down here, Bobby.  What's going on in there?  BOB: Teddy was right.  There's a horrible thing in here.  So everything's fine?  I'm gonna climb up and try to see what it actually is.  TEDDY: Oh, God. Oh. Mm.  BOB: Oh, my God, it's a raccoon.  A raccoon?! Which one? Describe it.  Is it Little King Trash Mouth and his husband Gary?  Oh, right, I forgot you guys are crazy raccoon people.  What, just 'cause we watch the raccoons in the alley?  It's fun. It's like a soap opera.  It's more like an HBO miniseries.  Lots of plot twists, some nudity.  You'd like it. You just got to catch up.  Is it the king?  BOB: No, it's definitely not a him because it has babies.  Oh, a gay raccoon can't have babies?  Oh, I don't know.  I guess he could adopt or have a surrogate.  Of course he could.  What does it look like?  BOB: It looks like a raccoon.  Bob, coloring, marking, hairdo, anything distinctive.  Okay. Uh, well, it has three black rings on its tail  and its ear kind of has a notch in it.  A gauge?  Has that reached the raccoon community?  (gasps) It's Big Baby Pudding Snatcher.  I was wondering where she went.  Big Baby Pudding Snatcher. Of course.  Why do you call her Big Baby Pudding Snatcher?  LINDA: Why do you think, Bob?  Pudding cups, she snatches them.  From who?  LINDA: Me, in the alley.  Why are you eating pudding in the alley?  LINDA: Where else am I gonna eat it, Bob?  The bathroom? That's gross.  Let me in there. I'll reason with her, mom to mom.  She's probably just hormonal and not sleeping.  And I'm sure she's worried that her body may never bounce back.  I don't think that's a good idea.  She seems pretty angry.  Uh, not to put us back on topic,  but did you happen to see the egg?  BOB: Right. L-Let me look again.  Uh, hi. Sorry to bother you.  Uh, congratulations, by the way.  What a beautiful family you have.  I was just looking for an egg, so  I see it. I see the egg.  I'm gonna try and get it.  - (raccoon snarls and hisses) - (Bob screams)  BOB: Oh, bad idea!  Okay, I think we have a problem.  W-We're-We're not getting that egg.  We're gonna have to burn the building down  with Teddy and me inside.  As long as we're together.  GENE: We'll mix your ashes together  and make a manly potpourri.  - I miss Dad. - BOB: I'm right here, Tina.  I know, but it's not the same.  BOB: Listen, I need you to find out  how to lure raccoons out of a wall  so I can grab the egg.  Somebody, get the laptop.  Look up ""raccoon, babies, wall.""  Are you sure we want that in our search history?  There's such a thing as search history? Uh-oh.  Uh, I'll-I'll get it.  I'll get the computer. I'll be, uh  I might be a minute.  He looks at a lot of exotic candy online.  Okay, I think I've got something.  This site says you can sometimes drive raccoons out  by using what they call ""mild harassment.""  Keep talking.  Um, they suggest loud music and flashing lights.  Mm, that doesn't work to get me out of the tub.  (singing along with radio): Amadeus, Amadeus   Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus   Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus   Oh, oh, oh, Amadeus   Come and rock me, Amadeus  Rock me, Amadeus   Are they leaving, Dad?  BOB: No. Can we try another station?  TEDDY: No, no, no. It's good.  After this one we can change it.  Are you flashing the light?  I'm flashing it. I'm-I'm shaking it.  It's not working.  Is there anything else we can try?  It's not the end of the world, Dad.  This site says they will move on their own.  BOB: What? That's great.  Once the babies are nine weeks old.  How old are they, Dad?  BOB: I-I don't know, Tina.  They're small babies.  Okay, great. So in one to eight weeks, this'll all be over.  Ugh, so the only option is to go grab the egg,  and get my face scratched off by a rabid raccoon?  LOUISE: We'll get you a better face.  TINA: You'll finally make sense with Mom.  She's not rabid, Bob. She's a mom.  She's looking out for her kids. It's not her fault.  You're right, Lin. It's your fault!  What?! My fault?  Yes! You put an egg in a vent!  LINDA: You're just mad 'cause that's my egg in there,  and I won and you know it.  (laughs) No, this isn't a win.  You don't get to win when you cheated.  Guys, don't you see? This is tearing us apart.  Bob, you're ruining the egg hunt.  No, you are!  Stop! You both ruined it!  The egg hunt isn't fun for us!  It's all about your stupid competition.  We don't like it!  Louise, I never.  And Tina and Gene feel the same way.  Okay, she's right, we do.  - What? - You don't like the egg hunt?  It's not that we don't like it, it's just that we hate it.  You hate it?  Um, are we supposed to like it?  I mean, are Easter egg hunts for kids?  We thought they were for grown-ups.  Well, then why do you kids do it then if you hate it so much?  Because it seems like it makes you happy,  and even though it makes us unhappy,  we do it and we hate it.  Aw, that's sweet.  Well, I do it for the candy.  Okay, 75% candy, 25% you guys.  I would never eat candy that was 25% you guys.  BOB: Maybe you definitely have a point.  We might have gotten carried away with our egg competition.  I mean, I'm stuck in a wall with a raccoon,  and Mr. Fischoeder is gonna burn down our apartment.  So, no more Easter egg hunt?  That's a little extreme.  Maybe we could just cut back a little, you know?  Yeah, just hide, like, three eggs.  BOB: Uh, guys, I'm really glad we worked this all out,  but I'm still in a wall with an angry raccoon  and a very disgusting egg.  TEDDY: And me, your best friend.  Right, right, right, the egg and Big Baby Pudding Snatcher.  (gasps) That's it.  - What? - Pudding.  Teddy, I got the boards up like you said!  TEDDY: Great job, Linda!  I knew you'd be good at it.  You've got floorboard hands.  Thank you!  Okay, everybody. Open your pudding cups.  And drop!  Pudding in the hole!  - (raccoon chittering) - (gasps) I hear her, she's coming.  Dad, now!  We did it!  We're free! We're free!  Oh, God, this egg.  Ugh! (coughs) The smell.  Give it to me. I'll take it to the ocean.  Out of the way. Rotten egg.  (shouts)  Where's Teddy going?  To throw the egg in the ocean.  It's the circle of life.  I can still smell it.  Dad, you're gonna have to burn that jumpsuit.  Hey, we should burn all of Dad's clothes.  Ooh! Fun fashion bonfire, yes, baby.  - No. - Yeah, and in your face, Bob, I won.  (""Street Life"" plays)  Because there's no place I can go   Street life   It's the only life I know   Street life   And there's a thousand cards to play   Street life   Until you play your life away   Street life   Ba-da-bop-Ba-da-Ba-da-bop   Oh, street life   Ba-da-Ba!   Street life    Street life."
"1    - How was school, kids? - Actually pretty great.  So, there I was, at the drinking fountain  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my day was better.  I won the contest I entered.  We won the lifetime supply of insoles?!  - No. - Mm.  The Winthorpe Manor LARP.  Oh, I can't believe your father and I get to stay  at the actual estate where they film my favorite show  and we get to act like the Winthorpe characters.  W-Wait. I-I knew the first part.  Wh-What was the last part?  Act like the Winthorpe characters.  It still sounds wrong.  We get to stay at the house  where they film your favorite TV show.  Yes, and act like the characters from the show.  What part of LARP don't you understand?  What's a LARP?  Live Action Role Play.  - Geez, Dad, read a book. - Then act it out.  All the guests will be in character all weekend.  Oh, God. Why-Why couldn't you have won a normal contest?  Because this is the show I love, Bob.  Winthorpe Manor is the American Downton Abbey.  I thought that was Mike & Molly.  TINA: It weaves a colorful tapestry  of what life was like in 1901  for America's wealthiest textile family  and the men and women who had the privilege to serve them.  Tina, maybe you should go instead of me.  - Okay. - Oh, sorry, baby, kids can't go.  I guess they didn't have kids in 1901.  They were all working in factories,  getting covered in soot.  Ooh, lucky?  So, who's watching us this weekend?  A pushover? Not a pushover?  We prefer a pushover.  Your good friend, Teddy.  Ah, the pushover-est.  All right, off we go back in time.  Try not to alter the future.  I hope you packed toilet paper.  - I think back then it was just sheep. - I always do.  Lin, it's been 3 hours of this theme song  I know. (gasps)  Look, Bobby, there it is.  Winthorpe Manor.  BOB: That is wow.  I'm telling you, Bobby,  this is the life I was supposed to have.  I was born a hundred years too late.  God's done some good work, but he screwed up my birthday.  (panting): Hi!  Are you LARPers?  We are. I'm Marshall.  - Nancy. - Charlene.  I'm Linda. (exhales)  Whoa, look at me.  I'm wheezing up a storm, like Bernice, the cook,  when the squirrel got into her pantry.  (all laughing)  (sighs)  Oh, I-I-I've never seen the show.  (gasp)  I know. I know. It's awful. It's awful.  TEDDY: There we are.  All done. We are gonna have a weekend of fun with this thing.  Gene, you want to wear the engineer's hat?  Mm, yeah.  Nope, I'm gonna wear it. I'll let you wear it later.  All aboa (screams) Whoa!  Oh, it's my back.  I-I threw it out.  Should we call a doctor?  - Or just go ahead and put you down? - No, no, no.  I-I just need to lie here for a couple of hours.  It fixes itself.  I get it, bro.  I do that even when my back's not out.  (shouts) Sure, this isn't ideal,  but we'll still have fun.  Tell me, what-what's the train's doing?  Uh, it's going around.  (laughs) I knew it.  So, did you just die when you found out you won the contest?  Yes! I died and now I'm in  Heaven.   Hey, where's your plus one?  Oh, we do separate LARPs. It works for us.  Did everyone here win the contest?  No, just Linda and Nancy.  The rest of us have the honor  of paying a lot of money for this experience.  (gasps) Look. Someone's coming.  Esteemed paying guests and contest winners,  I welcome you to Winthorpe Manor.  My name is Mr. Perkins and I am the master of ceremonies.  Do we have any experienced LARPers in the group?  Right here. My name's Ernie.  I've done the, uh, Star Wars LARP, the Tolkien LARP,  the, uh, World According to Garp LARP  Okay, so then you know that while you're here, you will be  randomly assigned characters.  You will sleep in the room  - of your character - (gasps)  -  eat the food they ate - Mmm.   and wear their clothes.  (gasps) I can't believe it.  (gasps) William, the under-butler.  Oh, I love William.  I'll be the best William I can be,  with a keen sense of duty,  and I'm deaf in my right ear starting now.  - Oliver, the footman. - What?  Oh, uh, Oliver the footman.  Oh, oh, oh. Oh, hello, Oliver.  Oh, I'm so nervous. Okay, here it goes.  Okay, oh (gasps)  Wow, Nancy, Mrs. Winthorpe.  Good for you.  I can't believe it. Come on, Linda, let's see who you get to be.  Okay, here I go.  Iris, Mrs. Winthorpe's maid.  Goodie, we'll be working together.  Well, I won't be working.  You will, for me, but we'll be together. Yay!  Ah, I'm friggin' Mr. Winthrop. Score.  Would all the upstairs characters  please get into the auto?  - Is another car coming for us? - (laughing): Oh.  An automobile is a luxury.  Most servants go their entire lives without riding in an auto.  Right, right, right, sure.  The long walk will allow us to talk about current events.  Did you hear about those crazy Wright brothers?  They're calling it an ""aeroplane.""  More like wrong brothers. Am I right, Footman Oliver?  Oh, God.  MARSHALL: How's your syphilis?  BOB: Um, uh, it's clearing up.  Don't you all look absolutely amazing.  I trust everyone's comfortable in your wardrobes?  Uh, my uniform is itchy and it smells like mold.  As it would have in 19-aught-one,  when a servant of your stature would have worn it.  Oh. Now, just a couple of topics to go over.  While our LARP has been granted access to every nook and cranny  of this famous manor, there are just a few restricted areas:  the south wing, the east wing, the central corridor  and the entire third, fourth, and fifth floors.  Oh, whew, at least we get to go  into the gorgeous library, right?  Oh, the library is especially off limits.  We're not even supposed to look in there.  - Huh. - And tomorrow we have a  big day planned. Upstairs guests and their personal servants  will be allowed to walk through the famous tulip garden.  That's you and me.  Thank God, I was beginning to think  I wasn't gonna get to do anything exciting.  Why is a walk through the tulip garden ""exciting""?  The tulip garden is the pride of the manor.  All major plot twists happen in the tulip garden.  It's where Humphrey professed his love to Jacqueline  - on the eve of his wedding to Cicely. - Got it. Thank you.  And we'll conclude this LARP with quite a bang,  a decadent seven-course meal,  and the dessert is Mrs. Winthorpe's favorite  ALL: Seven-layer parfait flambÃ©.  It's a seven-layer parfait flambÃ©.  That's right. The upstairs guests will enjoy  an exact recreation of the two-foot-high parfait  that was served in the season finale.  It is now cocktail hour in the drawing room.  Ooh, cocktail hour in the drawing room.  Oh, which is for upstairs guests.  Oh, right.  Remember, people, this is your LARP.  Bring your characters to life.  And, Mr. Winthorpe, our cooks were, in fact,  able to provide you with a gluten-free experience.  Nice.  How's that steamed broccoli coming along?  LOUISE: Nice and steamy.  Great, 'cause I promised your folks  that I'd feed you healthy meals.  And we appreciate it.  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.  Does anyone else feel a little bad?  I mean, I know we wanted a pushover for a babysitter,  - but this is - Perfect?  - 'Cause we got a fall-over. - Right.  Should we at least bring him dinner?  Sure. Hey, Teddy!  - Teddy! - TEDDY: Yeah?  You want some dinner?!  Yeah, that'd be great, but not that healthy crap.  - Just bring me some ice cream. - Oh.  I hear this stew is the only dish  us servants get to eat all weekend.  It's everything a servant needs, right, Iris?  It's got all your salt for the day.  It's time to serve dinner upstairs.  But we just started eating.  - Spoons down! - Aah!  (whispering): This looks a lot better than the stew.  (whispering): Let's drop some on the floor  - and come back for it later. - Good idea.  Oh. That's the Burgundy glass.  - Oh, right. - Oh, Bordeaux.  At least she knows that wine goes in a glass.  - (laughs) - (chuckles)  Honey, Iris was kicked in the head by a horse.  - She was? - Yeah. In season two.  Oh, right, right, right.  Well, I think the lint pickers are fairly compensated.  - Right, babe? - Um, yes, dear.  Five cents a day is nothing to sneeze at.  Five cents a day?  It appears the footman has an opinion on the matter.  Eh. Go ahead, speak up.  Oh, w-well, I just think that with a house this, uh, grand,  you could afford to pay your workers more.  What's your name, footman?  Uh, Bob. I mean, I Oliver.  I like your moxie, Oliver.  The men will be retiring to the drawing room  for cigars and brandy now.  Come join us.  Oh, no, that-that's okay.  Yeah, it's valuable for us wealthy men  to understand a worker's perspective.  Yes, and you have a fine, vigorous mustache.  You clearly come from superior stock.  Oh, uh, thanks, I guess.  Have fun talking men stuff in the drawing room,  which I haven't even seen yet.  I'm not gonna have fun, Lin.  I don't like brandy or cigars.  One sip, one puff and I'll meet you back in our room.  I love cigars and brandy!  I finally get why people want to be rich!  TEDDY: Is it getting late?  Is it bedtime yet?  Uh, not quite.  - It's definitely not 1:00 a.m. - Mm-mm.  (groans) Well, I cannot keep my eyes open.  I don't know why.  Can you toss a blankie my way?  And if I could just trouble you  for your least favorite plastic receptacle  and a smidge of privacy.  Why? Oh. Mom's salad spinner?  That'll work.  - Lin. - Shh. I'm trying to sleep.  (whispering): Sorry. Lin.  What?  I get the appeal of this place. Hey, when we get home,  I want to watch Winthorpe Manor with you.  What are you doing?  Oh. Brushing my livery.  One of the upstairs guys lent me this brush.  They invited me on the stroll  through the tulip garden tomorrow.  (sighs) I'm glad you're having fun.  What's the matter?  It's just not how I pictured this weekend.  I mean, I serve people every day in the restaurant,  and I thought I was finally gonna get a chance  to feel like a wealthy upstairs lady.  (sighs) At least I have the tulip garden stroll  to look forward to.  Well, if you get all your work done, I guess.  - (bell ringing) - I mean, you are behind.  Uh, Mrs. Winthorpe is ringing for you, Iris.  Ugh, what does she want?  I don't know.  I've been ironing the newspaper,  which I'm not good at.  You rang?  I'd like another pillow.  Would you be so kind as to fetch me one?  Uh, sure.  - (snoring) - (bell ringing)  Really?  You'd better fetch me a bed wine.  A bed wine? Right away.  - (snoring) - (bell ringing)  Aw, come on.  Maybe one more bed wine.  No, a bed gin.  You know what, just bring them both.  Mm-hmm.  Here's just a bunch of everything  so no need to ring that bell anymore, 'Kay?  I see. (clears throat) That'll be all then.  Good night, Maid Iris.  Good night. (grumbles)  - What was that? - Sweet dreams.  TEDDY: Morning, kids!  Oh, wow, you're still right there.  Okay, maybe we should let someone besides the floor heal you.  (groans) Fine. I guess I should go  to my chiropractor, Dr. Juarez.  He's just a few blocks away.  But how are we gonna get you there?  Huh. You kids have a gurney?  Oh, we just got rid of all our gurneys.  (groans) Aw, man.  Uh, well, we're gonna have to build one, then.  Okay, you may have us confused with kids  who know things or do stuff.  Yeah, we're not gurney MacGyvers.  LINDA: Here we go, tulip time.  And why exactly are you here?  Oh, I was, uh, invited to join the stroll.  Oh, not you, Footman Oliver, her.  The chambermaids are allowed to come on the tulip garden stroll.  They are, but you aren't my chambermaid anymore.  I'm not?  No, after last night,  I decided to replace you with someone  who actually wanted the position.  Wha? Charlene?  Be excited for me, Linda.  You'll have whatever Charlene's position was.  - Wha?! - Lin, I'm so sorry.  I-I know how much you were looking forward to it.  Oliver, you coming or not?  Uh, I'll stay behind if you want me to.  No, go, go. One of us should go.  You sure? 'Cause, I mean,  I hear the tulips are in pre-bloom,  which is supposedly even better than full bloom.  - Coming! - Ugh!  Nancy and those upstairs fart-faces  are walking all over us.  Well, Iris, I don't know any Nancy  and I'm not familiar with the term ""fart-faces.""  Oh, come on, Marshall!  I know you're in there.  And I know you're just as mad about this as I am.  Okay, fine, I am angry.  I paid good money to be here, and for what?  To put some guy's socks on for him?  He can't put his own socks on?  They're socks.  Put 'em on yourself, Paul!  We didn't come to Winthorpe Manor to snip wicks.  - No, we did not! - OTHERS: No!  The servants have been stuck downstairs long enough!  Yeah! Yeah, it's true.  It's time we go upstairs!  ALL: Yeah!  Wait, what do you mean?  I'm talking about a revolt.  I'm talking about a worker uprising.  ALL: Yeah!  But first, let's finish snipping these wicks  and clean up all the wicks so it's nice and neat.  - All right. - Yeah!  MARSHALL: Are we sure about this?  A worker uprising just seems so impolite.  Yes, Marshall.  We're making this LARP ours.  Oh, wow, those were some tulips.  More like ""three-lips."" (laughs)  That-That's that's what we were saying in the garden.  You-You had to be there.  Wait, what's going on?  Can we trust him?  Yeah, I think so.  The servants are gonna revolt.  I see. Hmm, interesting.  Sure, the servants have been mistreated, no one's gonna argue that,  but we're all experiencing life  in one of the great American houses.  Will you stop pointing that thing around when you talk?  Doesn't make you sound smarter.  Yes. It. Does.  So what's the plan?  How are we gonna pull off an uprising?  Uh, we got to hit 'em where it hurts.  (gasps) Dinner.  We're gonna eat their dinner.  Yes! Tonight is the seven-course dinner  with the seven-layer parfait flambÃ©!  - Oh, wow, they're gonna be pissed. - Good!  But they're not gonna just let us eat their dinner.  Right, we got to find a way to get them out of the house.  Well, they're gonna be out of the house at the shooting party.  Shooting party?  Yeah, they're all going to shoot clay pigeons later.  I mean, I was gonna go also.  I-I don't know how this revolt affects all that.  I really kind of want to do both.  - (growls) - Mostly this.  All right, so they're already gonna be out of the house,  we just need to keep 'em out of the house.  I've got a plan!  Does it involve you shooting clay pigeons?  Yes, it does because I've always wanted to do that.  But I've got an idea that will happen  right after it's my turn to shoot.  So you guys are sure it's okay to take off the bathroom door?  Eh, it's my least favorite door, it just slows you down.  You got the hammer and the screwdriver?  TINA: Yep.  Just start at the bottom hinge and do like I told you.  Tap, tap, tap.  Tapping!  Now remember,  someone's got to hold the door or else  - (crash) - TINA: Aah! I'm okay.  Now just flop me my belly, then flop me on the door.  Just line up the door for the money flop.  Isn't it gonna hurt to move you?  Tremendously. But no matter how much I cry, keep rolling me.  - Here goes. - (kids groaning, Teddy yells)  Aah! Stop! Stop! Stop!  Aah! Stop!  Stop! Aah!  - Here comes the second flop. - (kids groaning)  Aah! (groaning in pain)  That was horrible.  But I'm on the door.  On the door-ish.  - Wha? - TINA: We'll get it this time, Teddy.  I think I know what we did wrong.  Are you sure the three of us are strong enough to lower you down?  Yup. Ropes and pulleys, simple machine.  Yeah, if anything, this is almost too safe.  Go ahead, start letting out the rope.  Go slow.  TINA: It's working.  We did it! High-five!  No, no, no! No high-fives!  Hands on ropes!  (grunting)  Oh, boy. Wheels.  We forgot, we forgot wheels!  How you doing?  Good morning.  Pull!  (gunshot, smash)  Oh, that's fun!  - Pull! - (gunshot, smash)  Oh, that's fun again!  Ugh, come on, Bobby, anytime now.  Uh, y-you guys keep shooting,  no need to look at Footman Oliver  going about his servant stuff.  (coughs) Whoops, syphilis cough.  Let's fire up the engine.  (engine starts)  What's happening?  - Why are the servants in the auto? - Eh?  - Iris? - Bob, let's go!  Footman Oliver, what's going on?  Yeah, I-I better see what that's all about.  It's a servant uprising!  We're gonna eat your dinner.  Our end-of-LARP seven-course dinner?  Our end-of-LARP seven-course dinner.  (all panting)  But we're still on  for cigars and brandy later, right?  - LOUISE: Coming through, people! - (Teddy groaning)  Make way!  Move your stroller!  Teddy, no one's looked this good on a door  since Kate Winslet in Titanic.  How's the patient?  The pain levels are through the roof.  But this view is unbeatable.  It took throwing out my back to appreciate  how beautiful the power lines are in this  Aah! In this town!  Aah!  LOUISE: We're here. Wait, what?  KIDS: Closed?! TINA: Look, he left a note.  ""Closed today for my niece's  - quinceaÃ±era."" - Aw.  Ah, dang it, today's Teresa's quinceaÃ±era?  Juarez has been talking about that for months.  I bet they're tearing the roof off that rec hall.  I can't believe we came all this way only to be stopped  by a beautiful rite of passage.  We're not.  We're going to that quinceaÃ±era!  I'm not dressed for that!  LINDA: Did you lock all the doors?  Yes, there were so many, but they're locked.  It started raining out there.  And it's getting dark.  - I hope the guns are okay. - All right,  who's hungry?  - (all cheer) - All right, all right, calm down.  Mm. This feels so wrong but tastes so right.  Would anyone mind if I smoked between courses?  Smoke 'em if you got 'em.  Oh, now I get that.  There's only one course left, and we all know what it is.  (squeals) Mrs. Winthorpe's seven-layer parfait.  Now let's flambÃ¨ that sucker.  - NANCY: Drop that match! - Uh (stammers)  blow it out and then drop it, or just drop it?  I'm-I'm gonna blow it out first.  Marshall! (whispers): Sorry.  How'd you even get in? The doors were all locked.  Not the aviary.  Damn it, Charlene.  There were so many doors.  Wow, you guys made good time.  Where the hell'd you get that pocket watch?  Oh, I-it's on loan from the estate.  My character Oliver uses it, so, yeah.  That parfait is ours.  We put up with your crap all weekend; the parfait is ours.  Eating our friggin' seven-course meal wasn't enough?  No, it wasn't!  (grunts) What the hell has gotten into you people?  Oh, and mud is getting tracked into the dining room!  I can kiss that cleaning deposit good-bye.  LARPs aren't supposed to have uprisings.  He's right.  Look, wait, stop, everyone.  Yes, we did enjoy the seven-course dinner,  so maybe we can share the parfait together, as equals.  Equals? Ha!  You silly, simple woman.  Now clean me off and feed me that parfait.  Nancy,  don't you remember what it was like we before we came here?  No! We've always been here.  - Oh, boy. - Get that parfait!  I tried! Come on, servants!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Off limits! You're going off limits!  LARP time-out. LARP time-out.  (sighs) I'm guessing you haven't been sleeping  with a pillow between your knees, like we talked about?  Dr. Juarez, I always appreciate your tips,  and I know we're crashing your beautiful quinceaÃ±era,  but I just need you to crack my back.  Fine, fine. Relax and let go.  - (groaning) - You're not letting go.  Teddy, relax.  - I need you to let go. - (exclaims)  (bones crack, relieved sighing)  - There we are. - That's what I was looking for.  And if you can just tap your two toes together.  Tap your big toes together.  (exclaims) (bones crack, Teddy yells)  That's what I'm looking for.  Teddy, can I try, can I try, can I try?  Not right now, Gene. Maybe later.  You did it, Doc.  Oh, you sweet, sweet angel, Dr. Juarez.  Yes.  Have you changed your policy about kissing?  Not yet, not yet.  (pants) There's got to be a place to gobble this up.  The library. Quick, In there!  Eh, you're not supposed to go in the library.  Bob!  All right, Marshall, let's heat it and eat it.  - Will you look at that. - Whoa.  - Just like on the show. - (door rattles)  Oh, you found us, huh?  (groaning loudly)  The door's locked.  Enjoy the view.  (growls)  You'd better not.  Watch me.  Mmm.  (grumbling)  (distorted): That's my parfait!  Oh, my God!  (grunts)  No!  (all yelling and eating)  MR. PERKINS: That's it!  You're all kicked out!  (engine sputtering softly)  So good LARP?  I loved it.  LINDA: You know,  I think we put that era on a pedestal  maybe a little too much.  Life was horrible back then  if you weren't in the super-upper class.  I'm just glad that we live in a time where there are no classes.  I-I get what you were going for.  Unrelated, we may have left the bathroom door at the rec hall.  Wait, what?  But it's probably happier there.  Yeah, what kind of life was it living here?  I mean, if that door could talk.  It'd better keep its damn mouth shut!  So, who wants to watch Winthorpe Manor?  Me! I'll get the brandy!  BOB:  Winthorpe Manor   LINDA:  Winthorpe Manor   BOB:  Winthorpe Manor   BOTH:  Winthorpe Manor, Winthorpe Manor   Winthorpe Manor   BOB:  It's Winthorpe Manor   LINDA:  Winthorpe Manor   BOB:  Break it down now   (Bob beat-boxing) LINDA:  Winthorpe Manor   Don't forget your manners   Who's a party planner?   Climbin' up the social ladder   BOTH:  Winthorpe Manor"
"1    Happy birthday.  - It's your special birthday breakfast. - Oatmeal?  - That's a muffin. - Oh.  Didn't bake all the way through.  Still good, though. It's made with love.  - And no flour, by accident. - Mm.  Mom's not a baker, Dad.  She's a modern-day woman.  Yeah, don't expect things to be  baked all the time, you sexist pig!  Well, happy birthday to me.  So, you want to do anything special for your big day?  Well, we don't have to do anything special.  I'm happy just having my muffin soup  and reading the newspaper.  Can't we have one place in this house  that's safe from reading?!  - Oh, my God. - What? What is it?  The planetarium is having  its last ever rock and roll laser show.  And it's happening tonight.  Guys, it's Dad's birthday,  so let's pretend we all know what he's talking about.  A laser light show, Tina,  is when they take a classic rock and roll album  and bring it to life with lasers.  And they're doing the best one: General Inzanity by Zentipede.  I went to that a couple times as a kid.  I was a little bit into it.  - Yeah! - (rock music playing loudly)  This is amazing!  I can't believe this is the last one.  - Why are they ending it? - I don't know.  I mean, the music's kind of old.  And the lasers are kind of old.  The people who like it are mostly kind of  - Old? - I was gonna say cool.  Hey, maybe we could go to this, for my birthday.  Yeah. Great idea.  Right, kids?  - Sure. Sure. - Sure. Yes?  Sounds like you guys aren't interested.  - No. - What?  I am. Going out, watching lasers.  It's what I always imagined Future Gene would be into.  Hey, you two can go together.  Yes, this one has Dad and Gene written all over it.  That would be fun. Gene?  Let's do it.  And while the boys are away,  maybe us girls can have dinner with Gretchen.  She's been bugging me to hang out.  Sure. I like Gretchen. She's your friend who swears.  She's a cool sassy ""B"" who don't take ""S"" from anyone.  Oh, my God. This muffin is That's really bad.  I wasn't awake yet! I hadn't had coffee!  Zentipede laser light show.  I can't believe it.  Gene, it's gonna be so much fun.  You keep saying ""Zentipede"" like it's a real thing.  Zentipede is the band.  I brought their General Inzanity album on CD.  I-I could play it for you.  - Sure. - Or wait, wait, wait.  Maybe you shouldn't know too much going in.  I-I think it'll be better that way.  - Like the Iraq war. - Sort of.  Gretchen works at the mall now? I thought she did hair.  She does. She's working at some salon called Special Girl.  Uh, I don't think this is a salon.  (gasps) So many dollies!  This is intense.  Are there enough girly girls in the world  to support a place like this?  (Tina groans)  Tina, what's wrong, sweetie?  I think they're creepy. I mean  (whispers): I think they're creepy.  I think they're sweet.  Ooh! Look at that one.  What pretty eyes. Like Donna Mills.  (groans) I don't really like her eyes.  (growling): Do you like my eyes?  - (screams) Louise! - She doesn't like my eyes!  - Stop it. - I know that's you.  Hey, look, there's Gretchen.  What do you know, she is doing hair.  - Hey, Gretch. - Hey, Linda.  Excuse me a second.  I'm supposed to talk to them like they're real  or my manager gets in my face.  You want a magazine or something?  Okay, whatever.  This place is a scream. I love it.  Gretchen, do you miss working with, like, real live people?  Ah, screw live people.  Most of 'em tip worse than the dolls.  (laughs)  You get it. Anyway,  I thought we could use my employee discount  in the Special Girl restaurant.  (gasps) There's a restaurant here, too?  The next time I complain  that our restaurant is sad, remind me about this.  Let me just finish giving this little lady a blowout.  She's going to an incredibly important sleepover  this weekend. Right?  Mm-hmm. Huge.  All right. Settle down.  BOB: There she is, Gene.  The planetarium.  So this place was your only friend, huh?  Basically. Hmm.  Looks like they're renovating it.  What's that smell?  It's like a skunk is smoking.  That's, uh, probably what it is.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Big man.  Sold out show. You got tix?  Not anymore. I use a spray and a medicated collar  and I stay out of tall grass.  Uh, Gene, he's selling tickets. He's a scalper.  Uh, w-we're good, thanks.  I've also got, uh, tube socks.  And, uh, slap bracelets? Ouch.  Uh, we're, uh No, thanks.  Come on, Gene, let's go.  Or you can wear 'em as a choker.  Ouch. You're really hurting yourself.  Uh, we're gonna pass. Thanks.  Any bags?  Just this old bag.  (chuckles) Gene.  No ins and outs. No exceptions. Understand?  Got it. Come on, buddy. We're doing this.  - (whoops) - I've got the need  for Zentipede!  (gasps) It's adorable!  Oh, my God.  Yep, and they serve alcohol.  I know you were wondering, Linda.  - Yeah. Yeah, I was. - Mm-hmm. Yeah.  (chuckles) Yeah. Welcome.  Did you bring dolls this evening,  or will you be needing one of our dinner dolls?  - What are dinner dolls? - You need a doll to eat here.  Like some restaurants say ""Jacket required""  or ""Ma'am, that bathing suit needs a bottom.""  Oh, so we get to eat with our very own dolly.  (groans)  Seriously? Is this a joke?  Not at all. But you know who likes funny jokes?  Jillian! Her daddy's a circus clown in 1903,  - and she wants to be just like him. - Get it out of my face.  - Yeah, no clowns. - Okay. How about you?  - (screams) - Okay.  Yeah, all the dolls come with a story like that.  Come on, just pick one. I'm starving.  Can I get some bread sticks?  Is that going back to the kitchen?  Aren't these seats great?  Wine me, dine me and recline me.  (electronic music begins playing)  Gene, here we go.  GENE: Fog machines? This is promising!  See you on the other side, buddy.  (whoops)  Zentipede!  (rock music playing loudly)  Ow! That's loud!  What'd you say?  Uh, uh  Oh boy.  Oh, God. (groaning)  Here it comes, man. Here it comes.  Here what comes, lollipop hippie?!  (wild screaming, rock music continues loudly)  (screaming)  Gene, are you okay?  I want to go! I want to go right now!  A-Are you sure? Because the  (screaming)  Oh, you seem sure.  Don't make me go back in there! (hyperventilating)  Gene, it's okay. It's okay.  Take a breath.  - Not that fast. - (groans loudly)  Look, look, look, Gene, Gene.  Do you want to go back in or do you want to go home?  Home! I mean, maybe.  Uh, it's your birthday, so  Don't-don't worry about that.  I-I won't enjoy the show if you're not enjoying it.  Okay, let's go home.  Or we could go back in  and I could help you get through it,  - 'cause it's just the beginning and - (screams)  All right, all right. Right, right. W-We'll go.  - We'll go. We'll go home. - Good plan.  I know it's your birthday, but you didn't tell me  that was going to be the loudest, scariest thing ever.  I'm sorry, Gene. Now that I think of it,  I was, like, 16 when I went.  11 is probably pretty young.  This is like when you let me watch Beaches all over again.  Right.  And Terms of Endearment,  and then Kramer vs. Kramer.  What the hell?!  - I was on a kick. - Ah!  L-Let's just go home.  I mean, the music was pretty great, right?  How could you tell? It was so loud.  Well, if you want, I could play you a song or two  at normal volume, and we could listen while we drive.  Okay.  (rock music playing over stereo)  ROBOT: Attention, humans of America.  I am General Inzanity, and I have seized control.  Control. Control!  Who's General Inzanity?  Oh, he's an evil robot army general  who takes control of the government in the year 2007,  which used to be a long time in the future.  An evil robot army general, you say?  Yeah. The songs tell a story. It's a rock opera.  Well, they called it a ""rock-sperience,""  - which is dumber. - Beg to differ.  So, General Inzanity starts cracking down on rockers  who are just trying to have a good time.  But there's one rocker  who fights back. He's a rebel.  Na is ""The Rebel.""  As a teenager, I kind of related to him.  - Of course. - Yeah.  Anyway, The Rebel writes a song that inspires people  to rise up against General Inzanity.  It's called ""Let My People Rock. Part One.""  L-Let me skip to that one.  We don't need no bots   We don't need no bots   Let my people rock   Let my people rock   -  We are not machines  - (Bob mouthing along)  We like to wear tight jeans   Catchy.  So, then what happens?  BOB: Well, hold on. Let's do this right.  Nice.  All right, imagine this is really cool lasers.  - Okay. - So, General Inzanity arrests the hero  and sentences him to hard labor in a rock quarry.  - Could happen. - BOB: And all day,  the hero pushes these boulders up a mountain  to build General Inzanity a new evil lair.  GENE: Mm.  BOB: And then these rebel fighters show up,  and they try to help the hero escape,  but instead, they get trapped  on top of the mountain, surrounded by the robot army.  And that's when The Rebel gets the idea  to roll the boulders down on the robots.  You mean he rolls rocks  To save rock and roll.  Oh, my God.  (chuckles) The plot is not subtle.  I like it.  Oh, I haven't even told you about the best part:  the climax of the whole thing.  It's, actually, it's-it's hard to describe.  I mean, I don't want to oversell it,  but it changes you forever.  I want to see it. Did we miss it?  Did we miss the climax?  Really? You want to go back?  Yes? Kind of?  I mean, maybe it's worth going deaf  and peeing in my pants a little.  Also, it's your birthday.  Wait, Gene, don't go back for me.  I'm not doing this for you.  I'm doing this for me. And you.  Now come on.  Hello, ladies.  My name's Andrew. I'll be your server.  Let's get you started with those cinnamon buns you ordered.  Cinnamon buns? We didn't order these.  You didn't order them, huh? Uh-oh.  It must've been one of the dolls.  - Oh. - My guess is Becky,  because her favorite food is cinnamon buns.  Says so on her info card.  Well, that's Becky for you.  (laughs) You bring the cinnamon buns  and say a doll ordered 'em. I love it.  (mouth full): This better not show up on the check.  - I know the tricks. - They're complimentary.  Well, they should be free.  - Um, waiter? - Yes.  If my doll orders anything, could you warn me?  - Sure thing. - And is she looking at me?  - Now? No. - Oh, good, good, good.  - But now she is. - (screams)  Okay, I'll give you ladies and your dolls  a moment to look at the menu.  FYI, the dinner dolls must stay in the restaurant area.  They're not store dolls, they're dinner dolls.  They've accepted it. So should you.  So, let's see. Let's read about Becky.  Let's get to know her.  It says here Becky is the daughter  of a rich merchant in the 1890s.  Whenever that was.  Okay, I'll play. My doll's name is Suzie.  She was the first girl to wear glasses in public.  Which is pretty cool.  My doll keeps pulling her dress over her head. Stop it!  How about yours, Tina?  Yeah, tell us about Little Winky.  - What's her deal? - Ugh. Her name is Francine.  She's a ballerina.  (chuckles): Ballerina? Whoa.  How do they come up with this stuff?  ""Francine joined an American ballet troupe  ""that toured the world at the beginning of the Cold War.  ""While in Europe, she was recruited  to spy on the Russians.""  Ooh!  What a weird, serious little doll.  She's a spy?  Okay, her I like.  Really? Then maybe she could sit with you and Suzie. (chuckles)  (whispers): Help me.  - Uh, okay. Sure. - Thanks. Thanks.  Gretchen, your doll's on the floor, hon.  Oh, look at you. You're all dirty!  What are you doing down there?  No ins and outs!  - Can we buy new tickets? - Sold out!  We could be seat fillers  when the celebrities in the audience go to the bathroom.  - No. - Aah! You're impossible!  Gene, look. It's the scalper.  Uh, pardon me. Hey.  Wait. What are you mad about?  Tickets, socks or marijuana?  No. No. What? I-I wanted to see if you have any more tickets for sale.  Is obstructed view okay?  Sure. Then you can try watching from here.  (wheezing laugh) Sorry.  Huh. That's a scalper joke.  - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh, man. I'm out of tickets.  Crap!  All right, well, we gave it a shot, Gene.  I-I guess it wasn't meant to happen.  I mean, uh, there is a way to sneak in,  but it's not for beginners who don't buy slap bracelets.  Please! It's his birthday!  - He's not gonna have that many more. - Gene.  (sighs) All right.  It's risky, but if you give me $20,  we'll get you into the laser show.  Okay, but how? We-we want to get in  before the big finish, and that's any minute.  All will be revealed when you give me $25.  Wait. You just said $20.  Throw in your slappiest slap bracelet,  and you've got a deal!  Okay, here's 25 bucks. So, uh, what do we do?  Well, first, allow me. Bam!  - Ow. - Slappy birthday, Dad.  On this paper, you'll find a phone number.  It's the direct line to the concession stand inside.  Call it, and when the guy picks up, give him the pass phrase.  What's the pass phrase?  The pass phrase is  (whispering, rattled coughing)  Oh, God.  Word to the wise: two guys work at the concession stand.  One is cool, the other is not.  Okay. Um, what are their names?  - They're both named Nick. - Oh. Nice.  If the uncool Nick answers, hang up right away.  How are we supposed to know which Nick we're talking to?  You'll know the cool Nick,  'cause, you know, he sounds cool.  Okay.  - Another word to the wise. - Mm.  The uncool Nick knows we do this,  so sometimes he tries to sound cool,  and he's very good.  It's almost impossible to tell the difference.  Oh, my God.  I guess we'll feel it out. Thank you.  If you get caught, you do not know me. I'm out!  Look at him go! His ponytail's like a propeller!  He's gonna take off!  Miss, we have your chicken fingers,  and for your dolls, our best  plastic spaghetti.  That's why I love this gal.  She's watching the Russians,  but she's not watching her carbs.  Well, Francine's getting discontinued,  so now's the time to live it up.  Wait, what? What did he mean, uh, ""discontinued""?  Mm, sometimes they stop making a certain doll,  so they get rid of the whole stock.  Usually, they donate 'em to poor kids.  - Huh, that's nice. - But that's just the new dolls.  For these dinner dolls, it's different.  They get dinged up, so discontinued dinner dolls  get put in a sort of  - It's a sort of like a - W-What?  I guess you'd call it like a a chipper-shredder for dolls.  (gasps) What?!  Yeah, it turns 'em into this shredded stuff.  They use it in the mat material over in the play area.  Sometimes an eye doesn't get shredded,  and it looks like a kid is down there staring at you!  (laughing)  (Gretchen clears throat)  It's pretty messed up when you think about it.  Just sipping my wine.  - (line ringing) - GENE: You got this, Dad.  Remember, hang up if the uncool Nick answers.  MAN: Hello?  Uh, h-hello. Is this the concession stand?  - Yeah. - Uh, can you, um  tell me about, uh, some of the concessions you have?  - We have sweet snacks. - Mm.  - Salty snacks. - Nice.  Some snacks that kind of straddle the line.  - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - (quietly): Cool Nick or Uncool Nick?  - (whispers): I can't tell. - Let me.  Congratulations. You've been selected for a survey.  Do you ever say things like, ""Boy, I sure am cool  - compared to my coworker Nick""? - I'm Nick.  No, I know, but which one?!  - Gene, give me the phone. - Ah!  Hi. Uh, it's me again.  Uh, what would you do if I told you,  ""The moons of Uranus are on fire""?  Oh, did the scalper guy say  there's a cool Nick and a not-cool Nick,  and you have to know the pass phrase or something?  - Yeah, yeah. - Sorry, I forgot.  Sometimes I pretend to be two different guys named Nick  just to mess with him. It's really boring here.  - Anyway, you want to get in? - Yes, please.  All right, meet me around back in three minutes.  - Bring 20 bucks. - I already paid the scalper.  Well, I'm not the scalper, am I?  I'm two guys named Nick.  Fine. Around back. Three minutes.  If you're not there, I'm not waiting.  All right, first of all, there's only one Nick.  - What?! - I know. I can't explain right now.  We have to meet him around back in three minutes.  Around back in three minutes?  Oh. Yeah. That's far.  Dad, I think we're gonna have to run.  - No, Gene. - I just don't see any other way.  But I can't.  - I think we're gonna have to. - (sighs) Okay.  So, walk first and build up speed,  or just start running?  - J-Just start, I think! Just start! - Oh, God.  Watch! This is what I think it is!  (Gene murmuring gibberish)  LOUISE: I mean, I know she's just a frickin' doll,  but she's the only cool one they have.  And they want to toss her into a doll shredder?  Sorry, Louise.  Yeah, I shouldn't have said anything.  Well, maybe we can buy Francine and give her a new home with us.  No! I mean, okay, I'm fine with it.  Oh, I don't think they'll sell  Uh, excuse me, waiter?  Everyone good? How are the cinnamon buns sitting  with those chicken fingers?  Not great. Listen, how much would it cost  to buy one of the dolls? Say, this doll right here?  - Oh, one of the dinner dolls? - Yeah.  - Those aren't for sale. - Why not?  Well, the Special Girl Corporation  wouldn't sell a dirty old dinner doll.  - What?! - Ouch.  Oh, excuse me. There's a doll over there  who's trying to get my attention.  Ugh!  New plan, everybody.  We grab Francine and make a break for it.  They can't take us down, not all of us.  Nuh-uh. No. I can't lose this job.  I still have payments  on that Jet Ski I crashed seven years ago.  But maybe I can still help you out.  - That doll she's a spy, right? - Yeah.  Then she must be pretty good with disguises, huh?  Huh.  (panting) Oh, God.  Everything hurts.  Just imagine yourself inside the planetarium,  having an amazing climax.  Gene, that's Never mind.  That must be the door. Did we make it?  Maybe we're early. Are we in shape now?  - Should we wear tank tops? - Maybe.  - What is that? - It's Pluto,  the disgraced ex-planet.  - Oh. I guess they're throwing it away. - In my class, we pulled all the Plutoâs  off our solar system models,  and then stomped them into the ground.  It's him!  - Come on, let's go! - No, Dad! Wait!  Oh, my God, we've got to get to that door.  Planetariums are so stressful.  Why didn't you warn us, Neil deGrasse Tyson?!  Hello? Anybody there?  Nick's not gonna wait.  But if we go, the security guard will see us. We won't get in.  Closing the door.  Closing it slowly.  No. Let my people rock. Part one.  - (grunting) - What are you doing?  Dad, help.  What the hell?  It's heading for the employee parking lot.  This is why everyone hates you, Pluto!  - Go, go, go, go, go! - Hold the door!  - We're here! - Oh. Hey.  Gene, that was amazing!  You rolled a rock to save rock and roll.  And now, to celebrate, you can give me $20.  Oh, right. Here.  We got to hurry, Gene. Let's get to our seats.  Thanks, Nick. Cool Nick.  I'm gonna miss you guys.  It sounds like they're at the part right before the climax.  - Uh-huh. - You okay?  Uh-huh. I think so?  Gene, you can do this, and it'll be worth it, I hope.  - Zentipede? - Zentipede!  - Wait. - (rock music playing)  Uh, can I borrow a napkin? Thanks.  I can make you ear plugs with this.  (groaning)  Gross. And thank you.  (rock music continues)  What we got to do is make this doll look like a doll  that isn't getting discontinued,  so we got to sneak her to my salon station.  But the waiter said  dinner dolls weren't allowed outside the restaurant.  Yeah, and he's been hovering.  Don't worry. I'll deal with him.  Oh, waiter?  Well, what can I do for you at this late stage in your meal  when most people are done asking things from the waiter?  Can you pretty please box this up for us?  That's the doll's food. That stays in the restaurant.  But could you pretend to box it up  and bring it out and say, ""Here's your boxes""?  Uh, yes, ma'am, I can do that.  All right. Go! Go!  Get a Sabrina doll from the shelves up front.  Okay.  Then go to accessories and get a Sabrina dress,  a Sabrina headband and Sabrina shoes.  - Got it. - Meet me at my station ASAP.  And don't act suspicious.  Pretend you're a little girl.  Pshh. I'll try.  (rock music playing loudly)    BOB: Yeah! This is amazing!  Zentipede!  LOUISE: Hard to believe that's her.  You're good, lady.  Thanks. Let me do your mop sometime.  Hey, easy. Easy. Wait.  What if they discontinue Sabrina?  The one we stuck with the dinner dolls will get shredded.  Oh, they're never gonna discontinue Sabrina.  Sabrina pays the bills in this place.  So what do you think?  Should we put Little Miss Winky back on the shelf?  Or we could buy her.  Bring this little spy in from the cold?  With Gretchen's discount, it shouldn't be too bad.  Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!  Uh, I don't think so.  Look at Tina. I mean, she has enough problems.  Let's just leave Francine here and know that  we helped a girl out of a tough spot.  Hey, you know what? I'll be fine.  I'm, like, so comfortable with this doll.  - My phobia is gone. - Really?  Yeah. See how normal I'm acting?  All right!  - Thanks, T. - No sweat.  - (rock music playing) - So, the laser show,  it holds up, right?  I mean, you've never seen it before,  but could you sense it holding up?  - I loved it. - What?  Sorry. Talk louder. My hearing's kind of shot.  (shouting): I said I loved it, Dad!  (loudly): I love you, too, Gene.  Roll a rock to rock and roll-a   Roll a rock to rock your soul   A rock to rock and roll-a   Robots don't get rock and roll-a   Roll a rock to rock and soul"
"1    (panting)  Did you get it? Linda, did you get it?  - Ha, I got it! (whoops) - Yes!  What are you, uh what are you guys talking about?  The bake sale! The Wagstaff School Bake Sale.  - What am I talking about. - Oh, right.  - (sighs) - You-you know about that?  Yeah. Linda told me about it.  She ran it three years ago, and Colleen Caviello tanked it  to make Linda look bad.  Yeah. She went behind my back and told everyone  to bring banana bread.  - So we had nothing but banana bread. - BOB; Oh, right.  - I looked like an idiot. - Y-You did.  And ever since then, Colleen's taken it over  and run that bake sale like it's her own exclusive club.  But now it's Linda's turn again!  Yeah. Mr. Frond called last night.  I'm gonna show Mean Colleen Cavi-smello how it's done.  So, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Back up. You knew last night?  - Yeah. - And you didn't call me?  - Um - That's fine.  I was up thinking about it, but that's fine.  - Oh. Yeah. - (phone rings)  Bob's Burgers. This is Linda.  Mr. Frond! You must be calling about the bake sale!  I was thinking we could do a theme,  like Masquerade or Vegas, Baby!  Oh, no! Okay. One of us will be right there.  Louise is in big trouble,  and one of us has to go down to the office.  Oh. Okay. You?  Yeah, me. I just got the bake sale.  I am not gonna lose it because one of our kids is a delinquent.  Right.  You've worked too hard, Linda! You've come too far.  - Do not lose this! - Okay, okay. I'm not.  Don't lose it!  - I'm not! - Where's your keys?  You have everything? Where's your purse?  Oh, my keys, my keys.  Oh, my God. My-my purse. Ugh. Okay.  Wait, wait, wait! Let me fix your hair. Hold on.  I got to go! I got to go!  Okay, okay. Go!  FROND: Are you familiar with  in-school suspension, Linda?  Uh, is it like you're suspended  - but you stay at school? - Mm, not exactly.  It's Yes, that's basically it.  We've found that regular suspension was like a day off  for the children, whereas in-school suspension  is more punitive and educational.  They sit alone in a room, supervised by me,  and write an essay on what they did wrong.  What did Louise do wrong?  She pulled down a boy's pants,  exposing his underpants.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. I only did it because  Timmy and Scott O'Brien took Pocket Sized Rudy's lunch  and wouldn't give it back.  He's so little. He needs to eat.  - And no one else was helping. - Oh.  Knowing the O'Brien brothers, that's probably true, Louise,  - but - Thank you!  Am I a hero? I don't know.  But Wagstaff has a zero tolerance pantsing policy.  We're part of a national program  called No Pants Pulled Off Behinds.  Your actions were not appropriate.  (groans)  Well, sounds like she was trying to help another kid.  Yes! I was!  Linda, zero tolerance means zero tolerance.  Not some tolerance. Are we not on the same page?  Oh! Uh, no, same page. Absolutely.  We're gonna be working together on that bake sale,  and now this whole thing happens, you know?  What a crazy world.  Mm. Yes, the bake sale.  It's nice that you stuck up for the little guy, Louise,  but what you did was wrong. Real wrong.  Great. Thanks, Mom.  I just need you to sign this permission slip  acknowledging Louise will spend the rest of the day  in in-school suspension  and that you will come pick her up after school.  That's what you get for sticking your neck out  and doing the right thing. I'll just keep my head down  - and mind my own business.  - Hmm.  (groans) Shoot. I completely forgot.  I have to take my mother to the podiatrist.  She has six ingrown toenails.  - On one foot. - (gags)  Ooh, she sounds nice.  Anyway, we can ask Ms. Schnur to supervise Louise.  I'm sure she'll agree.  - No. - Please, Ms. Schnur.  I wouldn't ask if it weren't an emergency.  I'm busy today. I'm looking up how every celebrity looks  - without makeup. - Come on.  You can see the door from your desk.  All you have to do is make sure no one goes in or out.  Ugh, fine.  Thank you. You really are the best person for the job.  I know. I'm like that guard in Shawshank Redemption.  Nothing gets by me.  Have you seen Shawshank Redemption?  Not all the way through. No spoilers!  Okay. And, Louise, any funny business  and you'll get in-school suspension for a week.  (sighs) Never helping anyone again.  Okay, I'm, uh, gonna take Louise in there  to give her one last good talking-to before I go.  Good. All right.  I'm off to the podiatrist, Dr. Cornsander.  (laughing)  Just kidding. It's His name is Dr. Hand, ironically.  Uh, uh Okay, I'm leaving.  What you did was very bad, Louise!  And I want you to put it all in your essay!  - Why are you yelling? - There are rules, Louise!  And you got to learn to follow 'em!  What are you doing?  (whispers): You'll see. Just be quiet.  (loud thud)  Uh, I just tripped over two chairs and a  and a desk! And that's what made that loud sound!  Now get out some paper and start writing, Miss Missy!  (whispering): I'm gonna lower you out the window.  Leave your stuff here and meet me at the car.  I don't want to talk you out of anything,  but why are you doing this?  (strained): You did something nice for someone.  Now I want to (grunts) do something nice for you.  LOUISE: Wait, wait, wait, wait!  Ow. Sorry.  - LINDA: Go to the car. - This is crazy.  Go. Go, go, go.  And we'll talk more about this after school.  Did you hear any of that?  I hope I wasn't too hard on her.  Anyway, she's in there really learning her lesson,  and you won't hear a peep out of her.  Good. I hate hearing peeps.  (engine starts)  - We clear? - Ah!  - (tire screech) - Louise! You scared me!  What are you Oh, right, yeah, this was my idea.  Yeah, and what exactly is the idea? What are we doing?  Well, listen, what you did was wrong.  Yeah, everybody made that pretty clear.  But I don't want you getting the idea  that helping people isn't worth it, Louise,  'cause it is, it is worth it.  So, come on, give me your hand. Look at me, give me your hand.  Okay.  So, my genius mom plan is to reward you  for the good part of what you did  by taking you out for ice cream.  Keep talking.  Then we'll pop you back in the window,  and you can write your essay and no one will be the wiser.  Or we could blow off the whole essay thing,  keep driving and start new lives in Boca.  My hair? In Boca?  What are you in that humidity?  What are you kidding me?  (doorbells jingle)  All right, Bob's Burgers, we made it.  We must be the first.  Hi, welcome. ""The first""?  Oh, yeah, there's a bunch of us coming here.  This is our meeting point.  Your meeting point? A-Are you just meeting or also eating?  All of it. We dropped some of our group on the way here,  but they'll show up.  Eventually. (laughs)  Ha! Eventually.  Right?  ""The Glory Glory JalapeÃ±o Burger."" Sounds perfect.  - Two Burgers of the Day, please. - You got it.  - Does that come with cheese? - Uh, yeah.  All right, well, same here, but no cheese.  - Okay. - Two for me, too.  Oh. You guys are hungry, huh?  We're burning about 4,000 calories on this ride, so, yeah.  Yeah, we'll start with two and then maybe have a third.  - (laughs) - Wow.  - It's good to be young, huh? - I'm 49.  Oh, my God, I have to start working out.  - Yes, you do. - Oh, boy. Here are the stragglers.  Hi. Let me just clear this booth for you guys,  and I'll be right back to take your order.  Bob, you're swamped. Let me get that for you.  What? No. Teddy, I mean, thanks,  but don't worry about it.  Why not? I can't clear a table?  It's so very difficult that only you can do it?  I'm fine, Teddy. I got it.  Fine? Okay, it's fine.  Okay. It's fine! I got it!  Okay, great!  So can you get me some more coffee  when you get a chance?!  Sorry about him.  No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.  BOB: Oh, boy.  (quietly): Louise, are you in there?  We heard from Regular Sized Rudy  who heard from Pocket Sized Rudy  that you got in-school suspension.  It's us, Tina and Gene. This is Tina.  No answer. I'm going in.  Gene, no. If we get caught going in there,  we'll get suspended, too.  It happened to Jimmy Jr. When he tried to talk to Zeke.  - It's true. - So courageous.  So now whenever Zeke's suspended,  I just pass him notes.  Those notes really lifted my spirits, J-Ju!  - Get over here! I got to tell you! - Ow, Zeke!  - I appreciate it! - (grunts) Ow. Ah!  I appreciate the hell out it!  - (groaning) - Zeke. Come on, I appreciate you!  - (Zeke grunting, Jimmy Jr. coughs) - Hey!  - GENE: Ah! - Get away from there.  No talking to the suspendee.  Stay strong, Louise, bye.  'Sup, girl?  What's up, Zeke? New shorts?  (laughs) Yeah.  All right, go to class.  - All right. Bye! - Bye.  You know, I used to get into trouble  for sticking up for my friends.  - You did? - Uh-huh.  I pantsed a guy, too.  Yeah, Kenny Kotarski.  He was making fun of Vicki Tufo's forehead.  She had an enormous forehead.  Like scary big.  Anyway, I even got his underwear.  Everyone saw everything.  (laughs): What?  Mom. What other bad stuff did you do?  One time, me and your Aunt Gayle  filled up a bunch of water balloons,  and we went in the bathroom and threw them at the girls  that were pooping.  Wait, who were you sticking up for?  Oh. Well, I mean, they were mean girls.  They were, they were mean pooping girls.  Hey, aren't you supposed to be at the restaurant?  Don't you work there?  Oh, what, like we're getting a big rush today?  (laughs)  (doorbells jingle, busy chatter)  I like those outfits.  - Thanks.  - I put on spandex once.  - I couldn't get it off for a week. - Uh-huh.  Yeah. Went to the E.R.  Doctor said if I was even five minutes later,  I would've lost a foot.  That was a fun Easter.  Here you go. Uh, sorry for the wait.  Hey, can we get another round of beer, too?  - And more fries? Like a butt-load? - Yup.  That'll be just a minute. I'm-I'm by myself right now.  I mean, my wife should be here.  - I have a wife, she's just not here. - She's real, though.  This is making me sound like I don't have a wife. I do.  He does, he definitely does.  - And I do, too. - Teddy, stop it.  Yeah, her name is Karen McGillicuddy.  Oh, God.  (doorbells jingle)  Hi, uh, have a seat.  I'll be right with you.  Where is Linda?  Oh, God help me.  - Eh? Eh? - Teddy, I could actually use a hand.  Yeah! You won't regret this!  You will not regret it! Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!  (laughs) I am in. I am ready.  Give me a thing to put on.  Uh, right?  Oh, here's Linda's, right?  Okay, I'm already regretting this.  But I think you have to take the orders while I make everything.  I will not let you down, Bobby.  Hello, and welcome to Bob's Burgers.  My name's Teddy and I'll be your server today.  Can I start you with some appetizers?  Any dietary restrictions I should know about  - before we get going here? - Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.  - Huh? Too much? - Yes, dial it back.  I'll try.  Any birthdays? Anyone celebrating a birthday?  So you wrote her a note, too?  - Big-time. - What does yours say?  It says, ""How ya doing in there, kiddo?""  But then I scratched out ""kiddo.""  - It felt forced. - Mine's a picture  of that angry hot dog I've been drawing lately.  Zeke, Jimmy Jr., what's the best way  to slide these notes under the door?  Here, let me do it.  (grunts)  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  J-Ju can get them right under the desk.  Well, I've had a lot of practice.  'Cause I have a problem with impulse control. (laughs)  - Ha-cha! - ZEKE: And then I'd read it,  write back, and slide it right under.  And slide it back under.  Huh. Come on!  Yeah, Zeke definitely would've written back by now.  Well, maybe she just didn't see them?  Or maybe she hates us.  She resents us for our freedom.  I told you kids, stay away from that door!  Are we by this door? Oh, we are.  (chuckles) We were just walking.  And we're still walking. Bye.  Mm.  Poor Louise.  Yeah. She must be having the worst day.  (both laugh, sigh)  You're all right, Louise.  I don't care what anyone else says.  Back at ya. This has been fun.  Let's do it again sometime. Can I call you?  I took a magazine from the waiting room.  Did you?  - What? - (screams, tires screech)  - Fine, I'll mail it back to them. - Not that.  (horn honking)  - He's honking at you. - I know, Mother.  - Oh, no, Mr. Frond. - What? Where?  He's right there in his car.  (man humming)  (honking continues)  (gasps) Did he see us?  I don't know, I don't know.  Let's go!  (horn honking)  I got to go.  I got a meeting with the city council !  - Oh, in there. - LOUISE: Yes.  LINDA: Ooh, cotton candy.  - Mom, no, we're hiding! - Right, right, right.  LINDA: Oh, don't come in here,  don't come in here, don't come in here.  Ah, nuts, he came in here.  (groans): Oh.  Where are we going?  I think I saw a truant student,  and I'm not letting her get away.  Oh, a chase. Fun.  Put on the siren.  (imitating siren)  - Mother.  - What?  You want to win a goldfish? Three shots for a dollar.  No. Wait, maybe. No, no, no, thank you.  Oh, boy. This is bad.  I'm gonna get at least a week's suspension.  I know, and if he sees me,  I can kiss the bake sale good-bye.  - Crap, that's right. - Yeah.  You want to just take one look at these goldfish?  They're not all dead.  See, that guy's wiggling a little bit.  He's got some fight in him, huh?  Aw, I love him. Little wiggler.  Frond's coming this way; we got to go in deeper.  (Frond's mom imitating siren)  - Uh, can I get extra jalapeÃ±os on that? - You got it.  Two more Burgers of the Day Extra jalapeÃ±os, buddy!  Shoot. Oh, no, I forget who these go to.  Uh  D-Didn't you write down a table number or anything?  No, no, no, I got my own system.  I associate something with their order,  - and then I make a rhyme out of it. - What?  ""The guy with brown hair wants it medium rare.""  ""The guy with sunglasses wants extra cheese."" Uh  That one doesn't rhyme.  They can't all rhyme! I'm doing all this stuff,  and then I'm trying to come up with these rhymes it's hard.  You can just write down the table numbers, Teddy, or  (grumbles) No, no, uh, it's too late now, Bob. We're in the weeds.  Okay, who had a plain hamburger? Wait, I remember.  ""The guy who wants it plain was kind of a pain."" That's you, sir, right?  No, it's the guy who looks like a weird David Blaine.  Where's he?  GENE: I drew another  angry hot dog. This time, he's at the beach,  - and he's furious at a whale. - I wrote her an inspirational haiku.  ""Hang in there, Louise.  I know it's tough right now, but things are "" Oh, wait, that's not a haiku.  Uh-oh. They put a guard on the door.  I'll try to distract him while you slip the notes under.  Hey, Mr. Branca  - No, no, no, no, no, keep moving. - Damn.  Ms. Schnur had to use the restroom  and told me to watch this door.  No one in, no one out.  Shoot. (growls)  But if two cool kids had notes  or pictures of funny foods,  I might look up here for a second,  and they could slide them under the door without anyone seeing.  Looking up, up, up, up, up  Well, how do we know if that's our situation?  Gene, I think that is our situation.  Did I say ""cool kids""? Let's say slow kids.  - (gasps) That's us! - Could you look up again?  Looking up  - Thanks, Mr. Branca. - I don't know you!  (bell dings)  Whoa, whoa. Uh-oh. Knocked some peppers out.  I'm just gonna poke 'em back in.  No, no, no, no, Teddy, don't poke the food.  Ah, shh, shh, shh. I'm just sticking 'em back in here.  - Get in there, guys. - What are you doing? No, Teddy.  - Get back in there, come on. - I don't even know if  you washed your hands; you shouldn't be touching the food.  Washed my hands? I'm not a surgeon, Bobby.  We only have a few more orders.  Just keep it together for a little bit longer.  God, you are really sweating.  Yeah, I'm dripping a little.  Not in the food. Much.  (yells) My eyes!  - What? What, what? What? - My eyes!  Oh, I got jalapeÃ±o in my eyes!  Where's your emergency eyewash station?  What? We don't have an emergency eyewash station.  Oh, Princess Wash-Your-Hands  doesn't have an emergency eyewash station?!  I can't see, Bob! What am I supposed to do now?  - (yells)  - Just let me take those out.  Ah, no, wait. Bob!  Uh, my other senses are coming up.  Stay on the grill. I can do this.  I'm more alive now than I've ever been before.  - BOB: Oh, boy.  - Who had extra jalapenos?  I can't see you. Use your voice.  I'll remember your voice.  Everyone say something!  Oh, my God.  (Linda and Louise panting)  This is crazy. He's closing in on us.  Can he smell us?  (sniffs) I can. Whew.  LOUISE: And he's between us and the exit.  I mean, we're trapped in here.  Should we just jump into the ocean?  And end it all? Maybe.  No, swim to shore.  Oh. No, gross.  So what should we do?  (groans) I can't believe I got us into this mess.  Yeah, exactly.  This is what I've been saying!  You tried to do something nice for me,  and it bit you in the ass.  You're gonna lose the bake sale.  This is why you shouldn't help people ever!  No! You listen to me.  You're a good person, Louise, and so am I.  And good people do what's right  even if it bites them in the ass.  I mean the you-know-what.  Don't say ""ass,"" say ""bum.""  Listen, here's what we're gonna do:  we're gonna turn ourselves in  and I'm gonna tell him breaking you out of school  was all my idea, and then  maybe you won't get suspension for a week.  But what about the bake sale?  Well, I have other passions  besides planning an amazing bake sale  and laughing in Colleen Caviello's  conventionally attractive face.  Okay, here's another idea.  We split up and I run right at him.  I'll find cover where I can, and I got to get real lucky,  but if I can get past him,  I can get back to school before he does.  What? No. You'll definitely get caught.  No, I'll probably get caught,  but you'll definitely keep that bake sale.  Nope. No. You're not doing that. No.  Sure, sure, I-I know.  I'm just, you know, Spitballing.  Just throwing things out there.  Just trying to solve this predicament.  Oh, Mom, don't panic,  but is that a bee in your boobs?  A bee in my boobs!  Oh, my boobs! Oh, my God!  Oh! Oh, God! Oh. What the ?  That selfless little stinker.  (panting)  Come on, Louise.  Those aren't eagles, they're seagulls.  - FROND'S MOM: What did I say? - (gasps)  Ah! Oh!  I want to get my face painted.  No, no, no.  - We're not here to have fun. - (Louise grunts)  Oh! Oh, my God.  Are you joyless, Phillip?  FROND: Don't start that again, Mother! (Louise gasps)  - Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me! - Oh, boy. Oh, boy.  You never let me get my face painted.  That is just not true.  Yes! Oh, hey, Mr. Frond.  This must be your mother. How are you? I'm Linda.  Hello, Linda.  I had six ingrown toenails.  I heard. That is fascinating.  Linda. Funny seeing you here.  I thought I saw Louise just now.  Louise?  No, she's at in-school suspension,  where I left her.  Huh. What are you doing out here?  Me? I came here, uh,  to get my face painted.  It's, uh, like a cheap facial.  See? She knows how to have fun.  - I do. - Uh-huh.  Mother, we're stopping by the school before I take you home.  - Sorry. - It's okay.  I'm just happy to be outside.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want to talk about the bake sale.  - Uh, I got so many ideas. - No, Linda, no, get  - Get-get off me! - Um  Don't pull on my sleeve.  - No. - What are you doing?  - All right, we can talk on the phone. - O-Okay, yeah, sure.  Okay, here I go! (laughs)  Over to the face paint booth.  - Like I said before. - Uh-huh.  Thanks for coming in, you guys.  Are they still here? Did they leave yet?  Yeah, yeah, they're gone, Teddy.  Still-still can't see anything?  Not really, no. I just see shapes.  But just point me in the direction of a table,  and I will clear it off.  All right, it's okay, Teddy. I got it.  - Do I get to keep the tips? - Yeah.  - Really? - Sure.  I mean, you might have less than you think.  Once you started running around,  blindly slamming into everybody  - Eh. -  knocking them to the ground,  I think they were all  We were really clicking there for a while, huh, pal?  - No. - Yeah?  - No. - We did all right?  - Not really, no. - Pretty good?  - No. Pretty bad. - Yeah.  Eh, we were a real team there, Bobby.  - We were not. - We were doing it.  - We would no. - Oh, we got after it.  - We were at odds. - Yeah.  You know what? As crazy as it sounds,  I could go for a jalapeÃ±o burger right now.  - Hey, for you, coming right up. - TEDDY: All right.  (grunts)  Whoa.  (tires screech)  Wait here. I'll be right back.  Okay, I'll just count the clouds.  One, two  two and a half.  (panting): Is Louise still in there?  She hasn't left all day.  I'm gonna check.  Okay, I'll sit right here while you do that.  Good luck to both of us.  TINA: Hey, Mr. Frond. We're here for Louise.  GENE: She's done her time, man. We need to reintroduce her  into society, get her used to life  on the outside.  Well, I'm here for Louise, too.  But she's not gonna be here for us when I open this door!  What? Louise. You're here.  Of course. (coughs) Where else would I be?  Why are you sweaty and winded?  Um, because it's hot in here?  Where's the air conditioner?  Yeah, where that's what I want to know.  Well, where's your essay? Let's see it.  Um  right here, where I keep my essays.  Hey, that's the notes we've been  - Uh, Gene. (chuckles) - Um  Ha! Just a kid yelling.  (laughs nervously)  It's a lot of drawings of an angry hot dog  and a poorly formed haiku?  - That seems harsh. Just saying. - I don't get it.  Well, the angry hot dog represents who I am, in here,  and then the haiku represents who I want to be, out there.  But if you don't get it  (scoffs) I-I get it.  I just thought it might have a-a meaning beyond  - the obvious meaning. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.  Louise! (panting)  Oh, good, you made it. Through the day.  Oh, and my little Teeny and Geeny  are here to visit their jailbird sister.  No matter what she does, we'll always love her.  Want to talk about the face?  What's there to talk about?  I'm a cat. Meow.  I love this woman!  Hello again, Mr. Frond. Is Louise free to go?  Uh, she seems to have satisfied the requirements, so, yes.  Louise, did we learn our lesson today?  We sure did, Mom.  Wait. What was that? Did you just wink at each other?  Yeah, cats wink.  And some people wink at their cat moms.  And other people leave their moms in cars  on hot days with all the windows rolled up.  Oh, my God! Mother!  TEDDY:  I've had   The time of my life   No, I never felt this way before   Yes, I swear it's the truth   And I owe it all to you   I've had   The time of my life   And I've searched through every open door   Till I've found   Found the truth, and I"
"1    (blows nose) Sick? What?  (chuckles) I mean, barely.  It's nothing. It's really nothing.  (hacking) Achoo! (all groan)  Oh, God.  I-I just don't think it's a good idea for you to go tonight.  And miss the kids' ""Mother's Day Assembly"" at school? No way.  You mean ""Mothers and Primary Caregivers  Appreciation Cabaret.""  Lin, nobody would be able to hear the performance  over your constant coughing.  Plus you'd get everyone sick  since you're terrible at covering your sneezes.  - Achoo! - Ugh.  - Ugh. - That was all over me. Ugh.  Silly me without my poncho.  Lin, what if I record the performance for you?  It's not the same thing.  Whoa, is that the flux capacitor?  Does that transform into anything?  No, but it records just fine.  Yeah, people are fools for using a higher quality machine  - that also fits in their pocket. - LINDA: But, Bob,  - you're a terrible cameraman. - What?!  You're too worried about blocking people's view.  A school function is not the place to be polite.  Okay, I'll be more rude.  Good. And I don't want to hear you  breathing into the mic either.  It's like there's always a monster just off screen.  Don't breathe. Got it.  It'll be like you were there, Lin.  - You promise? - Promise.  All right, we got to go.  Everyone lift the camera on the count of three.  One, two  (kids groaning)  Welcome.  In honor of Mother's Day on Sunday,  each of our grades will wow you with a song  or dazzle you with a skit.  Mothers and mother-like caregivers,  prepare to be appreciated.  (quietly): Oh, God, squatting is so hard.  And now, our fourth graders will take you back  to the Old West, with ""Mom on the Range!""  (piano plays)  (camcorder beeps) ""End of tape""?  No, no, no, no, no. Rewind faster.  KIDS (off-key):  Mom, Mom on the range   Where the dear and the mom-elope play   All rewound.  And here we go.  The end!   Oh, crap, it's over.  Okay, at least I can get Gene and Tina's.  Two out of three. Not terrible.  Our sixth graders have been studying myths.  Put your hands together for them,  they're mythological and mytho-lovable,   the sixth grade!  - (camcorder beeps) - BOB: ""Battery dead""?  No, no, no.  Oh, I have the cord.  I just need an outlet.  Excuse me, excuse me.  KIDS:  Our lives are eternal   Are eternal   Dang it.  KIDS:  Your love is maternal   Maternal   Ugh!  KIDS:  That's gods for ya   BOB: All right.  The end   GENE:  The end.   Damn it. Oh. Okay, I can still get Tina.  One is something, right?  And now, your favorite space cadets,  the eighth graders!    All right, all right, here we, here we go.  - ZEKE: Moms are very special people. - (tape whirs)   No, no, no, no, no.  JIMMY JR.: That's why they're called moms.  Don't you die on me, camera.  I guess you could say  I guess Tina could say  It's your line, girl.  Oh. Moms are out of this world.  And step-moms, right, Cheryl?  - Love you, girl! - CHERYL: Whoo!  - (whimpers) - Dad, we have to go inside  at some point, that's our home.  Plus, maybe it's okay that Mom that will never see that.  - 'Cause it was awful. - It was crap.  Hey, maybe she won't be that mad.  What?! You didn't record it?!  (sobbing loudly)  - Oh, boy. - Nothing?!  My babies!  I'm so sorry, Lin.  It's gone, it's all gone forever.  - Choo! - All over me.  I mean, maybe you kids could kind of describe  the performance a little  for your mom. That might help Dad.  Me, I'm your dad.  (sighs) All right, tell me your performances.  Just like they happened.  (blows loudly)  Let me just get this last little bit out.  (blowing loudly)  (whispering): Hey, guys.  We don't have to tell it exactly as it happened.  Right. Because that would be depressing for her.  Yeah, I mean, we could goose the performances a little bit.  Uh, yeah, yeah, do that.  Yeah. Let's give Mom a real show.  She deserves a good Mother's Day present.  Also, will you go before me?  I don't know what ""goose the performances"" means.  (blows loudly)  Okay. (blows) Ugh, there she is.  Uh, Mother, I'll go first.  My class did a Western.  It was pretty gritty, pretty raw.  It was called  - ""The Town with No Moms."" - Oh.  LOUISE: The set design was real impressive.  I mean, a bunch of kids stayed late to do it.  LINDA: Okay, all right.  - LOUISE: It had been a normal old - (glass shattering)  western town till Meanie McQueen came in, breaking glass and kicking ass.  Which was bad for the sheriff.  Once again, I'm gonna ask you nicely to stop doing that.  - Let me think about it. - (glass shatters)  - Nope. - Well, thanks for considering it.  I do like your choice in jewelry.  I bet it'd look mighty good on me.  - Give me it. - I'd rather not.  Give me your badge, Sheriff!  No, I don't want to!  Ha! Now she's the sheriff!  (Linda gasps)  LOUISE: The moms of the town tried to stand up to Meanie,  so Meanie and her goons locked them all up.  Hence the title of the play. ""The Town with No Moms.""  Ah. Okay, yeah.  The sheriff knew he couldn't handle  Meanie McQueen on his own.  He needed help  from the roughest, toughest,  cactus kicker he ever knew.  - Mom? - Hello, son.  - What you knitting? - Spurs.  I need your help.  I'm sure you do, but you never write,  you never call, you're critical of my life choices.  You were a bad guy, Mom, an outlaw.  What, are you still mad about me not going  to your sheriff graduation?  Is that what this is about?  I told you 100 times, I had business!  - You were in jail! - In jail on business!  Lies!  Plus, I tried to break out, okay?  Gosh.  Anyway, what brings you back home?  Well, a no-good meanie named Meanie McQueen  took my badge and keys and threw all the moms  in my town in jail.  Now it's a town with no moms.  Did you tell them in your big sheriff voice  that you didn't like it when they threw all the moms in jail?  I think so.  Well, then, sounds like you need a little help.  Let's do this.    Guess what, Meanie McQueen?  I told my mom on you.  Aw. The mom of the sheriff is an ex-outlaw.  I love it.  And you're telling the story so well. Achoo!  And back to the story. We're gonna get sick.  The sheriff and his tough mom toughly walked in, looking tough.  Aw, you brought your mommy.  That's right. Did I stutter?  Because sometimes I stutter,  but I feel like I got that out pretty clearly.  Ask the jailhouse full of moms if I'm scared of moms.  And then ask them if they like mom jeans  that were invented recently.  Listen, I don't like the way you're treating my boy.  And you're gonna knock it off.  Let me tell you what I'm gonna knock off.  I'm gonna knock off this glass.  - Oh, dear. - (Andy and Ollie whimper)  And then I'm gonna knock that attitude  right off of your face.  Ha. I'd like to see you try.  Taking care of you is gonna be a snap.  (pops mouth)  That sounds like a stretch.  Whoa, this is getting tense.  (deep, wheezing breath)  Rubber bands? What's with the rubber bands?  What's wrong with rubber bands?  Nothing. Go on.  LOUISE: They faced off, face-to-face.  I'm gonna give you till the count of three  to get out of town on your own.  And I'm not gonna do that thing where I fling my rubber band  after I only count to one.  Oh, my gosh, that's super nice of you.  - Okay, then, one - I'm doing that thing!  - Ugh! - Get 'em!  (rubber bands bouncing)  (panting): What do we do?  They got us pinned down.  Son, I'm like a starched collar.  I'm never pinned down.  Ow! I'm hit!  (groaning in pain)  Fling! Fling! Fling! Fling! Fling! Ow! Move it!  - Go, go, go, go, go! Go! - (Rudy panting)  You got the angle, son.  Here it goes.  Ow!  My beautiful knee!  (screams, then grunts)  Is it safe for a kid to fall off  a second-floor balcony like that?  It's fine. Millie trained for weeks for that fall.  Yeah, she's Jessica Alba's stunt double.  RUDY: All right, Meanie. We've got you outnumbered.  - Okay, I give up! - Really?  Yeah, I know when I'm beat.  Just gonna get a quick sarsaparilla for the road.  Make it real quick.  Oh, I will.  Fling!  Ow!  You jerks. (crying)  Hey, can I get my badge and key back?  Uh, thank you.  Mom, you got Meanie.  You fought my battles for me.  (gasps) Mom?  Mom?  No!  She got me, Rudy.  She got me right in the gut.  But  I think this is it for me.  But, no.  Damn these rubber bands.  Damn them to hell!  What will I do without you?  Oh, Rudy.  You'll live.  'Cause I raised you to live.  (crying)  Always remember how great your mom was.  And always remember to breathe harder than others.  Adios, much  (wheezing):  chacho.  She's got asthma, too.  (crying)  (deep, wheezing breath)  (coughing and crying)  LOUISE: The town with no moms was gonna have to go by a different name.  Because of one mom, who saved all the moms,  they named it Momtown.  (sneezes)  Momtown.  What a tearjerker.  I know. You can see why I haven't  been doing my homework lately.  I've been so focused on that play.  It was very impressive to see, in person.  Yeah. (whistles)  Mm-hmm. (whistles)  Tina, what'd your class do?  Um, it's all so fresh, I'm still kind of remembering what we did.  But Gene's got that ""Let me go next"" face.  Do I?  You definitely do, Gene.  We did kind of a skit song with xylophones and clouds.  It was called ""Eternally Maternal.""  Ooh, a skit song.  I was completely in sync with everyone else,  in case you were wondering.  Ah. Sure.  GENE: I played a god named Yingo.  My brothers Yango and Yongo and I  created the universe and everything in it.  We made clouds, TV, breadsticks,  unlimited breadsticks.  We had it good, real good.  Hey, check out what I made with the Staff of Creation.  A banana-ffalo.  It's half banana, half buffalo.  Wait, what mythology is this?  Uh, it's kind of a mishmash.  Greek, Roman, PokÃ©mon, Tex-Mex, you know.  Sure, sure.  Anyway.  Boy, do we have it good, except  Sometimes I feel really under-snuggled   Under-snuggled   What if we could be snuggled often   By someone that's really soft and   - Gentle? - Gentle?  We could call her Mombo.  Or Mom for short?  And she could kiss our god-ouchies all better   Ooh   And she'd smell just like you remember   Yeah   And stop us from watching too much TV   - Huh? - Wait, what?  Yeah. We need, uh, healthy limits.  Hey, uh, Yingo. Let me see that Staff of Creation real quick. No reason.  Oh, okay, sure.  Ha, ha, ha! You're never creating a mom.  Hey, give it back.  No. (grunts)  GENE: And they played Keep Away over the audience  and people went crazy.  I'm throwing this across the universe.  (grunts) No!  LINDA: Oh, that Yango and Yongo.  Why don't they want a mom?  - Little punks. - I know.  Yingo's pretty great, though, right?  Gene, go on with your incredibly accurate accounting  of what happened earlier tonight.  I will. There I was,  searching the universe for the Staff of Creation.  Ugh! Why did I have to make the universe so huge?  I can't find anything.  I want that staff.  I want to have someone like a mom.  COURTNEY: You mean like me?  (angelic voices sing)  Wait, how'd you create her without the Staff of Creation?  I didn't. She's a vision.  Ooh, vision.  But if I was real,  here's what I might be like.  I'd live on a diet of wine and cheese   You'd teach me to say thank you and also please   Manners are important. (laughs)  If you don't have a date, I'll go with you to prom   Oh, I sure would like to have someone like a mom   I'd do your homework when you don't wanna   You'd let me get a big iguana   As long as you take care of it   I'll make you watch all my favorite Rom-come   BOTH:  Oh, I sure would like   -  To have someone like a mom  -  To be somebody's mom.   Mombo, you're fading.  Because I'm not real.  I'm just a vision.  (quietly): Vision, vision.  I need that Staff of Creation!  You don't need the staff.  You just need to believe.  If you believe,  put your hand under your armpit and squeeze.  (fart noise)  It makes a funny sound.  That's the sound of believing.  Everyone, believe with me.  (fart noises)  (thunder crashes)  There was thunder and lightning  and crashing cymbals.  And steel drums, I want to say.  And Mombo became real.  And everyone was dancing on the ceiling,  and this was way before Lionel Richie.  I'm real.  This is amazing.  I'm so much better than a dad.  What's a dad?  Oh, let me tell you about dads.  They're hairy, they've got no rhythm,  they can't tape a school play to save their lives,  they smell weird, their knees are backwards  Okay, Gene, we get it.  (humming)  Oh, that's catchy.  And the production sounds impressive.  All those wires.  Yeah, that's the crew kids.  They don't want speaking roles.  They express themselves through pulleys.  Okay, I think I'm ready to remember what my class did.  Ooh, all right. (retches)  We did a little play called ""Moms Are out of This World"".  It took place out of this world.  TINA: I played a tough lady named Sigourney,  with a complicated backstory and a great jumpsuit.  I was on a mission with a couple spunky space marines  to wipe out an incredibly dangerous alien species  that had a thing for jumping out of people's chests.  - LINDA: Yuck. - TINA: I know, right?  In order to exterminate the aliens, we have to take out their queen.  Which won't be easy.  Yeah, it will, 'cause we got the guts.  And we got the tools. Ha! Come on.  Yeah, take that, alien.  We'll need to be careful and brave,  because this alien is super tough.  It's got acid for blood,  so it can hurt you even after you've killed it.  - Which is annoying. - Like stepping on a dead bee.  Y'all ever done that? One time  TINA: But before they entered into the fight of their lives,  they had to do something real quick.   that stinger's about four inches long.  We could trip over these space crates.  I'd better move 'em.  Let me just strap into this super strong,  robotic exoskeleton loader.  Hold on a second.  Uh, yeah, sure.  TINA: Maybe this will come back later. Who knows?  LINDA: Robotic loader?  Flamethrowers?  What kind of budget did you have for these plays?  Mmm. I think it was about $50,000.  - They fired a gym teacher. - And we had a bake sale.  Okay. Let's get this mother.  Oh.  Also, I forgot to tell you.  There are reports of scientific anomalies on this planet.  - A-Anomalies? - Yeah. Scientific ones.  Because of the, uh,  terraforming station.  And the hyper unit something.  Uh, all right.  What are these things? Space tulips?  Negative. Those are pods.  With alien babies in 'em.  We have to take out the alien queen mom,  if we can figure out where she is.  - Uh - Oh, there she is.  (screams)  Game over, man. Game over.  (Zeke grunts)  TINA: This was a big moment  when we revealed the alien queen costume/puppet.  There were a lot of kids working behind the scenes  to make this thing look like an egg-laying monster.  Some parents screamed.  One lady fainted.  Dad, talking about you.  Damn it! How am I supposed to kill you  when these trained space marines couldn't?  - You're so strong. - Whatever.  How am I supposed to not be killed by you  with your flamethrower and your advanced technology?  You're so smart.  What? That's crazy.  You're the perfect organism.  Ugh. You have it so much easier than me.  Nuh-uh.  I have slimy hands and two weird mouths.  Your hands are only a little slimy  and you came here on a spaceship.  You have it easier than me.  BOTH: I wish I could be you for a day.  TINA: And then we switched bodies.  I mean, you know, we switched costumes.  But the idea was, we switched bodies.  We body-switched!  (gasps) The anomaly.  Wait, what?  The scientific anomaly.  Because of the terraforming  - hyper unit something. - Whatever.  Hey, check out my hair when I run.  Ah.  I thought this was Alien.  Now it's a body-switching story?  It's Freaky Friday-liens.  I remember all of this.  Me, too. But, uh, what happens again?  Tina, go on, go on.  TINA: I was the queen, and I decided to take  my new body out for a spin.  I jumped. I whipped my tail around.  I climbed a wall.  The big three.  Ah.  Super cool.  (alien baby cries)  Huh? Oh, a baby. Right.  I'm totally a mom.  Aw, look at you.  You probably want a host body to suck the life out of.  (shushing)  Don't shush me. (continues crying)  Okay. I'm going to put you back  - in your egg-a-majig. - (babies crying)  Oh, more babies. I have so many babies.  (groaning): I don't know how to take care of all these babies.  Ah Mommy's gonna be back in just a sec.  - Man, that alien sure was tough. - I know.  - And so totally smoking hot. - Do what?  Yeah, I wouldn't say it was hot.  I mean, it wasn't ugly, but  Yeah, it was ugly. It was a monster.  That seems closed-minded.  Sigourney, you're acting weird.  Weird like cool weird?  Like I just got a lot cooler recently?  Um  Psst.  (whispering): Can I talk with you real quick?  Ugh. Back in a sec, guys.  I just got to go, um, stretch my human legs out.  I'll be right back.  - I want to switch back. - What? Already?  No way.  Come on. It's hard being in your body.  I'm loving being in your body.  It's so much more compact.  And I love these eye guards.  - I feel like they make me look smart. - Uh-huh, but  And human boys, I love them.  They have so few teeth. It's cute.  Listen, we got to say ""I want to switch back"" at the same time,  so the scientific anomaly can happen.  Ready? And  - I want to switch back. - I'm not switching back.  (sighs) I was afraid of this.  Um, I'm gonna have to force you to switch back  with my alien strength.  - (growls) - Ow.  TINA: And then it was a full-on battle  with that loader you might remember from before.  How do you even use this thing?  Um, you just hold onto the  - Never mind, I got it. - Okay, good.  (grunting)  TINA: So we were fighting. And the audience  was really into it, and they weren't just being nice  'cause it was a school play. Right, Dad?  It was it was  It was like Avenue Q meets Caligula  meets a fight outside of a Dairy Queen.  Yes. Right. E-Exactly.  - Wait, you saw Caligula? - You saw Caligula?  Wait, what's Caligula?  Come on, I don't want to hurt you.  - Switch back. - No.  (grunts)  (growls)  I'm never changing back.  (alien babies cry)  - Sweeties? - (alien babies cry)  Aw. They need me.  (sighs) Okay, let's switch back.  Oh, phew.  But after we switch back,  my babies will need a host body  to feed off of as a life source.  Will you be that host body?  Um, maybe?  I mean, after we switch. Let's switch first.  Okay.  One, two, three  BOTH: I want to switch back.  - Come here, alien babies. - (babies crying)  Come to mama.  - Ow. - Okay, bye.  I'll get back to you about that host body thing.  Everyone lived happily ever after.  Then the crew kids struck the set real fast and that was that.  So, wow.  There you have it, Lin.  Pretty much how it went at school.  You mean exactly much.  Oh, my God. I can't believe I missed it.  If I was as strong as those mothers in your stories,  I would have gone and just sneezed all over  everyone's dumb faces.  What? Mom, you are the mothers in those stories.  - I am? - Yeah.  You would take a rubber band to the gut for us.  You stand up for us all the time.  Well, yeah, I guess.  And you're not a god, but you're god-like.  That's true.  And you're a badass protective queen bee alien  with acid for blood, right?  Kinda, yeah, maybe.  And you'd forgive your husband  for messing up on some videotaping.  - Geez, Dad. Got to weasel in, huh? - Trying.  Get in here. Mother's Day weekend hug.  I don't think we should be touching.  (phone buzzes)  Hey. The school just sent a link  to a recording of the performance.  Oh. Um  Should we watch it?  KIDS: Uh  You know what? I don't want to watch it.  I already know I like your version better.  Got to say, this was a pretty great Mother's Day gift.  What else did you get me?  KIDS AND BOB: Uh  LINDA:  Oh, what a feeling   When we're dancing on the ceiling   Oh, what a feeling   We're dancing on the ceiling   What is happening here?   Something's going on that's not quite clear   Somebody turn on the light   We're gonna have a party   It's starting tonight.   (laughs)  Everyone's upside-down. The blood's rushing to my head."
"1    All right, kids, out of the booth.  Time to get ready for the lunch rush.  Which is probably coming.  Any minute now.  It is kind of a slow start to lunch today, huh?  Yeah, it hasn't really been a great month.  For your B.O.?  No. For the restaurant.  Because of your B.O.?  No. I think people  are just eating other food this month.  - (door bell jingles) - TEDDY: Bob?  (panting): Bob, tomorrow's Bog to Beach!  - What? - Bog to Beach!  The parade. It's tomorrow!  - Oh, okay. - Oh, I love Bog to Beach!  All the free spirits out on the streets  having a blast.  Well, it turns out my neighbor  is friends with the owner of The Bear Trap.  You know, the bar?  By the beach? Near the clam shack?  No, but that's okay that I don't.  Well, he always does a parade float in the Bog to Beach.  (grunts) But this year he's not doing one  'cause he hurt his back at the Strongman Invitationals.  So his float is available,  and his slot in the parade is available, too!  Uh, I'm still not sure why you're yelling at us, Teddy.  Also, you're really out of breath.  (panting): Yeah. I ran all the way over here.  I'm telling you this 'cause he said you could make his float  into a Bob Burgers float.  ""Bob's Burgers,"" but whatever.  (gasp) Our own parade float?  Are you kidding me?  I've always wanted to be in Bog to Beach.  Dress up crazy and dance all crazy.  Whip my hair around all crazy!  Whoo! Get it, girl. Ah!  Uh, I don't know if I want to do  a parade float for Bog to Beach.  It doesn't seem that fun.  Of course it sounds fun. It's a parade.  You start at the bog and you end up at the beach.  You drink a lot, you wear crazy costumes.  Oh, I love it.  And some people don't wear costumes.  Or anything.  Sun's out, buns out. Am I right?  But it gets a little out of control.  - (loud music) - (yelling)  Plus, I don't really get it. People pee everywhere, and it smells and  You had me at ""pee everywhere."" I'm in.  Dad, maybe you just don't like to let loose and have fun.  You're a little grumpy and super lumpy.  That's your jam.  I like fun I mean, working here is fun, right?  - Ooh, a customer. Oh, no, never mind. - So fun.  Come on! Let's close the restaurant  for a few hours tomorrow and ride around on a parade float!  Please?  Bob, I didn't even get to the good part.  There's a cash prize for the top five floats,  and there's only four floats in the parade this year.  There's a cash prize?  - Cash is the best kind of money. - There weren't a lot of sign-ups  because the weather's supposed to be bad.  (sighs) I don't know. Could we make a float in one night?  Of course. I'll pick it up and bring it here.  You just gotta decorate it a little  and drive it down the parade route.  Fifth place gets $500.  So, we get $500 even if we come in last place?  - Yep. - We can do that.  We're great at that.  Last place. Last place!  Last place! Last place!  What do you say, Bob?  I mean, $500 sounds nice.  That's more than we'd make serving lunch.  Uh, all right. Let-let's do it.  OTHERS: Yay!  - All right! - Ooh, I'm so excited!  Great! We're doing this!  I'll go pick up the float and drive it back here.  Uh, Teddy, I could give you a ride,  and, oh, and he's running down the street.  Huh, I wonder if we should hand out  free samples on the parade route?  Of what? Ooh, sesame chicken!  No. Burgers, Gene. Drum up a little business.  I'm gonna think about costumes.  Bob, you go to Reflections  and buy some decorations for the float.  Don't be afraid of sequins, Dad!  They're more scared of you than you are of them.    - (door bell jingles) - What do you want, flapjacks?  - We're closing. - Hi, I just need a few things.  I-I'm decorating a float,  and I'm really not sure what to buy.  Well, you have one minute, and then we're locking the door.  Oh, okay, fine. Just tell me what to get.  - Petal paper. - Excuse me?  Petal paper!  I-I don't know what that is.  Floral sheeting.  It's called petal paper. Buy some!  Okay, okay, okay.  - 30 more seconds. - Come on.  Deco-puff pomps!  - Wh-What? - Puff pomps!  - What ? - The clock's ticking.  I just don't know what that is.  Oh, you're out of your league, tubs.  (sighs) What else do I need?  Float festoon.  - Wait, what? - Festoon!  Open your ears!  They're garlands! Get 'em and get out!  - Fringe. - He's out of time.  - He needs fringe. - Buy the damn fringe!  - Where is it? - That's fringe!  - That's fringe! Pick it up! - I got it!  Put it in the thing! Bring it to the counter!  - Here, here, here. - $65.  Seriously? That a lot for different forms of tissue paper.  - You need it. - See you on the parade route, newbie.  Your float's gonna look like a lousy joke next to ours.  Wait, you guys have a float in the parade?  Yeah, and we get our fringe wholesale.  Yeah, instead of at a 1,000% mark-up.  - Sucker. - What?  We're out of bags. Pick it up!  - (groans) - Get him out of here, Harold.  I'm sick of looking at his face.  Look at our float! I love our float!  I can't believe we actually get to ride up there.  Usually parade floats are for beauty pageant winners  and dogs that have been in movies.  Where's Teddy? Who's driving this thing?  Ghost float!  Pretty sweet, right?  And look what else I borrowed from The Bear Trap.  Ba Ba-da-da!  T-shirt cannons.  - Yeah! Nice. - Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!  We don't have T-shirts to shoot, Teddy.  You must have a couple of old shirts upstairs, Bob.  You could write ""Bob Burgers"" on 'em real quick. Right?  It's ""Bob's Burgers.""  So what are we doing for costumes, Mom?  Here's the plan Gene's gonna wear the burger costume,  and I'm gonna use old bed sheets to make a ketchup bottle,  a mustard bottle and a pickle.  (chuckles) And I'm gonna make something amazing for myself  that I haven't thought of yet.  A crumpled napkin?  Ooh! What if we do a dance?  (gasp) We could lip-sync!  GENE: Mm-hmm.  Yeah. We bring the boom box,  and we play ""Hot Pants Rain Dance.""  You know that song?  'Cause it's supposed to rain tomorrow, right?  The float has speakers. You could crank it.  It starts off slow, and then it builds  into the best disco song about rain ever.  Three words for you, Mother: ""It's Raining Men.""  Fine, second best.  Sure, I mean, maybe we could play a song,  but let's not spend a lot of time on this.  I say we just cover our float with expensive tissue paper  and call it a night.  (sighs) Great. Jimmy's coming over here.  Hey, Bob.  I don't even want to know what that is.  (chuckles) But, uh, tell me.  It's a float, Jimmy. For Bog to Beach.  Ugh! Bog to Beach is the worst!  Bunch of artsy-fartsy weirdoes  throwing paper cups all over the place and making  a strange You know what I'm saying.  We're doing it for the cash prize,  so there, Jimmy.  And to celebrate the freaks that weave the fabric  of this funky town.  More the money. And we're gonna hand out  free samples, drum up a little business.  Probably a lot of business. So, yeah.  Yeah, giving away food is great business, Bob.  And hey, your float looks dumb, just like your face.  (laughs) And also,  you have another restaurant's name on it, so good luck.  Can I shoot him, Dad? Can I shoot him?  No. Maybe. Yes, definitely.  - Gene, give me some ammunition. - Coming right up.  - (Gene grunting) - And  Don't don't do it. Stand stand down, stand down.  Fine, standing down.  Huh. I know they said it's supposed to rain tomorrow,  but it's really nice out; maybe it won't rain.  (thunder rumbling)  Oh my God, it's raining.  It's raining so much.  These costumes are like sponges.  I lined the inside of them with sponges.  Oh  Yeah, Linda, the costumes are great.  - Aw, thanks. - But why are we all pickles?  I made the first pickle, and it turned out so good  I just kept going.  It looks like maybe we own a pickle restaurant.  Someone should have checked on me.  I was up there all alone, just making pickles.  (sighs) Well, at least we're here.  Let's just drive the parade route,  get this float in front of the judges,  and come in last place.  GENE: The Belcher way.  JIMMY: Honk-honk!  Hey, Bob! Horn doesn't work. Check this out, huh?  This is what a float looks like.  No, no, no, no!  Now there are six floats and there's only five prizes.  We're gonna have to beat Jimmy.  There goes our whole strategy.  Looks like we're in a bit of a pickle.  'Cause we're You get it.  - Why are you doing this, Jimmy? - Hey, hey,  what do you mean? I love this parade.  No, you don't!  Anyway, I do everything better than you.  So, you're gonna lose.  - Ooh, yeah! - Your float stinks, Jimmy.  And you're not gonna beat us.  Yes, I am. I brought just a ton of free pizzas to hand out.  Drum up a little business.  You could learn a lot from me, Bob.  That was my idea.  Sorry, I can't hear you over how good my float is.  (chuckles)  GENE: I don't know where to look first.  It's a freak-peeping bonanza.  Oh, look! It's a naked juggler.  So many balls in the air.  Hey, Marshmallow's here. Hi, girl!  Hi, girl, yourself, you little Bog to Beach baby.  All right, it's time to start the parade, everybody!  Let's go!    Hey, Bobby. You're gonna have to tell me where to steer.  This thing does not have windshield wipers.  I got nothing down there.  We gotta use the walkie-talkies.  TEDDY (over walkie): Hey, Bob. It's Teddy, from before.  Yup.  It's, uh you get kind of lonely down here.  You just went down there, Teddy.  I just wish I was up there with you guys.  I'm coming up!  Teddy, no. It's our turn to go.  So go, and drive straight.  TEDDY. All right. And we're floatin'!  Aah!  Who wants a free T-shirt?  It's coming out of the cannon Look alive!  Where were you?  Hey, who wants a free burger?  It's coming out of a boy!  Five second rule. That's not a problem. It's fine.  Time to unleash the beast.  Here comes my parade wave.  Wipe that blackboard, wipe that blackboard,  kiss your hand, and wipe that blackboard.  Hey, Gretchen. You having fun?  Hey, Linda. I've been having fun since yesterday.  I got the date for the parade wrong,  so I've just been out here.  Bye! What are you supposed to be?  I'm a permaid. A mermaid with a perm.  Yeah, you are. Look at you.  Uh, hi, hey! Who wants some pizza?  Lady, hey, come here, take a slice, go on.  Stupid Jimmy Pesto!  So, Dad, are you loving this or what?  (growls)  You know what would cheer up an old crank like you?  - Lip-syncing to some disco. - Fact.  I gave Teddy the cassette for ""Hot Pants Rain Dance.""  I am not an old crank.  I just don't want to pretend to sing that song right now.  - (engine revs) - What the hell is he doing?  LINDA: Hey, back off, Jimmy, we're parading here.  I'm sick of looking at your ugly float.  I'm gonna pass you.  What? You can't pass in a parade, Jimmy.  Get your dumb float away from us.  Hey! You see these pizzas?  Now I'm gonna finish the parade before you  and bribe the judges with them. (laughs)  What? No! No! You're not, Jimmy.  Because I am not letting you pass us!  I'm gonna kick your float.  I can almost reach it.  Hey, don't kick my float. I'm gonna kick your float.  - Hey! - Hey!  Oh, hey, looks a little loose right here, huh?  Hey, it came right off in my hand.  You can't do that!  Yeah, get your damn hands off her, Biff!  Hey, what's going on with this one?  It's just coming off all by itself.  Oopsie-oopsie!  BOB: No! Our sign!  Ooh! The judges are definitely gonna take points off for that.  Get back, Jimmy, or I'll shoot.  Aw, come on, you don't have it in Oof!  Oh! Free shirt, though.  Ha! Kids, arm your T-shirt guns.  Keep Jimmy away from our float.  GENE: Say hello to my 50-50 blend.  You shoot a T-shirt at a guy like a girl!  (groans)  So, like that?  Oh, his face!  Good shot, Louise.  Hey. Hey.  Some, ha, crazy float drama going on up there, huh?  Yeah, why can't we all just enjoy the day?  I know, right?  Let's promise to never get caught up in that mess.  Totally.  Jimmy Jr., quick, grab that fluttery thing.  - What, this? - What the hell? I'll kill you!  (gasping): Tina!  Oh, my God. What have we become?  Hey, it's the Belchers!  We know them!  Wait, no, those are pickles.  Hi, pickles!  - Damn it. - It doesn't look that bad.  Yeah, it's distressed.  - (groans) - GENE: Shabby chic.  Flabby chic.  Bob, don't let Pesto poop on our parade.  Bye, Bob. I'm gonna go give pizza to the judges.  Then we'll laugh about how stupid hamburgers are. (laughs)  Ah! We can't let Jimmy finish first.  Why not?  You know what no one has ever wanted  after a bunch of free pizza?  A bunch of free burgers!  Don't speak for me!  Wait. I know how we can get back in front of Pesto.  Bob, it's not a race.  That's right, it's a not a race, Lin.  It's a war.  - It's a race war. - Gene  Bob, it's a parade.  We're having fun, remember?  No, Lin, Pesto ruined our float.  It looks worse than his now.  He's gonna beat us and get the $500,  unless we go to the judges first,  and give them our burgers before he gives them his stupid pizza.  - (static crackles) - Teddy?  Bob? Is that you?  Yes, it's me, Teddy. Who else would it be?  It's just good to hear a human voice.  Teddy, listen, I need you to make a left.  What?  We're gonna go left here on this little side street,  and then we're gonna go right,  and then right again,  and we'll rejoin the parade route,  and we'll be in front of all the floats!  You got it. Going off the parade route.  Sounds like a good idea, Bob.  I miss you. I miss all of you.  - BOB: Sorry, pardon us. - TINA: Coming through.  GENE: Watch your hula-hoop, sir.  - Look out! - Heads up!  LINDA: See you soon, parade. Stay funky.  Now we just make a right. Teddy, turn right here.  Turning right.  BOB: We'll go down the block.  Teddy, give it a little more gas.  Now we'll just make the next right,  and we're back on the route.  There are no rights.  BOB: Oh, no, the street's curving left.  Teddy? Are you seeing this?  We're gonna have to veer left.  Veering left.  Bob! Mayday! Mayday!  We gotta stop and we gotta turn around  and go back the way we came.  We gotta get back on route.  No way, Linda. There's no turning around.  I mean, literally.  I don't think this can turn around.  We stay the course, there's gotta be a right somewhere.  We're lost, Bob. Who gets lost on a float?  Dad did.  Oh, was that not a real question?  Dad, can I shoot you in the neck with a T-shirt?  No, you cannot shoot me in (gasps)  TINA: I mean, one float can be a parade, right?  If there's anyone else on the street,  I'm sure they'd appreciate this.  There's a guy going to the bathroom  between two parked cars.  Yeah! He's got the spirit.  Oh, it's the mayor. Hi, Mayor!  Oh, it Oh, oh, that's not the mayor.  There's a right. Finally.  Teddy, turn right.  (all groan)  Hey, it looks like we're part of some  other kind of parade, I think.  Oh yeah, we're in a parade of town cars.  And there's Mort's car up front.  LINDA: Bob, we're in a funeral procession.  BOB: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What do we do?  LOUISE: Hey, they probably won't even notice us.  Worst case scenario, we follow this death parade  all the way to a pretty sweet deli spread.  Oh! Another right!  I think we should do it.  - Teddy, turn right again. - TEDDY: Turning.  LINDA: Oh, God, the funeral's turning!  GENE: No! Don't follow us! Don't follow us!  LOUISE: Well, we finally lost them.  LINDA: They'll find another funeral.  I'm feeling good about this.  I think we're minutes away from finding the parade.  Aw Oh, come on. Oh!  Oh, great. He's blocking the street.  Hey, Teddy? We got to stop.  - LINDA: Hi! You okay? - Uh  Uh, first day.  - Us, too. - Want a free shirt?  Uh, sure.  (groans) Thanks!  No problem!  Uh, do you need help?  - We have to use the road. - Maybe.  - Oh, okay, you go up. - No, Lin, you go up.  - No, you go up. - No, I'm going  - I'll go under. Going under. - BOB: Lift it up.  LINDA: I'll go under. I'm just going to stand in one place.  - GENE: Mine smells funny. - Your what?  GENE: Ugh! We're missing it!  People are just traipsing around  in provocative hand-crafted costumes, and we're lost!  I think we're close.  I really think we're almost back on route.  I'm sick of your lies, Dad!  Sorry, sorry, I just got hot for a second.  Mostly I'm really cold and wet.  - (faint cheering, drums beating) - Wait, wait, did you guys hear that?  - GENE: Did you fart? - No. Yes, but it was silent.  (gasp) I think it's the parade!  It's definitely a parade.  Oh, my God, I hear it, too.  LINDA: Look! Up there to the right.  Freaky parade people!  Butts! I see butts!  Teddy, we've got a right turn coming up.  We're gonna get back on route,  we're gonna give the judges burgers before pizza,  and we're gonna get that fifth place prize money!  (laughs) I knew you could do it, Bob!  I never lost faith in you.  Oh, come on, the road is blocked?  Teddy, stop the float.  Ah, I knew we'd never make it.  We'll just have to put this thing in reverse  and go until we can get back onto the route somehow.  I thought this thing doesn't go in reverse.  It doesn't, but we could all hop off and push it backwards  No, Bob, let's not drive anymore, please.  Lin, but I think we're close to the finish.  Bob, why don't we leave the float here  and walk the rest of the way?  - We'll come back later and pick it up. - What?  Come on, Bob, don't you want to have a little fun  before this whole thing is over?  This parade is not about having fun, Lin.  No. Of course not.  Well, I want to have a good time.  - Come on, Bob. - No.  I'm getting this thing to the finish line before Pesto.  You guys can walk if you want.  Okay. What do you say, kids?  You want to walk the rest of the way  with your mom and all the freaky people?  Freak yes, I do.  - Let's go. - Let's do this.  All right, Bob, we'll see you at the beach.  Kids, let's go get weird.  Wow. You chose me over your family.  That's not what happened, Teddy.  I'm on it, Bobby.  Okay, we just have to find another way  back to the parade route.  I think we can still beat Jimmy.  And there he is.  JIMMY: Hey! Is there a parade on that street, too, Bob?  (chuckles) A bad one? Uh, zoom!  Damn it. It's over.  Wait. What if we ram the barricades?  Excuse me?  We floor it, hold on tight  and burst right through.  Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© float, solid barricade.  Let's do it.  The coast is clear, Teddy. We're ready.  Here we go!  (engine revving, tires screeching)  (yelling)  Yes! Oh, the burgers.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  (coughing)  Is my ass on fire?  Be honest. A little bit, Teddy. A little bit.  - Anything? - TEDDY: Nothing.  Well, we lost.  Pesto beat us.  Judges are, like, 50 yards away  eating his horrible pizza.  We can't even finish and we're so close to the end.  (sighs) I mean, when you say it out loud  all at once, it makes it sound bad.  Stereo still works.  Want to listen to Linda's tape?  (sighs) Not really.  Oh. I already pressed play.  - Parade puddles! - Paradles!  Uh, I'm not sure this is all water Eh, it's fine.  You don't know what you're missing up there!  Come down here and splash.  Oh, you're not wearing any underwear.  (over speakers):  Just when I thought   I was lost and washed out   Someone reminded me what it was all about   Look at those guys, just sloppin' around in puddles.  BOB: They do look like they're having a good time.  Ah, ah, yeah   (sighs) I guess I haven't been very fun today.  Yeah, but this really isn't your scene.  What do you mean?  It's just Those people are really fun.  Look at 'em. They're free spirits.  Maybe I have been a little grumpy.  Come on, we're here for the cash prize.  That's what matters here the money.  What, do we have to live life to the fullest  at this particular parade?  No. We're here on a job.  (sighs) Oh, my God. What is wrong with me?  Ah, the beat's about to kick in.  You know what? Turn it up.    Teddy! Unzip my pickle!  Unzipping your pickle, Bobby.  Is that Bob?  (gasps) He's playing ""Hot Pants Rain Dance""!  It's like a fun, wet, almost naked version of Dad.  Disco? I'll go.  I'm dancing! I'm having fun!  Hey, kids! I took my clothes off!  TINA: Go, Dad!  Shake what Grandpa gave you!  But maybe not like that!  Lin, I'm sorry I was such a jerk today.  I let Pesto get the best of me.  But I love Bog to Beach now!  I totally get it! (whoops)  Oh, I forgive you, my little floatstest with the mostest!  Hey, get up here. It's your song.  Kids! Come on!  What happened? Why'd you stop your float here?  We broke down. We're stuck.  We were trying to get to the judges.  We could push you.  Or someone could push you. Guys?  Let's motorboat this float.  TEDDY (singing along):  Hot pants rain dance!   Da-da, doo-doo rain   I don't know the words.   Get down from there, Jimmy Jr.!  No, Dad! I'm dancing!  (whoops)  Hey. Sorry about earlier, Tina.  I shouldn't have messed up your float.  That was not cool.  It's okay. Sorry I shot you with a shirt,  and that you crumpled up into a little ball on the ground  and looked really weak and fragile.  Uh, okay, uh, it really hurt.  Should we have make-up dance?  - Yeah! - (hooting and hollering)  So hot your pants on fire     Well, we were just about to give the prize for fifth place  to the guy who gave me this wet pizza,  but The Bear Trap just rolled in here and stole our hearts!  Ladies and gentlemen, fifth place prize  is The Bear Trap!  (gasps) Bobby, that's us! We're The Bear Trap!  Yes! We won fifth place!  ALL: Yay!  What? We were robbed.  I don't know, man. That was amazing.  They came across the line and people started dancing.  It felt bigger than all of this.  Oh, would you just shut up.  All right! Mwah!  So I, uh, I wonder what it's gonna cost  to fix this float up, huh?  Bob? Not gonna be cheap.  Don't ruin this, Teddy!  Hot pants rain dance   Get out there and take a chance   Hot pants rain dance   Get out there and shake your pants   Hot pants rain dance   Get out there and take a chance   Hot pants rain dance   Get out there and shake your pants   Bah bah bah bah bah   Bah bah bah bah bah bah   Bah bah bah bah bah   Bah bah bah bah bah bah   Hot pants rain dance   Get out there and take a chance"
"1    Wow, that does sound pretty amazing.  I'll I'll be sure to look it up.  Anyway, I just double-checked the walk-in,  and five boxes should work.  Thanks, Demitri. Talk to you  - Oh. He, he's gone. - What happened, Dad?  Did the meat guy just hang up on you in a huff?  No, my phone died.  The battery only lasts about ten minutes  before I have to charge it again.  You really need to get a new phone, Bob.  - That one's older than Gene. - And hairier.  My phone wouldn't have died if Demitri  hadn't spent so much time talking about a big sale  at Outdoor Adventure World.  He said they're closing the location in Bog Harbor  and everything is marked down.  I guess today is the last day.  You guys have great conversations.  It actually sounds like a pretty good sale.  - I'm gonna look it up. - LOUISE: On your ancient  16-pound laptop.  I don't know.  Remember that camping pizza oven  that you swore we needed?  We never used it once.  I set it up. I think.  I used it to dry one of my swimsuits.  Perfect crust.  Wow. These discounts are incredible.  75% off? I could get some kayaking stuff.  Kayaking. You. Really?  I could be a kayak guy. Maybe.  Right, 'cause the only thing holding you back all these years  was the insane cost of paddles.  Okay, maybe not a kayak guy,  but what about a climbing guy?  Let's talk about the word ""guy.""  All right, we get it.  There's a tough outdoor Bob hiding inside  - that squeezable indoor body. - Thanks.  You know what, if you really want to go to that sale,  - why don't you go now? - Really?  Sure. I mean, it's the last day.  The kids and I will finish up the dinner rush  and close up before Gayle comes over.  Wait, Gayle's coming over?  Yeah, she wrote a one-woman show.  She needs to do a run-through before she debuts it.  - She wants feedback. - What?  - Uh - Mmm  - Be nice. - Okay, then, I'm definitely gonna go.  We can go to the store with you, Dad.  - Yeah, this that sale sounds great. - I want to go with you, Dad.  No way, JosÃ©s.  I need you kids here in the restaurant.  See you guys later.  Say hi to Aunt Gayle for me.  You walk out that door,  we're through, mister. You hear me?    Whoa.  Hello, outdoor stuff.  - Welcome to Outdoor Adventure World. - (gasps)  - I'm Austin. - Uh, hi.  Big sale. Huge sale!  Sad we're closing, but happy you're getting a deal.  Uh, yeah, great.  Now let's get you in some gear.  What are you in the market for?  I've demoed everything in the store.  Uh, kind of just browsing.  This sleeping bag is insanely comfortable.  - Oh. - In fact, I'm taking this one with me  on the Appalachian Trail next week.  That sounds um  I'm gonna go over here.  You looking for a split-grain leather or a full-grain leather?  I'm not really looking for any kind of leather.  I'm just still browsing.  Well, if you change your mind,  just leather me know.  Scuba? Spear fishing?  Oh, my God.  You do mountain bikes? Road bikes?  - Racing? - Oh, look, there's a tent.  Ah, good eye.  That's a four-season tent.  It's basically a house.  You put a mailbox on the front of that,  you can call it a day.  Uh, I'm gonna check out the inside.  I'll I'll see you later, maybe.  All right. Take a look at that vestibule.  I can't really hear you, I'm inside a tent.  Oh, and the vents Look at this mesh.  Ooh, I'm gonna zip this up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, zip it up.  Who's ready for the world premiere  of my one-woman show?  Gayle, hi.  Aw, we could hardly wait.  Kids, tell your Aunt Gayle how excited you are.  What is this, like one of those one-act, five-minute things?  Sometimes even three minutes can be a thrill.  Well, I, for one, loved it.  Should we head over to the wrap party?  Kids, come on. What's it called?  It's called ""My Boobs Are Down Here:  Laughing and Aging and Raging and Laughing.""  I love it. Oh, and it's so great  they're letting you perform at the library.  Yeah, I'm doing it in the hallway,  where the water fountains and the bathrooms are.  It's part of a series called ""Art in the Hallway:  Where the Water Fountains and the Bathrooms Are.""  Okay, I think we're all closed up here.  Why don't we head upstairs?  Just one quick thing:  the play gets a little messy.  Messy? Wait, what do you mean?  Oh, you know, at one point I spill some milk  and slip in it.  - Okay. - In another part,  I violently stab a few pillows and rip 'em open.  - Oh. - Go on.  Also, there's about a dozen spit takes.  - Perfect amount. - Hey, you know what?  Why don't we do it in the basement?  It'll be like our own little theater.  Down there, you can be as messy as you want to be.  Great. That way, no one will hear me scream.  This is gonna be the most age-inappropriate  - thing we've ever seen. - (phone rings)  Bob's Burgers: it's a dead cow on a bun  but it's still really fun. Also, we're closed.  - Gene, it's me. - Oh, hi, Dad.  Have you been answering the phone like that?  Yep. People love it.  (sighs) Well, tell your mom that I might be a little late.  It's a really great sale, but  I'm kind of avoiding an employee.  Oh, sure. That makes total sense.  You're not having an affair at all.  Who is it? Is it your secretary?  Gene. Gene? Oh, crap.  Stupid phone.  Hmm, this is pretty great.  Maybe I'll get this tent. Ooh, kind of expensive.  That's not much of a discount. Maybe not this tent.  But one a lot like it.  One that maybe smells like it.  Or maybe a kayak that smells like it.  (excited laughing)  Whoa.  Whoo-hoo!  Ah.  Oh. That's weird.  It's quiet and dark in here.  Oh, my God. It's quiet and dark in here!  Crap, crap, crap, crap!  Oh I can't can't get out!  Can't (grunting) can't get out!  Damn it! Oh! (groans)  (panting) Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Oh, no, they locked me in!  And I slept through the sale! Noooo!    All right. Stuck inside Outdoor Adventure World.  It's okay, I'll just try the emergency exits.  - (metal clanks) - Crap.  - (metal clanking) - Crap.  Crap!  (grunts) Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap!  (sighs) All right, I can I can just call for help.  Oh, no, I can't. Phone's dead.  Okay, uh, landline.  Damn it.  Aah! That's bright.  Wait. Is that a motion sensor?  Hey! Is there anyone there?  I'm in here! I'm stuck in here!  (imitates police siren) Come on!  (sighs) Linda and the kids are probably worried sick.  Your dad's probably upstairs wondering where the heck we are.  GENE AND LOUISE: I'll go tell him. I can go.  - I'll go. - No, no, I'll just text him.  It's all right, it's fine.  Write on the phone what you want to say to him  - and I'll run it up to him. - Shh!  Chapter two: birth.  My first studio apartment was a cozy uterus.  But, boy, was it small, and the plumbing was a mess.  But when I started to put up a fight, I was evicted.  (imitates crying)  The hospital carelessly, casually threw away my placenta,  and in some ways, I've never recovered.  - (kids gasp) - Ugh, it's wet. Why is it wet?  Oh, God, get it off, get it off.  Chapter three: day one of my life.  Where it all went wrong  and then right and then wrong.  Okay, tried that door already.  That door's locked. That's the bathroom.  That's where I went to the bathroom  when I didn't know there was a bathroom.  Glad no one was here for that.  Hi. (screams)  - It's Austin! - Huh I, I, I,  I remember. I didn't get your name.  - Uh, Bob. - Hey, Bob.  Wh What are you doing here?  Well, my big Appalachian trip starts next week  and I didn't feel like paying a whole month's rent.  What are you doing here?  I, uh, fell asleep in that tent.  Ha! Nice, man.  Wait, where have you been this whole time?  Oh, I've been hanging out in the back office  listening to my audiobook.  Don't Wipe with That: Hiking the Appalachian Trail.  It doesn't actually work that well as an audiobook, though.  I feel like the illustrations are probably important.  Okay, yeah. Um, can you please show me  how to get out of here?  Hmm I don't really know if there is a way out.  They locked and chained all the doors.  Well, how were you planning on getting out?  Oh, I was just gonna wait until the moving crew comes  to get the rest of the merch in six days.  No one's coming here for six days?  No, today's the last day of the sale.  Store's closed forever.  Oh, my God.  Wh What about the alarm system?  Why isn't that working?  Ah, I turned that off so no one would know I'm here.  Well, if you turned it off, does that mean  you can turn it back on and then I could use it to get out?  Okay, yeah, if you don't tell the guards  that I'm here when they come for you.  Um, sure.  (beeps)  All right, give 'em a wave, Bob.  - (bell ringing) - BOB: Yes!  It's working! The alarm is working!  (laughs) Look how excited you get.  All right, I'm gonna go hide.  Don't tell 'em I'm here.  Actually, yeah, no, tell 'em I'm not here.  You want me to explicitly tell them that you're not here?  Yes. No.  Uh, but tell them that I said hi.  No, wait, that doesn't Never mind!  (ringing continues)  This place is locked up, but I didn't see  - any signs of a break-in. You? - Nope.  False alarm. Shut it down.  Eh. This isn't so hard.  Why'd they say this job was hard?  It stopped. Nobody's coming in.  I'm gonna set it off again.  (groans) It's not working.  Oh, sometimes if they get a false alarm  they just shut it off.  But this isn't a false alarm,  this is a real alarm.  Well, I know that. They don't know that.  W Will you please just put the code in again?  (beeping)  - Yep, this thing's shut off. - Oh, great.  Yeah, they're not the best security company.  It was my second sophomore year in junior college,  and I took a trip to New York City  with my friend Stacy Micelli and my sister Linda.  - Mom, that's you. - Name drop.  We were in the denim district,  waiting in line to buy knock-off jean bras,  when an elegant woman walked by.  I looked up, she looked at me,  and she gave me a wink and the finger guns.  Pew-pew! And that woman was Delta Burke.  - (gasps) - It was the briefest of gestures,  but it meant so much to me.  A Designing Woman.  That moment helped design this woman.  (swoons)  And now a quick intermission while I change into a leotard  for the next part of the show:  Chapter 32: TGI Lie-Days:  Why you shouldn't date any of the bartenders  at TGI Fridays especially Dave.  - Unbelievable. - Seriously,  it's hard to believe Aunt Gayle was close enough  to have smelt-a the Delta.  Yeah, hard to believe because it didn't happen to her.  It happened to me.  Wait, Mom, are you saying that Aunt Gayle stole  your Delta Burke wink and finger gun story?  Yeah, it was me who got winked and gunned.  We had a connection. I'll never forget her eyes.  If it bothers you, you should say something, Mom.  Yeah, something vulgar.  No, no, it's fine.  It means so much to her, let her have it.  I've got a good life.  And one hot son.  More jerky? No?  Would it help if we gave each other trail names?  I'm gonna call you Friendly Breath.  What's mine? Give me one.  Please, just tell me there's another way out.  What about Cool Breeze?  You think I could be a Cool Breeze?  You know? Kind of see that? Like, uh  I don't know, you know who I'm talking about?  Austin, please, is there another way out of here?  I-I have a family, I-I can't sit here  and eat jerky with you for the next six days.  Okay, fine.  Well, there is one other way out.  Really? What is it?  (whistles) Skylight.  You can't be serious.  - How would we even get up there? - What?  We've got a whole variety of climbing options  over on aisle 14.  Uh, no to that. No.  Well, the other option is me and you doing this for six days.  Cool Breeze and Friendly Breath, bonding up a storm.  Yeah, that's the stuff. Breath and Breeze!  Okay, let's climb.  Great! This is gonna be fun.  Quick question: how big is your crotch?  - What? - For your harness,  you look like a medium, but I don't want to assume.  This is so exciting.  We're gonna climb to the skylight.  What exactly is the plan?  Well, I was thinking  we could use a crossbow to shoot a fishing line  over that girder.  - Okay. - It's called ""line launching.""  - Have you seen Cliffhanger? - Oh, no.  - What about Vertical Limit? - No.  Really? So good.  But also terrifying, so I'm glad you haven't seen them.  Lots of people die in those movies.  - Oh, my God. - Anyway, once we're both up there,  we crack the skylight with an ice axe, aisle seven,  then you're on the roof and down the fire escape.  Oh I hate all of this.  Hey, do you want the blue gloves or the brown gloves?  - Uh, whichever. - How about this? On the count of three,  we just say which ones we want, okay?  One, two, three.  - Blue. - I don't care.  Great! I'll take the blue.  So now, when I look at myself in the mirror,  I do one of these (clicks tongue)   and two of these. Pew! Pew!  And I'm flying Delta!  Thank you! Thank you!  (Linda grumbles gibberish)  - Mom. - Oh. Oh, bravo!  Bravo. Great job!  Whew! Okay, so tell me what worked and what didn't,  and be honest.  Just remember, I hate criticism.  Mm, it all worked so well.  Mm-hmm, uh-huh. You didn't think  the menstruation scene was too much?  I think it would work without the bubble machine,  - but who am I to judge? - Disagree.  Let's be honest. The show really gets going  with that Delta Burke story.  Tell us more about that!  (Linda grumbles gibberish)  You know what I think?  I think she saw a little bit of herself in me.  Mm-hmm. Yeah, that was it. Mm.  Linda, you were there. What was it like  when you saw Delta Burke wink at me?  Yeah, what was it like?  It was great.  It was really great.  When she shined her light on me.  Yeah, it was just so Mm. Mm!  Was it painful for you?  Was it cold there in my shadow?  Oh, it didn't happen to you, okay?! It happened to me!  - What? - She winked at me!  And finger-gunned me!  You stole my story! You Delta-burgled it!  Oh, I see. You're jealous.  Kids, let's go upstairs and go to bed because it's late,  and your father's probably wondering  what we're still doing down here.  Great show, Gayle, except for all the lies.  How dare you, Linda?!  Ladies, ladies, ladies, there's somebody else  who was there. We have a witness.  (gasps) That little Amish boy!  No. Stacy Micelli.  Oh, yeah. Maybe we can find her number and call her.  She can tell us what really happened.  Fine, then. Let's do it.  We'll call Stacy Micelli,  we'll wake her up, and we'll settle this.  Unless you're scared.  I'm not scared.  Pew, pew.  Don't you ""pew, pew"" me.  - I ""pew, pew"" you! Pew! Pew! - Uh, pew! Pew!  Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew-pew-pew-pew. Pew, pew, pew, pew.  - Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. - Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, infinity!  This is my favorite part of the show so far!  Sorry you had to wear that teen harness, Bob.  (straining): Oh, it's fine.  So, when I get to the top, you just do what I did, all right?  - Right. - (grunting)  There we go. (grunts)  This would all be so much funner  if you'd seen Vertical Limit!  Okay, we're all tied off up here.  - Climb on, Bob! - Okay. (grunts)  (rope squeaks) I don't know if I can  (airy panting)  pull myself up.  You can do this, Bob. Keep going!  (whimpering) Am I almost there?  Uh, sort of.  So tired. So, so tired.  Oh. I'm gonna take a break.  Okay. This is really an early break.  Actually, can I take two breaks together?  - Bob, this is gonna be easy - (yelling)  (Bob gasps, Austin yells)  - Oh. (grunts) Oh. - (groans)  (screams) Aah! Okay, okay, not good!  - Austin, what happened?! - Uh, well, to be honest,  I don't know about those knots I tied.  Wait. What does that mean? Were they not knots?  They were not not knots.  They just, you know, weren't, like  They weren't, like, the best knots.  What?! Don't you do this all the time?  Uh, this was kind of my first time.  What?! I thought you said you used everything in the store.  No, I said I demoed everything in the store.  Very different, okay?  Look, the sales rep comes, you know, we talk shop,  he shows me the merch, and and then I go sell it.  (whimpers) His name's Pablo!  So you've never actually used this stuff in the real world?  I mean, not like Pablo.  So, what if I, uh, uh, try and pull on this?  No, no, no, no, don't touch that rope!  Aren't you attached to that rope?  Not, like, that much. Not as much as I'd like.  Oh. Well, it's up to you now, Bob.  Wait. What's up to me?!  You got to climb out of here and get help.  How am I supposed to do that?!  (laughing): It's fine. It's fine.  You're you're just gonna have to  free-climb up to the skylight.  Free-climb up to the skylight?!  Yeah. I was trying to say it casually,  you know, so you wouldn't get freaked out.  That didn't work. I-I'm totally freaked out.  Okay. Side note: I'm gonna have to pee soon, okay?  And at this angle, it's gonna get weird fast.  Is that for my pee, or in case I fall?  Both, I guess.  M-Mostly the fall.  But I'm gonna fall in my own pee.  Well, maybe hold it then? Just a thought.  I should've gone before I climbed.  It's the first rule of climbing!  That can't be the first rule of climbing.  All right, I'm-I'm gonna climb the wall now.  I can't believe I'm saying that.  Should I just clip into this safety rope right here?  Sure! I mean, it's not connected to anything, but  sounds like you're getting into it!  Oh, my God. Uh, this wall is for, like,  advanced climbers, right?  I mean, technically, it's for beginners  but maybe, like, advanced beginners?  Listen, Bob, I feel like I want to say something.  I I realize now that I'm I'm not an outdoors guy.  Maybe I never will be an outdoors guy.  Maybe I'm just a poser  who sells outdoor equipment really, really well.  And looks really, really good in it.  Even right now probably. I don't know.  Listen, Austin. (grunts) I get it, I do.  I-I love this stuff, too, and I don't know  if I'm actually that serious about using it  out in the wilderness, but I love it.  And maybe that's okay.  I mean, I was looking at that folding shovel.  I'm not even sure if that's what it is, but I want one so much.  Oh, the folding shovel.  (chuckles) I have three.  They're in my car.  - I wish everything folded. - Yeah.  Ugh, but you know (chuckles) I don't even know  if I even want to hike the Appalachian Trail.  I just planned it because Lisa  from the cycling department was going.  She's so pretty.  Austin, let-let's come back to you in a minute. Is that okay?  I just feel like I need to focus on the climbing part right now.  Just one more thing. She smells like coconuts.  That's it. Okay, all right, climb on, Bob!  So you're calling me at 11:45 p.m.  to ask me if it was you or Linda who Delta Burke winked at  and finger-gunned 20 years ago in New York City?  - Yes. - And to see how you're doing. Hi.  But mostly the other thing.  Also, Linda's kids are here Tina, Gene and Louise.  We're great.  Don't mind us. We just want to know the truth!  - Please don't yell at me, strange boy. - I like her!  - Listen, here's what happened that day. - Moment of truth.  That wasn't Delta Burke.  - (both gasp) - BOTH: What?  - It wasn't? - Wha-What?  First of all, she was speaking Italian.  Second, she had a prosthetic leg.  And third, Delta Burke was shooting a movie-of-the-week  in California at that very moment.  We argued about this for the rest of the trip,  and then we never spoke again.  But thanks so much for calling.  It wasn't Delta Burke?  I guess not.  - What a journey. - (crying)  You know what?  I think Stacy is jealous.  And I think it was Delta Burke,  and it was you that Delta winked at.  - Oh. You do? - Yeah, I do.  And you shouldn't change a thing in your show.  I mean, you could take some cuts.  Shh. Tina, shh.  Aw, Lin, thank you.  Hey, I got something for you.  Pew! Pew!  Aw, right back at ya. Pew! Pew!  I think I maybe don't understand ""pew, pew.""  Sometimes it's angry, sometimes it's friendly.  Is ""pew, pew"" like ""aloha""?  - (groaning) - You're doing great, Bob!  I can't see you 'cause I'm facing the other direction,  but it sounds like you're doing great.  (groans) Thanks, Austin.  - Oh, I can see you! - (groaning)  Ha, nice, Bob!  You're almost up the wall!  Oh, I hate rock climbing. I know that now.  (groans)  Oh, my God, I did it.  I climbed the wall.  Whoa, whoa, I-I'm really high.  O-Okay, now I just have to  scooch along this girder over to the skylight.  I love the way you say ""scooch""!  It's not technically correct, but I do enjoy  hearing you say things you're doing, Bob.  Okay, this really scary.  (whimpering)  Man, I wonder how high up we are.  40, maybe 50 feet?  Austin, please, not a good time.  You're even higher than me.  You're more like 60 feet up.  Ha! Aren't you scared?  No. No, Austin, not at all.  I made it! I'm there!  You did it! I think. I can't tell. I'm twisting now.  Okay, there you are.  Man, that harness is tight!  All right, here I go. I'm gonna break the skylight.  - Hey, Bob. - Yeah?  Before you go, I want you to know that  I love you.  I, uh I-I love you, too.  And, also, don't forget to get help.  You're gonna have to call, like, everybody.  Uh, police, fire, my boss.  Maybe Lisa from cycling.  No. I know. I'm gonna get to a phone and call everybody.  Great! Now break that skylight, Friendly Breath!  You steely-eyed mountain man!  (screams)  Yes! (laughs)  You did it!  I'm so proud of you, I'm crying, Bob!  (crying)  Some of it's pee, but most of it's tears!  (laughing): Yes!  Yes!  So it was Delta Burke? I-I'm confused.  It's whoever you want it to be.  Aren't we all Delta Burke?  That's right, Gene.  So, did we talk enough about how I climbed a 40-foot wall  and then escaped through a skylight?  I think we covered it pretty well,  and we definitely believe you.  Watch out. Mom's gonna start telling people she did it.  It's nice you made a new best friend.  Austin and I are not best friends.  We're just going shopping together next weekend.  We're gonna check out this new outdoor omelet pan.  You lost me at ""outdoor,"" you had me at ""omelet,""  and then you lost me again at ""pan.""  (""I Want to Take You Higher"" playing)  BOB:  Hey, higher   I want to take you higher   I want to take you higher   I want to take you higher   Boom, Shaka-laka-laka, boom, Shaka-laka-laka."
"1        BOB: All right,  breakfast is served. We got some French toast,  eggs in the hole, bacon, and hash browns.  (whistles) Is that it, Dad? You're kind of phoning it in.  Uh, what can I say? I like making breakfast.  He's got eggs, and he knows how to use 'em.  Oops, I dropped some egg.  Oh, no. If only we had a dog,  it would be cleaning that up for us right now.  Guys, we've been over this. I know that puppy you saw  - last week was cute, but - I beg your pardon.  ""Cute"" is not a word that even begins to describe  - what that puppy was. - He was like Shirley Temple  stuffed inside a teddy bear  stuffed inside that kid from Jerry Maguire.  (sighs) We can't have a dog.  Dogs are expensive The food, the vet,  the Halloween costumes.  Oh, also having a dog is a lot of work, and you kids hate work.  You never do any of your chores. Y-You don't floss.  Yeah. Hey, weren't we gonna start using a chore wheel?  That's right. Whose chore was it to make the chore wheel?  - Not me. - Not me.  - Not me. - Not me.  Please, please, please let us have a dog.  KIDS: Please?  Wow, that was good harmony.  - But no. - (kids groan)  Okay, we didn't want to have to do this,  but we drew some pictures of the family. Gene?  Here we are, dog-less.  Note how gray and empty we all look.  - LINDA: What am I holding? - TINA: You've got a knife  and you're gonna stab Dad.  - Oh, yeah. - And here we are with a dog.  Ooh! I look good.  Yup. The sun is shining.  Look at the light. Look at the color.  BOB: Um, who's the other woman?  LOUISE: Mom let you get another wife.  You met her when you were out walking the dog.  Her name is Susan. She's a homeopath.  I like Susan.  So, can we get a dog?  - (Both) No. - (sighs) Poor Susan.  Now I'm afraid I'm gonna stab you.  TINA: Wow, that's a long line.  Yeah. What is going on over there?  LINDA: Look. ""Now serving brunch  and all you can drink Bloody Mary-naras.""  Hey, Bob. I-I see you got a huge line outside your restaurant.  (chuckles) Oh, wait, oh, that's me!  (cackles) Zoom.  Only we do.  Oh that's very funny, Jimmy.  Yeah, it's called brunch, Bob.  Read about it.  Why don't you read about it?  - Yeah, here, read this. - (farts)  (both laugh)  He's talking about his butt. Like it's a book.  - Hey, don't explain it. - Just clarifying.  I'm going inside now, so have fun.  There's no line. You should get right in.  Stupid Jimmy Pesto.  Do that many people really go to brunch?  Yeah. Families, young people, big groups of girlfriends  who all just broke off their engagements.  Maybe we could do brunch. We already serve food.  Well, I do love cooking eggs.  It could be fun.  And so I said, ""I don't get hungry, I get fun-gry.""  Oh, honey, if you're fun-gry, I'm fun-starving.  - I like dating. - Check, please.  (laughter)  Let's do it. But I get to be the Carrie.  Mom, you're the Stanford Blatch and you know it.  Linda, you wouldn't be going to the brunch,  - you'd be working at it. - Oh. Right.  GENE: Sucks for you, Mom.  Uh, you kids would be working, too.  - Yay. - Oh, we'd love to,  but we have to go to church.  But look at that line outside Jimmy's  - We could really use the money. - For a dog.  - No. - Ooh, we could serve mimosas.  But we could call 'em Mom-osas, after me.  Yeah. Or Gene-mosas, after Gene Simmons.  Okay, let's do it. Let's do a brunch.  Good, yeah, this'll be great.  Bob's Burgers' Brunch.  We'll see who has a bigger line tomorrow, Jimmy.  Hello, Belchers.  How are we today?  Uh-uh, hi, Mr. Fischoeder.  Ca Uh, can we help you with something?  We-we sent you the rent. It was very late, but  Right. Yes.  - Uh, thank you. - Do you  - want to see a menu? - (chuckles): Oh, no.  No. No, I do not want to eat your food, Bob.  I'm actually looking for my brother, Felix.  You haven't seen him, have you?  No. How long has he been gone?  Do you think he's okay?  Oh, I'm sure he's fine. Uh, it's just that  ""Crocodile Rock,"" uh, came on the radio and I don't want,  uh I don't want him to miss it.  I love that song. It's about when The Rock was young.  (clattering) -Ugh. Louise, I asked you to take this out  to the Dumpster last night.  Oh, the Dumpster Dumpster.  I thought you meant something else.  (sighs) Go.  - Now. - Okay.  See? See how much I love to work?  I see. We still aren't getting a dog.  I'll break you yet, Robert Belcher.  - Felix? - Shh! I'm hiding.  Well, Mr. Fischoeder is inside looking for you.  What?! Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  That's who I'm hiding from.  - Why? - I can't tell you, but let's just say  that I'm in a lot of danger if he finds me. Oh, did he already  - look around in there? - Yup.  Then that's where I should hide.  Now that he's looked in there, that spot'll be good for hours.  Hey, if I came back later, could you let me in?  - What's in it for me? - What do you want?  I want a lot of things, Felix.  But right now I want money for a dog.  - You owe a dog money? - No. (sighs)  What would you say to $250?  - I'd take it. - No, you pay me.  - That's okay, too. - All right, we'll hide you.  Great. I'll be back later tonight.  And one more thing you can't tell anyone you saw me.  You have no idea what's at stake.  Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to finish my garbage fries.  What did I do with my garbage ketchup?  Hmm. I thought for sure I would find him in this area.  He always turns up in the dirtiest places.  W-Wait, what?  Oh, did I say dirty? I meant dingy.  Louise, you still have the trash.  Ha! I do. Crazy me. So forgetful.  Hmm. You were out there an awfully long time  and yet you did not throw the trash away.  Talking to someone, were we?  What? No.  Bob, mind if I poke my head in your alley, so to speak?  (sniffs) He was here!  - He was? - Oh, yes.  If he wasn't, then who does this belong to?  Wha I don't see it. W-What are you talking about?  It's a hair. A single, limp, blonde hair.  A hair I'd know anywhere.  That's crazy. We get all kinds of blondes in this alley.  We have to shoo them away with a broom.  Well, this has been really fun  and, uh, not weird at all,  but we better get back to our dingy lives.  All right. Cheers, pink ears.  What was that all about? Are you two dating?  No, but we are going to hide his brother in our basement.  Nice. I knew it was one or the other.  Granny! That hurt my sweet little fingers.  Okay, your Dad and I have to run a few errands  - for brunch tomorrow. - I'm making a topless burger  with a fried egg and hollandaise  that is really complicated, so  Wait, are you topless or the burger?  - Hmm. We'll see. - All right,  bye, bye, bye. (kisses)  - Stay out of my room! - My room, too.  Stay out of our room!  - Okay, sister, spill. - Spill what?  Apparently, we're going to hide a man  - in our basement? - Go on.  - Well, a Felix. - Oh.  Psst!  Okay, so we brought you down a blanket, a pillow  (mouth full): Some potato chips. No, wait, never mind.  Here's a DVD of Prelude to a Kiss starring Meg Ryan.  I mean, there's no DVD player down here  and we lost the DVD that  Oh, don't worry. I've hidden in much more boring places  than this for much longer than one night.  I just need to stay hidden until 12:30 p.m. tomorrow,  and then I win.  W-Wait. Win what?  You said you were in danger,  and I took advantage of that for money.  In danger of not winning hide-and-seek.  We play every year on our birthdays.  The birthday boy hides, and the non-birthday boy seeks.  - It's your birthday? - Oh, no.  My birthday was 19 days ago.  You've been hiding for 19 days?  - Smell me. - (sniffs) Ugh.  Huh. I'd say 15.  And if I make it to 20, I beat my brother's record.  Why aren't you hiding somewhere cool, like Europe?  Or the Upside Down.  Well, the rules are you have to stay in town, you can't carry  any money, and you can't kill anyone to keep them quiet.  Can you kill them just to send a message?  Wh-When you say ""no money,"" we're still getting our $250  of sweet, sweet dog cash, right?  Yes. Keep me hidden till 12:30 p.m. tomorrow,  - and I'll make it $251. - Whoa.  But if Calvin finds me before then, you get nothing.  You really think Mom and Dad will let us get a dog  - if we have that money? - Sure, that'll cover  a couple months' expenses. And then do you really think  they'll want to give an adorable little fur-ball back?  I mean, they kept Tina, and she can't even shake a paw.  I'm working on it.  BOB: Well, hello, eggs.  ""Hi!"" You guys ready to be in some amazing frittatas?  ""We sure are!""  You guys seem pretty egg-cited.  Get it? (laughs)  ""You're really funny!"" Thank you.  Hey, Bob, if you're done talking to the eggs,  come out here and take a look at this.  Sorry, I have to go talk to my wife.  ""Run away with us, Bob.""  I can't. Well, maybe.  W-We'll see.  (hums) Is it great or what? I even drew a  - little champagne glass, you see? -   Good morning, sleepy-beepies!  Oh, hey, Mom and Dad. How are you? Good morning.  You guys sure got up early and snuck out of the house.  How's it going? Have you been down in the basement?  Um, yeah, of course we have. Why?  Oh, cool. Very cool.  How was it?  It was the basement.  What the hell is going on?  (giggles nervously) Not much. How are you doin'?  Um, you guys are acting really weird.  (laughs) You're acting really weird.  Okay, well, can someone go get me some tomatoes from the walk-in?  - Me! - On it!  Yep!  - What was that all about? - Oh, it's probably all part  - of this dog thing. - Oh, right.  We're never getting a dog, right?  - No way. - Okay, good.  If anything, maybe a monkey.  - Right. Wait, what? - Monkey.  Felix, it's us, Tina, Louise, and Gene Belcher from upstairs.  FELIX (muffled): I'm back here!  (grunting)  He's like a human Karma Chameleon.  (winded): I had to tuck myself in here this morning  when your parents came down.  But I had a nice head of lettuce for breakfast,  and I'm feeling okay.  Aren't you cold?  Yes! I think I might lose a toe.  But it'll all be worth it to see the look  on Calvin's dumb, warm face when I break his record.  Okay, you need warmer clothes.  We can get some, but we'll have to distract Mom and Dad  so they don't ask questions.  We could say something like, ""Don't look in the basement.  There's no man down there."" Huh?  Here are those tomatoes you ordered, Father.  And now we're going to just pop upstairs for a second  because we have a little surprise for you.  Good surprise or bad surprise?  Eh, surprise me.  Y'all ready for this?  Introducing  (humming fanfare)  -  Brunchsquatch! - (Gene humming)  LINDA: Oh, my God, I love it! Brunchsquatch!  Aw! Cute little construction paper bacon and eggs.  - Bob, do you love it? - Yeah, it's a good idea.  We can send him outside to drum up business.  Okay, Brunchsquatch distraction was a success.  (grunting)  - Little help? - (grunting)  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. In.  Ooh, look, a line! We're like a nightclub!  Or an understaffed drugstore.  That's great! In your face, Jimmy.  Okay, quick meeting, everybody. Gather round.  Wh-Where's Louise?  - Bathroom. - Mexico.  All right, well, when she's back, she's running food.  Linda, you greet 'em and seat 'em.  Tina, you're on busing and water  and picking up weird stuff off the floor.  How do I know if it's weird?  Like that Band-Aid. Weird? Not weird?  Gene, you go outside, do your thing, and bring 'em in.  I'll shake my little benedicts! Bum, bum, bum!  No, no, no. Don't don't do that. Just  - No, no, no. - Roar! I'm a little tiger!  - Gene, don't do that. No, no. - I'm a sexy little tiger.  - Don't do that. - Yeah!  - Please, no. Just get customers. - Shake, shake, shake.  I'll be in the kitchen, making the world's best brunch.  On three. One, two  Okay, you're - you're opening the door.  Hello! I'm Linda. Welcome to Bob's Burg  - (singsongy): I'm here! - Oh.  Dame Judi Brunch, as you live and breathe.  Yes, it's really me. Yes, I'm really here.  Yes, let's really have brunch.  (chuckles): I'm sorry. Dame Who-Di-what? What is it?  Wait. Oh, my God. This is adorable.  You don't know who I am.  I don't.  She doesn't know who I am. Okay, I love you.  Um, okay, of course, this is your first brunch day,  so how could you? My real name is Dalton,  but I write a blog, Brunch Drunk Love,  - under the name Dame Judi Brunch. - Wow!  And this is Jennifer, other Jennifer, and Greg.  - Hello. - [IN UNISON.] Hi.  So you said you write a brunch blog. I'd love to see that.  How do I find it? Do I, uh I blog dot net or something?  Or I just print it out? Or what do I do?  (laughs): Oh, my God, so funny!  Okay, now, what is that? What am I looking at?  - (grunting) - That is my son. He's Brunchsquatch.  Stop it. I'm dying.  No, you stop it. Don't die.  I won't. I'm dying. I won't stop.  Okay, so, first things first, bring us two mimosas each.  And we'll look at the menu. Never stop being you.  Oh, my God, I can't believe I just met a blogger.    Wow, it's really filled up!  We're having a buncha brunch!  Linda, this orange juice tastes a little off.  Well, it's got champagne in it, Teddy.  What? I had four of 'em!  Well, why'd you drink so many if you thought they tasted weird?  - I wanted to fit in. - Oh, you. Ooh, you want a little more?  Maybe. Maybe half a glass.  Linda, where are the orders?  Well, no one's ordered food yet.  They sure love the Mom-osas though, huh?  - Louise, there you are. - What? Nothing.  O-Kay. Uh, go take some orders.  These people need to have food with their alcohol.  You got it.  - (bell jingles) - (gasps)  Oh, hello, little Belcher!  Thought I'd stop by for brunch.  I left something here yesterday, and I've come back for him.  Mr. Fischoeder, hello!  Um, do you want brunch?  Yes. One brunch, please, Linda.  I've been searching for brunch all over town,  and I've come to believe it's here.  It is here.  So, I'm gonna go get you a Mom-osa.  - Get it? (chuckles) - You get it.  - (chuckling) - (chuckling): I will, I will.  So, child of Bob,  where do you think that sneaky little brunch might be hiding?  Well, landlord of Bob, I don't know what you're talking about.  Am I drunk or are you guys having a weird conversation?  - Both. - Both.  So, some news.  You're gonna want to stay put,  because your brother is upstairs.  - What?! - It's okay.  He's way up there, and you're way down here.  You don't understand! He's like a bloodhound.  And now I'm trapped.  Geez. Calm down. Gah.  I will take care of this. Just stay here, stay warm,  and, for God's sake, stop eating all the lettuce.  It's not even washed.  ""Why aren't more people ordering us, Bob?""  I-I have no idea, eggs.  I mean, I'm sure they will v-very soon.  - Order up. Tell your eggs. - Okay. Here we go.  One frittata for table five.  Wait, there's, like, seven people  crammed in that booth. They just want one frittata?  LINDA: Guess they aren't hungry.  So far, the only person who ordered a lot is The Dame.  His table got one of everything.  Wait. Why are you calling him ""The Dame""?  He's Dame Judi Brunch and he runs a blog about brunch.  - Oh, cool. - Back off. He's mine.  I'll go ask him what we're doing wrong.  Maybe we didn't make the right kind of food or something.  Shh, shh. Don't listen to her, eggs.  You guys are perfect. ""We don't like her.""  She's just jealous of us. ""We know.""  All right. We need to figure out a way to get Felix  out of the basement without Mr. Fischoeder seeing him.  This seems like what the phrase  ""Hey, look over there"" was born for.  Whew, I need to pee  and I feel like I shouldn't do it out there  on the sidewalk again.  People did not like that.  (gasps) Yes, Gene, that's it.  You do need to pee.  I love how excited you are about this.  No, no, no, listen, listen. Come here.  So, why did you agree to hide Felix, Louise?  - Did he offer to pay you? - Did who offer to pay me?  (quietly): And do you want to pay me more?  (laughs) No, I-I-I don't need to.  My hide-and-seek record has stood for 15 years.  The closer it gets to 12:30, the more fun it will be  to see his face when I find him.  - And I know exactly where he is. - Oh, really?  Yes. He's in the basement.  What? That's crazy.  (laughing nervously): Well, he's  And I'll be there, too, very soon.  But for now, I'm going to sit here, drink this terrible mimosa  and let him think that he's going to make it to 12:30.  Well, I better go before I embarrass myself.  You know what? Maybe I'll just  So, Dame, how do you like your food?  Where do we fall on the brunch-o-meter?  How do I like this brunch? How do I ugh.  - How can you even ask me that? - Oh, I mean, uh  I don't like it.  - I love it. - You do?  The Frittata Have Faith? The Waffle Truth?  I almost literally never say this word,  - but this brunch is amazeballs. - He says that all the time.  - He never says that. - Wait. What?  Well, do you know why no one else is ordering anything?  (laughter)  - Oh, no, Linda. - Oh, no, what?  Linda, please tell me you have a meal-per-P-minimum?  A PP what? A PP what?  Okay, okay. If you read my blog, you would know this.  A meal per person minimum. Look around.  You've got a restaurant full of brunch skunks.  Oh, no. Not brunch skunks!  What are those? What are those?  Oops. Ugh. We need new glasses!  That is a brunch skunk, Linda.  They're just here for the bottomless mimosas.  You didn't say they each had to order a meal,  so they've got empty stomachs, and (gasps) Oh, my God!  Are these drinks not watered down?!  Of course not. Who waters down a mimosa?  First of all, I know. But second, it's brunch.  Okay? We went to that place across the street yesterday.  I had 16 Bloody Marys and I wasn't even buzzed.  - I had 20. - She had 20.  We all drove home.  - Oh, my God. - And once the skunks settle in,  it's almost impossible to kick them out.  They're like bedbugs.  I've seen brunch skunks throw up in their booths,  and just keep drinking.  I've seen a boy brunch skunk  fight his way out of an ambulance  to try to get back into a restaurant for more drinks.  This is bad, Linda.  This is very bad.  Oh, God. I got to go tell Bob!  Yes, you do.  But before you do that, could you be a lil' cabbage  and grab us another round of Mom-osas and some more  jalapeÃ±o aioli for our burgers? Love you. (kisses)  Yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay, okay!  Well, I guess it's time to go crush someone's dreams.  - Mine? - No. No, my good man.  - Someone clearly beat me to that. - Oh, good.  Oh. Pardon me, breakfast monster.  Gene, wait. I-I need your help. Stay here.  Bob, I'm going down to check your basement for leaks  and Felixes and whatnot before the winter season.  That's um, uh, okay.  - Bob! Bob! We got brunch skunks! - What?  Brunch skunks! These people just came for the drinks.  Skunky little booze hounds.  Miss, miss. We need more drinks over here!  - That a brunch skunk? - Yes, definitely a brunch skunk.  - (retches) Wait. Whose purse is this? - (sighs) Oh, crap.  Okay, we can save this. We'll just tell all these people  they have to go, and then we'll seat everyone in line  and tell them that they have to order a meal.  - Okay. - Gene, go bus the tables.  Take every glass, even if it's full.  Louise, Tina, help your brother.  Sure. But shouldn't Gene go back outside, probably?  No. No, no, no. W-We need you guys in here.  - And, Linda. - What?  You got to start giving out checks.  (sighs): I know, I know.  Be brave.  (singsongy): Felix. I'm gonna getcha.  I'm a-comin' to get you.  You'll never get away.  I got you now.  I can smell you breathing, Felix.  Caught you just at the last second.  - (screams) Hi. - (screams)  Damn it!  So, this is your check.  I'm putting it down right here.  I don't remember asking for the check.  I want more drinks.  Okay, well, no.  We actually have to cut you off. I'm sorry.  The sign says ""bot-tom-less drinks.""  You can't just add a bottom.  That's illegal.  I'm calling 911.  I'm sorry, but you have to go.  In fact  all of you, you all have to go!  Oh, Linda, no.  Ow, my face!  I'm gonna get my own drink.  LINDA: No, no, no. No, you aren't. Sit down.  Ow, ow, ow. You're walking on my legs.  (gasps)  - Gotcha. - Felix, run!  - No! - (grunts)  Brunch brawl!  (crowd clamoring)  Mr. Fischoeder, what are you doing?! Get off Gene!  - You rang? - Gene? Wait.  - Who's in the suit? - Felix Fischoeder.  (chuckles) Sure. Makes perfect sense.  - (cork pops) -Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  No! No, it's not me! It's not me!  I'm not Felix!  Ha! 12:29!  - 12:29! - No!  (siren wailing)  911 is here!  Now you're gonna be in big trouble.  - So this is brunch, huh? - I love it.  Ah, thank God they're all gone.  - The cops were nice. - And we learned the police code  for brunch brawl: ten-ten over easy.  Well, you didn't beat my record,  but you still get a birthday present, just like always.  Should we go pick out a car?  - Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yay, car! - (bell jingles)  I can't believe you guys hid Felix in the restaurant  and we didn't even know.  Yeah, and we fed him and took care of him.  Aw, that's nice.  So that probably means we could get a dog?  It does not mean that at all.  (groans, sniffs) You guys serving lunch yet?  Uh Yeah, sure.  - Lunchsquatch! - Yay!  - LINDA: And so I said, -   ""I don't get hungry, I get fun-gry."" (laughs)  - Linda, that's amazing. - (laughs)  I'm putting that on a shirt, and I'm wearing it  - absolutely everywhere. - (laughs)  Brunch is served.  Bob, I cannot believe you cooked me a private brunch.  - Of all the private brunches - (kids laughing)  I'm gonna go to this weekend, this will probably be the best.  Oh. Well, uh, thanks for, uh, bringing your dog.  - My-my kids appreciate it. - (dog barks)  Yeah, here's a picture of all of us and you and the dog.  Okay, what are you guys doing to me there?  Oh, we're stabbing you so we can keep your dog.  GENE: I'm using a pitchfork.  DALTON: I feel really unsafe right now,  - and that's not funny. - (DOG BARKS)  Just kidding, I love it.  But am I wearing flip-flops? Because no.  LOUISE: Okay, everybody, start stabbing on the count of three!  - GENE:  I'm a little tiger  - BOB: No, no, no, don't do that.  GENE:  I'm a sexy little tiger  Roar!  - BOB: Please, no. - GENE:  I'm a little tiger   - CHORUS:  I'm a little tiger  - BOB: No, no, don't.  GENE:  I'm a sexy little tiger   Shake, shake, shake, I'm a little tiger   BOB: Gene, don't do that.  No, no, don't do that. - GENE:  I'm a sexy little tiger   - CHORUS:  Sexy little tiger  - GENE: Yeah!  I'll shake my little benedicts    I'm a little tiger   I'm a sexy little tiger."
"1  Two more pages.  Oh, I don't think I'm gonna make it.  One word at a time, sweetie. Push through.  - I need water. Oh! - What's going on?  Louise is reading Old Yeller.  I believe it's pronounced ""old yellow.""  Uh, why?  I mean, I wish I wasn't asking  why one of my kids is reading a book, but I am.  It's for a school read-a-thon.  If the entire student body reads 500 books,  we earn a trip to Wetty, Set, Go water park.  Oh. Is that place back open?  I thought it was closed because of the  The kid who lost a finger?  The diarrhea in the wave pool?  - Fake lifeguards? - The flesh-eating bacteria?  - Yes, all of those. - No, it's back open.  Everybody, quiet!  Yeller's got rabies, so a vet's probably  about to come and cure him, and that'll be that.  - Oh, God. - I don't think that's what happ  Ah!

Oh, boy.  What sick, twisted, but really creative kid did this?  For all I know, you did, Louise.  No, no, no. This wasn't me.  LOUISE: This is cray-cray cray.  - It's three crays. - What I do know is,  there will be no trip to the water park,  until the fiend who did this is caught or comes forward.  - No way! - No!  Come on!  (slurps) Sorry.  I'm self-medicating with a soothing  Caramel Chamomile from the new pod coffee machine  in the teachers lounge.  I wondered why you smelled like my aunt.  Yeah, you smell just like his aunt.  Yes, I've heard this before, I smell like your aunt, yes.  You know what? This whole thing  has kind of a Millie touch.  Remember those homemade ""presents""  she put in my locker?  (quick screams) Millie!  Millie is the one student I know didn't do it.  She's at home this week recovering  from an extensive orthodontia procedure.  Why didn't she wait till she's in her 40s to get braces?  Like Gwen Stefani.  Can't believe I read for nothing!  I want that water park.  Maybe Mr. Frond will catch whoever did it.  Him? He couldn't catch his butt with two hands.  We got to solve this ourselves.  Take some pictures, gather some evidence  Put the evidence in little baggies, label the baggies,  put the baggies in an evidence locker.  But where are we gonna get little baggies?!  (bell tinkles)  Hey, guys. You know Janine,  from the stationary store?  - Hi. - Sure. How's it going over there?  Great, right?  People are never gonna stop buying birthday cards.  - Actually, people have stopped buying birthday cards. - Oh.  But I still sell a lot of staples and paperclips.  The Internet can't hold two pieces of paper together.  - Not yet. - Janine and I have news.  We're partners. Not romantic partners.  - Right? No. - Mm-mm.  - No, we are not. - No, we're not.  Teddy and I are going into the inspirational poster business.  Oh, I love those posters.  That baby with the spaghetti on his head.  That got me through my thirties.  Yeah, it's a funny story how it all came together.  I was up on a ladder fixing Janine's ceiling fan  and I fell onto a bunch of erasers.  Oh, that's kind of lucky. Soft erasers.  They were on a glass shelf.  - Oh, my God. - Yeah, so that broke.  And under that were X-Acto knives.  - Pointed up. - Oh.  Still don't know why you store 'em that way.  - It's a display, it looks better. - Right.  So I was lying there bleeding somewhat heavily,  and I said to myself, ""Shake it off,  today is tomorrow's yesterday.""  And I said, ""Hey, Shakespeare,  that would go great on a poster.""  Turns out Janine's been taking pictures for years,  just waiting for the perfect poster phrase.  - I've got beaches, I've got clouds - Yeah.  I've got a monkey holding a banana like a phone.  Who's he calling?  (laughs) It's fun to imagine, right?  Eh Michael Jackson.  We finally settled on a sunrise.  Or maybe it's a sunset, we don't know.  The sun was in my eyes, I couldn't tell.  (chuckles) And I was high.  So we printed up 1,000, and here we are.  - 1,000 sounds like a lot. - Bob!  - We already sold one. - Great. To, to who?  Well, to you, right? Don't you want one?  - Of course we want one. - Uh, uh  - I want one. - Yeah, sure.  - We'll take two. - Wait, why would we want two  of the same poster?  'Cause what if we both want to look at it?  I want to look at it.  Two coming right up. One, two.  Okay, what do we know?  We know a psycho did this.  We just have to get in the head of a psycho.  Too bad we're not Millie. Not that she's psycho,  but she's, you know, psychish.  Tina, that's it!  Wait, we are Millie?  I knew it.  No, she can be our psycho-sultant.  Louise! Is that really you?  Yep. Wait, you know who I am?  I guess I should know my daughter's best friend.  I only see your face every time I turn around.  (eerie music plays)  Gosh, I've heard everything about you.  Bob and Linda, the restaurant, Teddy the handyman  We're Gene and Tina.  - Sorry, who? - Um, the siblings.  - Come again? - Gene and Tina.  No.  Can we go up and see Millie?  Last room on the left.  Don't give her gum or hard candy.  Nothing pointy that she might use to pry off her headgear.  And don't get too close,  the braces make her spit a little.  (Gene groans)  (foreboding music plays)  Hi, Louise.  Hi, Millie. You're in my room,  you're in my room, you're in my room.  Yeah Oh, my God.  Hey, Louise, Millie's room is exactly like your room.  That's definitely cute and not creepy.  Anyway, uh, we just wondered how you were feeling.  No, how are you feeling, Louise?  Your voice sounds strained.  You've been yelling about something, I can tell.  - Bad news at school? - Wow, she's good.  (inhales)  Someone has hard candy.  Gene, give it to her. (groans)  (loud inhaling)  Well, Millie, I would like your help.  - (gasps) - Somebody, not you,  but, you know, maybe kind of like you,  chopped up Mr. Frond's therapy dolls  and got the water park trip canceled.  Oh, no. I read Old Yeller for that trip.  - Oh, did you? - Mm-hmm.  Here are some pictures of the crime scene.  They're not touch screen, they're just pictures.  Not that anyone thought they were touch screen.  Okay, I've got some ideas, and I'd be glad to help.  - As a friend. - Great.  But friends play together, Louise.  I'll help you, in exchange for play dates.  I scratch your back, you scratch mine.  I really want to scratch your back, Louise.  No! That's extortion, Millie.  Get out of my room.  It's my room, Louise.  (laughing): It's my room!  Fine, I'll do it.  (sighs) Don't leave me alone with her.  Um, what about us, Millie?  There's a trampoline in the back.  Go bounce and stay out of our way,  not-Louise girl, not-Louise boy.  Scream if you need us, Louise.  No, no, no, no, no, no  Sorry, toots, we got to go talk to tramp named O-line.  - Gene, I'm kind of worried about - (Gene grunting)  Louise in there alone with Millie.  Me, too. I'm also worried about  my testicles banging into each other.  Who am I kidding? I love it.  Okay, it's got to be someone who hates Mr. Frond.  But that's everyone.  When everyone has a motive,  maybe look for who doesn't have a motive?  La la la la la.   Yes. Wait, I don't understand.  Enough detective work.  Let's do fun things.  Hey, I know, we'll put on our own play.  You be you, and I'll be you.  And we take a bow and we won a Tony.  Back to the case.  Well, whoever did this knew Mr. Frond's schedule.  Kind of like (laughing) how I know yours!  Yes, and someone who knew which drawer the dolls were kept in.  Like one of the kids getting counseled, of course!  Let's make a list.  Nah. Karaoke time.  MILLIE:  My love   There's   Only you in my life   The only thing that's bright   (singing flat):  My first love   Your every breath   (both rapping): Wooriga gatchee itnun gun, baby baby!  Okay, uh, yes, we sound  amazingly great singing Korean pop.  But we got to focus.  Let's see. All the dolls are messed up,  except this one.  Miss Understood.  Is it because whoever did this felt misunderstood?  Wow, that's a great question.  Let's dress up my cat.  Oh, my God!  - (cat meows) - You're staying, Muffin.  Oh, a tramp named O-line.  Now I get it.  Yeah.  Uh, Lin, are-are you sure that's where we want Teddy's poster?  Why, what's wrong?  Nothing, it's just that it's kind of in my eye-line.  And it's dumb and I hate it.  That's how inspiring posters work.  You got to see them again and again until they kick in.  Like taking antibiotics.  Wait, did you put the other one up over our choking poster?  It was depressing.  Ugh, a picture of that guy gagging.  Right, but someone could choke.  - I mean - Bob, relax.  Look at Teddy's poster.  Tomorrow is tomorrow goes tomorrow  Uh, that's not what it says.  - Today is tomorrow. - It's not working.  - And breathe - I don't like it.  That was the most exhausting play date of my life.  But we made progress.  We burned some calories on the trampoline.  And I think the family next door really started to warm up to us.  Yeah, I watched half of Jurassic Park  through their window. Every other second.  Well, I guess I got to keep this going till we crack the case.  Play dates, play dates   Having lots of play dates   I'm gonna play with you till we die   Play dates, play dates   Super fun play dates   Gonna play together until we die.     Someone obviously hated those dolls. But who?  Let's talk about Old Yeller.  Forget Old Yeller.  But it was such a great yarn.  Didn't you think it was a good yarn?  Wait, yar, yarn.  There's something about the yarn.  Maybe.  Millie, why do you turn everything  into a freaking  Wait, I know yarn people.  Tina, Gene, we need to go somewhere.  Okay. The neighbors shut their blinds anyway.  Rude.  Shoplifters. Harold, wake up.  What? Oh.  Boost your airplane glue someplace else, you hoods.  And then take it on back to Boys Town.  We're not shoplifters. Wait, what's Boys Town? It sounds interesting.  Listen, someone cut up this doll.  Do you see anything unusual?  Hmm. This yarn isn't cut, it's unraveled.  - It's what? - Unraveled!  - Ah! - Why not just cut it?  Why were they so careful?  Here's a question. Why are you still here?  Buy some pipe cleaners or get the hell out!  Okay. Geez.  We're so close to solving this.  Millie's an odd bird, but she does have a head for this stuff.  - What's that? - Oh, it's just a Millie and me  friendship collage I'm working on.  (scoffs) Got to play the game, right?  That's a lot of glitter glue.  Maybe less is more? Learn to edit yourself?  Seems like Millie's kind of becoming a real friend, Louise.  She's not a friend, Tina; we've had some fun.  I mean, not ""fun,"" but you know shut up.  I get it. It's like that thing I've got with Mom. Why put a label on it?  Oh, Mr. Frond. I want to update you on Operation Waterpark's Back On.  - Um, okay. - Mr. Frond!  - I'm turning myself in. - Zeke, you don't have to do this.  You need that field trip, Jimmy Junior.  - Zeke, you did it? - Yep. Typical me.  I hate those, uh, what do they call it again?  - I hate it, though. - Dolls?  - Yeah, dolls. - Yeah.  So everyone gets to go to the water park, I guess.  You get to go, Jay-Ju!  You get to go.  Okay, I'm I-I, I  Oh, God, I need help!  - Little help! - Somebody help him!  Come on. He needs help.  So, uh huh.  That's case closed?  LINDA: Hi, Teddy.  - Hi, Janine. - Just seeing how the poster's doing.  How it's doing? It's dying. Dead.  People seem a little unfamiliar with the concept.  So what does it do?  - You-you read it. - And it changes your life.  And where would I put it?  - On a wall? - I don't really do walls.  I live in a converted gazebo with my improv group,  - so it's like - That's enough out of you.  I don't know what the problem is.  The poster's got everything, at least, graphically.  ""At least graphically""?  Maybe the phrase isn't as good as I thought it was.  Or maybe your sunrise is really a sunset,  and it's wrecking the mood my words create.  I get them confused.  - I already explained that. - Um  I liked the chimp with the banana phone.  That was, like, your only good one.  Why did I take a chance on you?  Why did I let you take a chance on me?  Oh, my God, I love it.  Guys. You got a customer.  She's going for her wallet.  Oh, thank God. Sorry about a second ago.  - Oh, me too. You're the best. - That was crazy.  - No, you are. - And click.  - What are you doing? - I'm posting it.  No, stop that. You got to buy it.  It has so many likes. You're welcome.  No, those are our ideas!  Well, I need another poster.  Oh, wait, I forgot my wallet.  So anyway, I guess I don't need to come over anymore.  Oh, come on, Louise.  You actually think Zeke did it?  Yes. I mean, okay,  he didn't seem to know what he was confessing to,  but that's a very small detail.  I thought we were looking for the truth.  We were looking for the water park, Millie.  Have you been to Wetty, Set, Go?  The slides are so fast you'll get the kind of wedgie  that'll never come out and you just have to live with it.  But we're almost there.  And I think I know who did it.  Well, if you know who did it, just tell me.  You've been stretching things out just to keep me near you.  Ugh! You think it's all about you, Louise,  just because everything I do is all about you.  Okay, we're done, Millie. Go ahead and slam the phone down.  - No, you slam the phone down first. - No, you.  - No, you! - All right, we'll slam the phone down together.  BOTH: One, two, three  You didn't slam the phone You didn't slam the phone down!  Oh! You were gonna slam it down. All right, well, slam it down. Ready?  I feel like we should leave the room,  but this is a pretty cute fight.  - All right. - (Mr. Frond screams)  (panting)  After I left Zeke, I went back to my office  and found Miss Understood  - like this! - Ugh.  That means Zeke didn't do it. He couldn't have done it.  The son of a bitch is still out there.  The water park is off again.  Okay, so it turns out the case isn't solved.  I will be over at the usual time  and we'll crack this thing.  Hello?  Millie? Millie?  Millie? Millie?  Give it 12 more Millie's and call it a day.  All right, Millie was a tad upset,  but I can smooth this over.  Oh, Louise. Wow.  Um, I can't believe I'm saying this,  but Millie doesn't want to see you.  Awkward. (chuckles)  But come on, I'm Louise.  I'm the one from the pictures.  I'm just gonna slip in.  Shutting the door now, in your face.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh.  TEDDY: Well, we're dissolving  the poster business. Janine wants out.  Aw, Teddy, I'm so sorry.  Yeah, well, the pet shop down the street  offered to buy the rest of the posters at a deep discount.  They're gonna shred them for hamster cage bedding.  The guy was really impressed  with how much hamster urine they could absorb.  I can see that.  I'll give you back our posters if you want, so you can shred them.  - Bob, no. - But I mean,  if the hamsters just need even one  No, no, no, those hamsters are fine.  Believe me, I've been down there.  - They've got it pretty good. - Right. Yep.  I have to get to Millie somehow.  - She says she knows who did it. - I have an idea, Louise,  and I think you'll jump for it.  Because it's jumping.  Which I could have said first.  Millie, Millie!  Look, I'm sorry. I do want the truth.  And, uh, here's the weird thing -  I was having fun with you. (grunts)  - There, I said it! - It's true, Millie.  Louise really worked hard on that friendship collage.  Hi, this is Tina.  I still think she went kind of nuts with the glitter glue.  Solid work, but I just question her taste level sometimes.  (Pants) Please, we're running out of time.  Wetty, Set, Go never stays open that long!  Typhus can happen just like that!  All right. Mom, let Louise in!  Yes! I'm gonna come through the window.  Oh, never mind. Bad idea, bad idea.  Bob, you got to pick it up, we're getting clobbered.  Why are we so slammed?  Jimmy Pesto closed to watch them blow up that beached whale  in Bog Harbor and we're getting all his business.  (chanting): And grill and grill, and grill, and grill  I'm doing the best I can, Lin.  Uh, that's what I'm afraid of. Ha!  Work snap. Said with love.  But come on, seriously, faster, faster.  (groans)  FALSETTO VOICES: Today is tomorrow's yesterday.  - I get it now. - LINDA: What?  - Lin? - What?  - I think we're gonna be okay. - Okay, keep moving.  All I wanted was a friend, Louise. I'm a simple person.  (laughing): Sorry, you're just really not, Millie.  Okay, fine, but I'm good at seeing stuff you don't.  Like clues about who killed Mr. Frond's dolls,  or why you and I should be best friends forever.  I know. I get it. But right now,  can you just please tell me who did it?  Let's talk about Old Yeller again.  No, I hate that book.  Remind me what happens at the end?  You know what happened.  Because of the rabies, the boy had to shoot Yeller, his own dog.  I guess he really didn't like that dog.  What? No. He loved him.  Yeller was his dog.  That's why he had to be the one to do it.  He loved him so much, he had to be  the one to (gasps)  Mm-hmm.  It was you! What was me?  It was someone who knew your schedule. That's you.  Someone who knew where the dolls were kept.  That's you, again.  I loved those dolls.  They were my dolls!  Which is why you couldn't bear to cut them,  so you unraveled them.  It was done out of love.  Just like Old Yeller.  Old Yellow!  (laughs) That that is so farfetched.  That's just so  (groans) (grunting)  Come back!  You didn't finish your sentence.  ""That's just so"" what? Oh.  He's headed for the teachers' lounge! (panting)  You're not faculty. You can't come in here.  Damn!  Hi, Mr. Branca. Do you have a key to the teachers' lounge?  No, it cleans itself.  (laughs)  Here you go, everybody in.  Okay, so the word ""lounge"" is kind of an exaggeration.  It's more of a waiting room for farts.  We know you did it, Mr. Frond.  What I don't understand is why.  It's his fault.  Hush, you worm. LaBonz, palm strike his windpipe, now.  I can't believe I'm saying this,  but I think it's too late for violence.  He swore you kids would never read 500 books.  Of course I did.  - Look at them! - And then when you did,  we had to stop the water park from happening.  Why?  Because we already spent the water park money.  - On what? - Coffee pods.  The machine was cheap, but the pods are incredibly expensive.  You monsters!  When the pods blew the budget,  we tapped the water park money.  You could have drunk less coffee.  No, we couldn't have, Tina!  And then we had a problem.  They're getting close to 500 books.  Why did we pick that number?  I didn't even know there were 500 books.  We are in so much crap if that happens.  I'm gonna have a coconut macchiato  and put on my thinking cap.  This isn't coconut!  This is hazelnut!  So it's settled.  You sure we can't just do some graffiti?  Draw a penis on something?  No, it's got to be extreme.  We cut up your dolls and blame a kid.  I'll sharpen the paper cutter.  No. If it has to be done, I'll do it.  They took hours to unravel and arrange.  But I owed it to them.  Well, now that I understand everything,  I'll just pop down to Principal Spoors' office and let him  - Leave Spoors out of this. - (stuttering)  - Palm strike! - Of course,  if we get to go to the water park,  we may forget about everything.  I'm already starting to forget.  What are we talking about?  I don't even know where I am.  Okay, we'll pay for the water park, somehow.  Faculty car wash? I have a sponge.  Brag.  Bob, you've been so productive.  Did you organize the dirty rags under the counter?  Yeah, by smell.  Fancy pants.  And then I did an inventory in the walk-in, and  - trimmed all my weird eyebrow hairs. - Wow.  I think it was Teddy's poster; I-it kicked in.  You soaked up its wisdom, just like they're gonna soak up  that hamster pee.  Oh, my God. I hope it's not too late.  Me, too. What are we talking about?  Oh, yeah, these are gonna shred up nice.  - Thanks. - BOB: Teddy, Janine, wait.  I was inspired, by your poster.  I mean, not a lot, but somewhat.  And I had a very productive day yesterday.  It's true. It was like Cocoon.  I'm just saying, maybe you shouldn't give up so quickly.  I don't know, Bob. It's been really discouraging.  But Janine,  what would the poster tell us to do?  Um  What would it say, Janine?  ""Hang in there""?  No, that's another poster.  ""Keep on truckin'""?  Another poster, but  It would say ""Try again,"" maybe?  There she is.  You up for this, partner?  Still not romantic partners, I assume?  - No. - I'm in anyway. People change.  Hey, I've got an idea for a poster.  It's a hamster on a wheel and it says,  ""I'm wheely excited.""  - I love it. - Get out.  LOUISE: Well, we made it.  We're Wetty, we're Setty and we are about to Go.  Here's hoping none of us swallow Band-Aids today.  Jimmy Junior, wait up. Zeke,  what's the diarrhea sitch in the wave pool?  It ain't exactly Evian,  - but it's not wavy gravy, either. - Good enough.  Well, Millie, that's a nice swimsuit we're wearing.  We look good.  Thank you, Louise. As do we.  You want to go watch the wedgies down at the big slide?  And after that we could just move in together.  Easy, easy.  Okay, a hundred sleepovers.  I'll squeeze you in for a lunch.  - I get to chew your food. - Millie.   Play dates, play dates, having lots of play dates   I'm gonna play with you till we die   Play dates, play dates   Super fun play dates   Gonna play together until we die     Play dates, play dates   Having lots of play dates   Gonna play with you till we die   Play dates, play dates   Super fun play dates   Gonna play together until we die."
"1    OLSEN: It's been called the Beast of the Bay,  The Monster of the Marina  and the Wonder Wolf.  But whatever you call it,  it's allegedly extremely dangerous  and allegedly out for blood, wreaking alleged havoc  on our quiet little community, allegedly.  And it seems to be scaring the trick-or-treaters  out of town this year  on what promises to be a foggy night.  Meanwhile, the alpaca has gone missing  from the Wonder Wharf petting zoo.  I'm here with Calvin and Felix Fischoeder.  Could the alpaca have been a victim  of this so-called Wonder Wolf?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I'm sure the alpaca just went on a little walkabout.  Yes, that checks out.  The town is perfectly safe.  All the little children should go out trick-or-treating  - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - and then come spend their  parents' money I mean, come to Wonder Wharf and, well, you know.  If you are braving the local streets for treats,  parents are advised to accompany their kids  just in case this beast is more than just a rumor.  - It's not. - Oh. No.  Guess who's comin' in the room   With the fancy costume?   Um, what are you?  I'm a Cher-iff. Get it?  - Like Cher, but a sheriff. - Hmm.  I got handcuffs, a badge and a body that just refuses to age.  (gasps) Oh, I love her.  - ""Snap out of it!"" - Hmm?  - From the movie. - Mm.  You know, if you weren't on a bunch of pain pills,  you'd be cracking up right now.  I think those are making you less fun.  Probably a side effect.  See? ""Take with food.  Can cause hallucinations and diarrhea.""  Well, I don't have either of those except diarrhea,  so give me one.  Fine, but just one.  - You get weird on pain pills. - Mm.  Remember the time you thought the rug was making fun of you?  Or the time you took nighttime aspirin  and you ended up peeing in the blender?  You almost ruined that smoothie, Bob.  First of all, I do not remember any of that.  Second, you should've thrown that smoothie out  if that ever happened.  And third, what am I supposed to do if I'm in pain?  The-the pills are great for that.  So (clucks tongue)   give me my drugs, officer.  Okay. If you want to be a paranoid Patty.  - (doorbell rings) - Aah! What was that?  The doorbell. Calm down.  Right, right. Doorbell.  LINDA: Coming!  Hold your candy corns!  - (door opens) - (Teddy laughs)  TEDDY: Oh, a Cher-iff.  Oh, that is great.  Doesn't Teddy look hot?  I thought I ordered a scary nurse,  but I guess I clicked on sexy nurse instead.  Sometimes the universe decides, you know?  Anyway, Nurse Teddy is here to take care of you, Bob.  Uh, Linda, what is he talking about?  I told you, Bob, I have to go out  trick-or-treating with the kids  just in case the imaginary wolf is real.  Teddy's gonna keep an eye on you.  You aren't very good on those crutches, mister.  He fell down twice today trying to go to the bathroom.  (scoffs) I'm fine, Lin.  I'll help him get into the bathroom, no problem.  You can count on me.  I'll even hold your penis if you need me to, Bob.  I don't need you to hold my penis, Teddy.  Well, then I can just, you know,  I can just prop it up for you.  Use a broom handle or a dustpan or something.  I guess a spatula would work.  Great, uh, where's the spatulas?  I'm joking, Teddy.  I don't need you to hold my penis up with a spatula.  Right, right, I knew that.  So, how'd you mess your knee up, anyway?  It's a long story.  Hey, my old chef pants. I love these.  I wonder if I can still get into them.  (grunts)  Ow! Ow!  So not that long a story.  - No, I guess not. - GENE: (sings fanfare)  Get ready for your favorite fruity boy, Gene.  Ooh, grapes.  Handsome grapes.  Sorry, handsome grapes.  Hey, hey, you're The Monkees.  Peter, maybe? With an oxygen tank?  No, Mom, I'm the guy from No Country for Old Men.  LINDA: Ooh, a hunky killer.  The best kind, huh?  Ooh, Tina's a zombie  wearing my clothes for some reason.  Yeah, I'm a Mom-bie.  But you don't look like a mom  in those clothes; you look fun and youthful.  In these jeans? No, I look like a mom.  Young, fun mom.  Well, enough chitchat. We're burning precious candy time.  See you sometime before dawn.  Okay, let me just go spray my hair  one more time, and then I'm ready.  Why would you need to go spray your hair  for us to go trick-or-treating?  LINDA: Because I'm coming with you.  Uh, no? Sorry, Mother.  You must be this young to ride the trick-or-treat train.  Yeah, maybe you should trick-or-treat  with some friends your own age, Mom.  Tonight's about fun.  You don't bring a mom to a fun fight.  What? I'm fun.  Plus, I got to protect you from that wolf  that's terrorizing the town, but probably isn't real.  Ugh, I'd be so embarrassed if you kids got eaten.  (sighs) Fine. But don't try too hard.  And don't try too hard at not trying too hard.  I'm gonna be so fun, you're gonna wish  I trick-or-treated with you every night.  All right, let's get treatin'.  Yeah, let's turn some tricks.  Gene, don't say that.  Bye, bye, bye, bye. Stay out of my room.  TEDDY: You got it, Mrs. B.  - So, what do you want to do? - (door closes)  You can still thumb wrestle, right?  Best out of 31?  Uh, I was just gonna watch TV, Teddy.  Okay. Or we could watch TV. Sure.  ANNOUNCER: And now, our Halloween feature,  Bosom Bloodies.  Ooh, Bosom Bloodies. I read the books.  And coming up at 10:00, an update on the Wonder Wolf.  Ooh.  - What was that? - What was what?  Th-That howl.  I just said, ""Ooh.""  Oh. Oh, okay.  Jeez, you're jumpy, Bob.  You're jumpy, Bob.  ALL: Trick or treat!  Sorry I don't have candy.  The news said that no one would be out trick-or-treating  because of the wolf.  Yeah, we heard.  Kids, what do you say?  KIDS: Thank you.  At least apples are edible. I don't know what I'm gonna do  with all these twist ties from that other house.  This is bull. I want candy. I'm a kid!  It's not like I can just go out and buy it whenever I want.  Well, maybe the next block will be better.  LOUISE: Damn it! (sighs)  Should we just go home and eat spoonfuls of sugar?  TINA: I know where there's a hummingbird feeder.  GENE: I'm ready for tub and tuck in.  What? Are you kidding me?  We're not Hallo-quitters, we're Hallo-winners.  But no houses are giving out candy, woman.  We don't need candy to have fun.  You shut your damn mouth.  Hey! Isn't that the park  where people keep seeing the Wonder Wolf?  Why don't we go over there and find it.  Searching for a wolf is a great fun Halloween adventure.  I know this is gonna sound crazy,  but I'm scared of wolves.  Yeah, seems dangerous.  That wolf would probably love to eat  a plump, perfect boy like moi.  Come on. Are you guys coming?  (teasingly): Or are you too scared?  Fine, but I'm gonna walk in the middle  to protect my beautiful grapes,  and for once, I'm not talking about my testicles.  LOUISE: I guess it's kind of a good Halloween thing to do.  But if don't see a wolf, I want my money back.  All right! Hello, lady Bob.  Hey, Mr. Fischoeder.  You out trick-or-treatin'? Smellin' feetin'?  We're out looking for our alpaca, Al.  Have you seen him?  No. We're going to look for the wolf.  - (laughs): The wolf. - Wolves aren't real, Linda.  Okay, well, we're gonna go look for one anyway  because it's a fun Halloween adventure,  and I'm a fun mom.  Well, if I were you,  I'd go home and count your candy  and wait for St. Nick or Satan.  Whatever. I-I can Bye.  (woman screams)  (gasps) Oh!  Here you go, Bob. It's a cabbage soup  that's supposed to heal the body.  I got the recipe from a pop-up ad.  I just put in my social security number and there it was.  I'm not really in a soup mood. That's impossible.  - I'm gonna feed it to you. - No, no, just give it to me. I  - I'm gonna feed it to you. - I don't want you to do that.  Just let me feed it to you.  Here comes the helicopter.  Open up your mouth, Bobby. Here it comes.  - Uh-huh. Uh - Traffic copter. Here he comes.  - Oh, you got a little - What do you mean the traffic copter?  It's just It's a traffic copter.  - It's flying into your mouth here. - Why does it  Just a regular helicopter is usually the way. Just  It's a traffic copter. You got a little bit of a back up Okay.  -  here on 95. - All right, all right, all right.  If you're traveling north  - Whatever type of helicopter you want. - If you could just  - Let me do my thing, Bobby! - Fine.  - Oh. Ow! Ow! - What? What? What? What?  It's too hot. I'll blow on it a little bit here.  (blowing)  - Teddy, you're spitting on it. - No, I'm not. I-I'm blowing on it.  You're going (blows raspberry)  - This is how I blow. - What's that mark  on your arm?  What mark? I don't  There's no mark on my arm.  You just covered it with your sleeve.  Looks like a bite. No, it's not a bite.  It's dry skin. You ever heard of dry skin?  - Ow! Still way too hot, Teddy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.  This is, like, room temperature now, Bobby.  - Do you think that's room temperature? - Yes.  - Stick your finger in it. - Okay.  (both scream)  It's fine. It's fine.  LINDA: Ooh, look, a bone.  Must be from some animal  the wolf killed and devoured.  I think that's a hanger, Mom?  No, it's a bone.  It's a little metal bone with dry cleaning paper on it.  This is dumb. There's no wolf.  Let's just go home and trade apples with each other  - till we die of boredom. - Yeah.  Okay, fine. I tried.  (wolf howls)  - Mmm? - Whoa.  - Mom, did you do that? - No.  That did sound like one of Mom's chardonnay farts.  I don't think that was a real howl.  - (wolf howls) - (gasps)  Well, howl-lelujah.  I guess the Wonder Wolf is real.  I got to give you credit, toots.  I thought you were the mom that cried wolf,  but I think this guy's the real deal.  And that's a good thing. (laughs nervously)  Because we want it to be real.  Yeah, yeah, we want it to be.  Of course we do.  Everyone stay close to Mommy.  Okay. I always wanted to be raised by wolves,  but getting adopted by one at this age would also be cool.  Getting a little foggy out. I like it.  It's nice and spooky.  - (wolf howls) - (gasps)  - Whoa. - Wow.  I'm not saying I'm impressed,  but I'm not not impressed.  It came from over there, let's go.  LINDA:  Going over there   It's getting kind of real   But the kids are having fun   So we're going over there.   LOUISE: All right, not so much singing.  Oh, sorry.  Teddy, my knee really hurts.  - Ca-Can you hand me another pill? - Uh, I don't know, Bob.  Linda didn't say anything about giving you another pill.  Yeah, well, she's forgetful. I mean, look,  - she forgot her handcuffs. - Yeah, I don't, uh  I don't think that's a good idea, Bobby.  Come on, Teddy. I'm in pain.  I don't know. How many have you had tonight?  Maybe one and a half, or two.  Are you sure you don't want one for your bite?  It looks serious.  I-I don't need a pill for my bite.  Wait, you said it wasn't a bite.  It's not. You called it that.  Watch the movie, huh, Bob?  - Give me a pill. - Fine.  Here, I'm gonna cut this in half.  - Eat both halves. - That's a weird way  of regulating how much I take.  Well, then I know you at least had two halves.  Look at us tracking a wild animal  like it's no big deal.  Yeah, I haven't had this much fun  following in somebody's footsteps  since I started dressing like Mom.  - Earlier today. - LOUISE: Oh, my God, you guys.  - Poop. - Okay, I'll see what I can do.  - Short notice. - No, I think it's the wolf's poop.  Ooh, a spooky poopy.  There's little bits of fur in it.  This was definitely not pooped by a person.  But if it was, I admire the heck out of them.  (loud rustling)  - (all scream) - Oh, God.  It came from right over there.  Okay, I think he's  - TINA: Or she's. - Or she's behind that bush.  (door creaks on TV)  Oh, no, no, don't go in there.  (panting)  (distorted): Oh, no! You went in.  He went in!  Uh, uh, are you sure that's not a bite, Teddy?  Like, from an animal?  No. How many times I got to say it?  Okay. Then-then wh Then what is it?  I cut it on my pillow.  I'm gonna go to the bathroom now.  If that's okay with you.  And number one, since you're so nosy.  ANNOUNCER: Was the Wonder Wolf just a Wonder myth?  Stay tuned after our feature presentation.  (whispers): The wolf.  Teddy's a werewolf.  TEDDY: What'd you say, Bob?  Nothing.  No, he can't be.  He can't be a werewolf, that's crazy.  (Teddy growling)  Oh, no. He's transforming.  He's transforming.  - (Bob groans) - (Teddy growling)  (grunting)  (Bob groaning)  Oh, God.  (groans)  Oh, hi, Teddy.  - You okay? You look sweaty. - Yeah. It's just, uh,  an exciting part of the movie.  I-I think something's gonna happen to somebody.  - You're probably right. - Yeah, definitely.  - (grunts) - Oh, God.  Oh, my God. Bob! Bob!  - Ah-ha! Gotcha! - (Teddy yells)  Bob, what? Why? Why'd you do that?  - Because you're a werewolf, Teddy. - (grunts)  I heard you fighting the beast inside you.  - What? - You're the Wonder Wolf!  Or he bit you and you're turning into one.  Or you bit him. Bob  Or, or however this all works.  Bob (grunts) unlock me.  (grunts) Unlock me!  You need to sit down. You need to rest your leg.  Give me the keys, come on.  Oh. This isn't funny.  Oh. These keys? (gulps)  (mouth full): No way. Because I'm swallowing them.  (gags and coughs)  No. Wait, that's impossible.  (coughs) Ugh. How do people do that in movies?  (grunts)  Bob, don't try to go down the stairs.  - (Bob screams) - (clattering down stairs)  - BOB: Ow, ow! - (Teddy grunting)  - Are you okay? - (Bob shouting)  Bobby, answer me. (grunts)  No, I'm fine, Teddy. I only fell halfway Dow  (Bob screams) Ow  Ow! Ow! (groans)  Oh, God!  Are you at the bottom of the stairs now?  Wouldn't you like to kno  (Bob screams)  Bob, talk to me. Say something.  Don't pretend like you care about me, werewolf.  - No, Bob. No, Bobby, don't leave! - (door closes)  What'll we do now, Mom?  We are gonna take a picture of the wolf on my phone,  from a very, very safe distance, and then run away.  GENE: Oh, God. It's rustling again.  What kind of a monster rustles this much?  (moans)  I'm gonna go over and pull the branches back.  You kids stay back here and take the picture,  and then run away.  Okay, here we go.  ""Spooky Halloween adventure  with a fun mom"" on three.  One, two   three.

Did you see it?  - Uh - No.  - See what? - The wolf.  Right there. The wolf is in that shot.  The shot that's completely black?  Yes. I forgot a light, but that doesn't mean he's not there.  - Or she. - Wait.  Do you really think this wolf or whatever is real?  You saw it? Oh, it's real. I'm pretty sure.  I'm convinced.  Yep. And I'm gonna be the guy  who gets the footage to prove it.  I'll be famous. I'll be ""The Wolf Guy.""  My documentary will make millions of dollars,  and I'll probably get a wife.  Millions of dollars, huh? Randy, baby.  Why don't we work out a deal?  We help you get this thing on film,  and then we split the money 50-50.  Why would I want to team up with you?  We've got light. We've got gumption.  And we all want wives, too.  I'm gonna name mine ""Michelle.""  Kids, maybe we should just let Randy find the wolf,  and then we'll go see the movie when it's done.  Well, I do need light.  Yeah. You do.  Okay, you can help.  - Uh, hmm, all right. - But I get to pick  - where we have the premiere. - No, you don't.  - TINA: Hey, we could have it at the restaurant. - Fine.  But let's get it catered.  RANDY: Ooh, yes. And a photo booth.  (panting) Okay.  Okay, I got to find someone to help me.  Oh, that was smart of me to chain him to the coffee table.  Smart of me and dumb of him.  Dumb werewolf Teddy. (laughs)  (pants and grunts)  Bob, I'm coming!  Oh, no. Oh, no.  (pants)  (panting)  (grunting)  (breathless): Wow, running with a coffee table's hard.  No wonder no one does that.  (gasping)  (gasping): Bobby! Bob!  You can't get away, Bob.  (groaning): I'll find you.  I'm gonna help you.  (breathless): Good evening.  Happy Halloween.  I'm a nurse table, table nurse.  Farewell. (laughs)  LINDA: Maybe we should head home soon.  It's getting late and we've already had so much fun.  (scoffs) Home is for idiots.  Yeah. We're wolf hunters now.  Our old lives were garbage.  I thought mine was okay, but I see what you mean.  Okay. Here's a wolf-hunting tip.  See the way these leaves are all on the ground?  Probably the wolf came through here and knocked them all down.  Aren't those just fall leaves?  Fall leaves, at this time of year?  - Don't be ridiculous. - (screeching)  - (gasps) - (quietly): What the hell was that?  - The wolf. - No. Wolves howl. That was not a howl.  It sounded like the noise I made  when Felicity cut her hair.  What if this isn't just a wolf?  Maybe it's a super wolf or a monster wolf.  - (gasps) A werewolf. - (screeching)  Well, whatever it is, it sounds like it's in there.  TINA: Oh, that spooky, overgrown area  that looks like it's full of Blair Witches?  LOUISE: Yep. And we're going into that overgrown Blair Witch tunnel.  Right, Mom?  Yeah, of course we are.  I said we were going, so we are. So, yeah, yeah.  GENE: And with that rousing speech, we march to our deaths.  (grunts)  TEDDY: Bob!  Bob, I'm coming!  (laughs) I know you're coming, wolf-Teddy.  That's why I'm going  into the park.  I'll hide in there.  Good job, Bob. Thank you.  What is this place?  Huh. Is this a dead end?  Don't be silly, Linda.  There aren't dead ends in the woods.  You can just walk right into the  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Okay, so it's a dead end.  Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.  (all scream)  I don't like piles of bones unless they're on a plate  in front of me and I'm rubbing my stomach, going, ""Mmm-mmm.""  (screeching)  Oh, God, it's getting closer.  Randy, get the camera ready.  Uh  Dammit, Randy.  If you had been holding something,  you would have dropped it out of fright, too, Louise.  - I'm holding two things. - (rustling)  - Oh, God. - (moans)  - Kids, get behind me. - And I'll get behind them.  - Randy, no, you're a grown-up. - Not in all ways, Linda.  I wear a youth large at Forever 21.  - (screeching) - RANDY: Oh, God. Oh, God.  I'm really regretting sprinkling cinnamon and sugar  on myself this morning.  Oh, my God. I brought my kids out into the dark woods  on purpose to look for a dangerous animal,  just because I wanted you guys to think I was fun.  Now I think I might have made a mistake,  and it would have been better if we weren't attacked by a wolf.  Guys, maybe if we're all just really, really quiet,  the wolf will lose interest and go away.  It's worth a try.  (balloons pop, Gene yells)  - Gene. - Sorry.  If we all die, everybody, thanks for being cool.  You're welcome.  - Oh, Randy. I forgot you were here. - Mm.  Okay, that's it.  Kids, you stay here.  I'm going to fight this thing.  Good idea. You go get it, Linda.  Mother, I've never been more attracted to you.  I'll fight it off as long as I can,  and then when I can't fight anymore,  I'll try to be hard to eat so you guys can get away.  GENE: Okay.  Oh, my God.  (all screaming)  (screams)  LOUISE: What the ?  Are you freaking kidding me?  Wolves these days, not what I remember.  I think it's the alpaca from the petting zoo.  So there was no wolf?  Huh, I guess not,  but this guy's kind of fun,  in a matted hair, lice-y kind of way.  I'm gonna pet him.  Hi, cutie. What's your  - (screeches) - Oh, never mind, never mind.    - TEDDY: Bob! - BOB: Oh, no. He found me.  (grunting and panting)  (rustling)  Teddy?  (growls, snarls)  Uh  There you are, Lulu. You naughty girl.  You're gonna get daddy in trouble  (laughs): escaping like that.  I told you you weren't ready to have a wolf, Felix.  I am ready.  The wolf house I was building wasn't ready.  And I am not putting her up in a hotel again!  Oh, just hurry up and put her into the van.  We still have to find that damned alpaca.  Come on, Lulu. I brought a Hawaiian pizza for you.  - (sniffs) - (singsongy): Your favorite.  - (Lulu whines) - There we go.  Go, go, go, go, Calvin.  I'm going!  Yay!  (Teddy panting)  Bob, don't run.  (strained voice): Wolf.  I know, I know, Bob.  I'm a wolf.  But let's go home and talk about it there, okay?  I just saw a wolf.  Sure, sure. You-you saw a wolf.  You don't happen to have the handcuff keys, do you, Bobby?  Huh? You know what? Never mind.  I have to carry this back anyway. (grunts)  Look, I know the pills made me crazy before,  but in my defense, Teddy does have a bite on his arm,  and hair all over the back of his neck.  I do have a bite. I was embarrassed to tell you  that I bit myself in my sleep.  I used to do it in my 20s, and then again in my 30s,  and now, apparently, it's back.  Someone needs to be swaddled.  Or just bite your arms during the day,  so you won't be as tempted at night.  (sighs) Well, sorry, kids.  This Halloween was kind of a bust.  You didn't get any candy and there wasn't a wolf.  (groans) There was.  No. It was an alpaca.  I mean, a wolf in our little town?  It's crazy.  This isn't Transylvania.  Yeah, but there was almost a wolf.  And we thought we were gonna die.  That was fun.  Wait. Are you saying you had fun with me?  We're saying we had fun around you.  That counts.  There was a wolf. I saw it.  The Fischoeders put it in their van.  This again.  Shh, shh, shh, shh, Bob, Bob.  I did see a wolf.  Hey. I believe you, Bob.  Randy, I don't want you to be offended,  but I need someone other than you to believe me.  Well, I am offended.  Are you going home, Randy?  Not now. Now I'm staying forever.  Me, too, because I'm handcuffed  to your coffee table and you lost the keys.  I-I didn't lose them, Teddy.  I threw them to the moon.  It made sense at the time.  All right. I'll get you guys some sheets and blankets.  No, Linda. They're not staying.  RANDY: Can I borrow some pajamas, Bob? Maybe an oversized tee?  BOB: Absolutely not.  GENE: I've got your oversized tee, Randy.  - One question: do you like Betty Boop? - RANDY: Yep.  (Linda growling rhythmically)  All right! (cackles)  Who's a fun mom on Halloween?   She does spooky things and she looks really young   Who's a fun mom on Halloween?   She does spooky things and she looks real young   It's Halloween, it's Halloween   It's Halloween, it's Halloween   Hall ow eeen  (vocalizing)"

(blows raspberry)  Ha ha!  I'd like to think I can.  - You can't. - Remember, Tina,  we need you to babysit here tonight  'cause we're using that gift certificate I won  at the PTA raffle to go to that hot new restaurant, Savory.  Don't worry, Mom, I penciled you in for tonight.  I was hot and new once. Now look at me.  And copy.  And copy, and copy!  Just do your job, damn it!  Tina, gah!

It's just a headband. That's the whole story, the end.  Yeah, you guys, Tammy doesn't want to talk about  how her parents stopped paying for her hair dye,  and now she has real bad roots.  - Jocelyn! - What?  Mr. Ambrose, will you help me with the copy machine?  Oh, sure, I'd love to.  What are you even doing, Tina? Let's all focus on that.  Well, Tammy, I happen to be starting a babysitting business.  Tina, that's not a baby.  - No, I'm copying fliers for it. - Oh.  That's weird, to make it work, you have to turn it on.  - Oops. - Yeah.  Well, who would want to hire you, anyway?  People who like the smell your mouth makes when words come out?  No, more like people who like people  whose hair is all the same color.  (gasps)  Oh, no, girls, stop fighting.  (whispers): Keep going! Keep going!  People will hire me to be a babysitter, Tammy,  because I'm nurturing and kind  Things you wouldn't really understand.  I understand that you're being a boob pube.  Or how about an analogy?  See, I'm a good person, and you're horrible.  (screeches)  Not a great analogy.  Not even an analogy.  Shh!

(clears throat)  - I'm Tammy - And I was just wondering  -  if you needed me to be your babysitter. - Or me.  And a little bit about myself: I have a lot of experience;  I wear glasses, so you know I'm responsible.  And I don't wear glasses, 'cause I didn't lose my vision  like she would lose your baby.  Wow, (chuckles) coming in a little hot.  (chuckles): I guess we have been  looking for a babysitter for Kendra.  We're new to the area.

Hmm.  Uh, never mind. It's probably fine.  Yeah, yeah, odds are totally fine.  - She'll be all right. - Look, if you start getting murdered,  just call us.

Really good.  So, Chris and I thought that since we're all  just kind of getting to know each other,  you two could work together tonight.  - Sure. Fine. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah.  I mean, we do only need one babysitter in the future,  so we'll just see which one of you is  the right fit for Kendra.  You should know, our daughter is very sensitive.  - Very special. - Ever since we moved,  Kendra's had a hard time making friends.  - Oh, no. - Yep. (chuckles)  Oh, God! (crying)  Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.  - (yells) - He's been a little emotional lately.  Wow, that's so embarrassing. I mean, not the crying.  The not having any friends.  I mean, everything's great. You're all great.  (sobbing): It's all my fault.  It is. It is his fault.  We moved here for his job,  and it's just it's the girls at her school.  Monsters. B-words!  - Chris! - Sorry.  They've been bullying Kendra.  And this one gal, Laurie, she  She kicked Kendra in her tinkle-dink.  - Pardon? - What now?  It's the word we use for crotch.  Okay. And that goes for girls and boys, or  Boys have a tinkle-dinker.  - Right. - Obviously.  God darn you,  well-paying marketing job that brought us here!  Okay (laughs nervously)   let's go introduce you to Kendra.  CATHERINE: Hey, sweetie.  These are the babysitters  Tammy and Tina.  - Hey, Kendra. - Hey, girl.  It's me, the fun one.  - This is Mr. Boom Boom. - Okay.  He's my best friend.  That's right, honey. Oh, God!  It breaks my heart. (sobbing)  - Chris, come on! - We're on the clock, right?  We're getting paid for this moment right now, right? Just checking.  LINDA: You know, I was really looking forward  to going out to a nice restaurant tonight  and being a fancy lady.  A hot, fancy lady with a gift certificate.  Well, then, here's an idea.  Why not bring us with you?  I mean, you kind of owe it to us.  You won this dinner 'cause of the PTA?  Well, we made you the ""P.""  Yeah, we made you both ""P.""  Hmm, Louise does have a point.  Uh oh, all right, let's go.  But I'm still drinking a lot of wine.  Said the world's best mom.  CATHERINE: So we'll call to check on you in a bit,  and there's some frozen pizzas for dinner.  - Okay, bye, girls. - Bye.  Bye. Have fun, you crazy kids.  I know we will.  (both laughing forcefully)  I'm gonna babysit the crap out of this kid.  Well, I'm gonna babysit a bigger crap out of this kid.  - Ew. - Yeah.  - Hi. - (both gasp)  TINA: Hey, Kendra.  Mr. Boom Boom, one of them will be  my regular babysitter.  (demonic voice): And one of them won't.  - What - Um, that's right, Kendra,  and Mr. Boom Boom.  (normal voice): So this is kind of like a contest.  - (demonic voice): Mm-hmm. - (normal voice): Hmm.  What should we make them do first?  (demonic voice): Oh (grunting)  What about a dance contest?  Kendra, I don't know if this is  - Dance! - Okay, okay.  (both humming nervously)  LINDA: Aw, look at our fancy family.  Ooh, I got to take a leak.  Bobby, if the waiter comes,  order me the salmon, but tell him  don't make it too fishy or squishy.  She said the same thing at the Fishy Squishery.  We were so embarrassed.  - Is everybody ready? - Uh, yes.  My wife will have the salmon,  and I'll have the burger.  Great. Our chef suggests medium rare for the burger.  - (gasps) - Okay. I mean,  that's what I was gonna say.  Oh, good.  So, I guess, tell the chef  that I agree with him.  He'll be so happy.  Hey, wha huh?  GENE: Be a lamb and put me down  for the lamb shank.  A little shanky-panky.  And when you serve it to me, refer to it as ""shanky-panky.""  And I'll take that chicken thing. Looks great.  Dad, Gene and I are going to go, um, explore.  You know us kids, so curious about our surroundings.  Shanky-panky!  - (toilet flushes) -  And that's how you pee   In a restaurant, bum bum.   (sniffs) Ooh, little ripe.  I think I might have some deodorant.  Mints, gum, lotion, tampons.  A bunch of Gene's old baby teeth.  Oh, I'm not a  Huh.  Could I get a burger to go, please?  As quickly as possible.  Okay. I'll just take your menu.  - Mm-mm. Mm-mm. - Just give yeah.  - (struggling) - (grunts)  Okay then.  - Hey, Teddy. Hello. - (yells)  - Gene, Louise. - Yep.  Big time.  I thought date night got changed to tomorrow night.  Does Bob know I'm here?  Bob doesn't know anything about anything.  Ordered the burger, huh?  I just had to try it, okay? I swear,  I've never done this kind of thing before.  Okay, a few times at a few restaurants  on numerous occasions, but those meant nothing to me.  And then you walked back into our place  smelling like guilt and other people's buns.  Oh, God.  Teddy, honey, baby,  no one has to know about this  if, um, I don't know,  you know, a chocolate cake to-go shows up,  distracts me from saying anything.  Make that two.  And I wouldn't say nay to a crÃ©me brÃ»lÃ©e.  KENDRA: Green light!  - Red light. Green light. - (both gasp)  Red light!  (demonic voice): Tina moved.  - No, he's lying! - Ha!  What's the score, Mr. Boom Boom?  (demonic voice): They're all tied it's intense.  I want to play hide-and-seek. You guys go hide.  (demonic voice): And don't let this one find you first.  - She's crazy. - (laughs)  - Um, Mr. Boom Boom, you are so - (laughing demonically)  -  cute. - Run !  (both gasping, panting) One, two,  three  (both whimpering)  (continues whimpering)  Pretty good spot. No one looks under a bed.  Why would you? Hmm.  ""Kendra's secret stuff. Not letters from school.""  Might just sneak a peek.  ""Dear Mr. and Mrs. Stokes, today on the playground,  Kendra kicked Laurie in the "" (gasps)  Tammy? Tammy?  (whispers): What? Tina, go away.  The office is my spot. And also, if my spot  smells like farts, that is not me.  Tammy Ugh! That's strong.  - It wasn't me. - I found a box under Kendra's bed,  and it's full of incident reports from her school.  She must have hidden them from her parents.  She's not being bullied.  She is the bully.  She's the crotch kicker.  That totally makes sense. She's super weird.  (door rattles) Kendra?  (gasps) It's his office.  - (clears throat) - (both gasp)  You keep doing that!  (chuckles nervously) I enjoy it.  You weren't supposed to look in that box.  But now that you did, you know what I have to do?  Go sit quietly somewhere?  Kick you in  the tinkle-dink!  - (both screaming) - (Kendra grunting)  (both yelling, gasping)  Aah! Doesn't lock.  - (grunting) - She's so strong.  She's got bully strength!  - (phone rings) - Oh, no! That's probably her parents.  - Uh, you hold the door. - Uh-huh. Great!  Hello?  Hi, Chris. Oh, yeah, doing good.  Yep, yep, uh oh, you want to say night-night?  - No! - Oh, look at that. (chuckles nervously)  - (grunting) - She fell fast asleep.  - Oh, Mommy! - Went out like a light.  Kids, huh? (chuckles nervously)  Oh, goodness.  - (shouting) - So, everything's great. Got to go.  Phew! Well, we checked this joint out.  - Seems up to code. - And we didn't see anyone we know,  so that settles that.  Uh-huh. Oh. Uh, a lady's going to the bathroom.  - I'll be right back. - Uh, your-your mom's pretending  to be the bathroom attendant.  It's fine. It's a good date.  And our food's still not here--  I guess 'cause this place is so busy.  Huh. I didn't know restaurants got busy.  I'm trying to get some bread,  but I can't get anybody's attention.  Try opening your top button.  I'm gonna go ask somebody.  No, no. No, Dad, you sit.  Yeah, you look tired. And old.  - Kids, let go of my arm. - (strained grunting)  Let go.  Go back to the table. Let g Teddy?  (yells)  - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh.  Uh, what are you doing?  Oh, I was just I thought I dropped  I thought I had an earring and that I dropped it.  - On the ground. - You had an earring on?  - I thought I had an earring. - Oh.  I was thinking of somebody else  who has an earring.  Okay. So, wait, did you order yet?  'Cause, uh, we're sitting over there.  You could come sit with us.  I mean, I don't really want to invite you,  but I guess I just did.  Right. Yes.  How thoughtful of you.  I-I-I just got to go find my waiter.  Don't follow me!  Paper towel, ma'am?  How's it going in there, hon?  Chance of rain, or thunderstorms?  Kendra? Are you out there?  Mr. Boom Boom? You're awfully quiet.  (doorbell rings)  What are they doing here?  TAMMY: I don't know. Maybe someone texted them and said  that you said to come over for pizza so that Kendra could  tell her parents that you invited boys over,  but, I mean, who would, like, do that?  Tammy!  Hey, Tina. Where's the pizza party?  You invited boys over.  (demonic voice): That's bad.  Tina did it, if anyone asks, like your parents or whatever.  Boys have tinkle-dinkers.  They what? Why does that girl talk like a gremlin?  Kicky, kicky.  - Uh, what's happening? - No! Jimmy Jr.! Your tinkle-dinker!  - (yelling) - (screaming)  - She's a crotch kicker! - She's got us cornered!  Quick! The tree house!  (Kendra panting)  (all grunting)  - Pull up the ladder! - (grunts)  She's pretty scary.  Yeah. She's like my grandma at a yard sale,  going after our junk.  - And the salmon for the lady. - Sorry, I'm back.  We ran out of tampons, so I had to improvise.  Oh. Has Teddy been here the whole time?  The burger for you, sir.  - And your Caesar salad. - Yep. That's what I ordered.  (laughs) Oh  (sighs): Oh, here you are.  Here's your to-go order, sir.  Two desserts and our delicious burger.  - Uh-oh. - I-I don't know what you're talking about!  I told you to meet me in the alley  in two hours wearing all black.  Yeah, but I didn't want to do that, so bye.  Aah! Well, that waiter's clearly insane.  (chuckles): Poor schmuck.  Let me, uh, get that dessert box out of your way.  Mm-hmm. Hey!  That other box seems like it's in your way, too.  Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom. Hmm.  Okay. I think she went inside.  This is the worst pizza party ever.  - There was never any pizza. - (sighs)  I just didn't expect her to be such a monster.  I get it. You said she's new in school.  I been there, boy. It's hard to make friends.  She just rejected them in their crotch  before they reject her in her heart.  - That's beautiful, Zeke. - Preach.  Huh. I hadn't thought of it that way.  So, what do we do now, call her parents,  - or the police? - No.  Julie Andrews wouldn't call any parents.  Julie Andrews would march right back into that house,  and probably make clothes out of all the curtains or something.  Wait, Tina, you're going back in there?  You don't have to go, Tammy; leave this to a professional.  (sighs) I don't want my crotch to get kicked,  but I also don't want you to win anything ever.  Oh! I'm going with you.  Okay. We'll stay here.  Let us know how it turns out.  No, J-Ju! We're in this now!  We're stronger if we stick our crotches together.  Okay, fine.  Wait. I know that I've said this a lot, but this time I mean it.  We should put leaves in our underwear.    It's go time.  Uh-oh. I got twigs in my berries.  Okay. Here we go.  Zeke, I'm scared.  I know, buddy. That's what makes us human.  Somebody call a lamb-ulance, 'cause I killed this thing!  - Teddy? - Yeah?  - I know that's your burger. - No, it's not.  Stop being weird, and eat the burger. Please.  - I don't want to. - Eat the burger.  - I don't want to eat it, Bobby. - Eat it!  - I don't want to eat it! - BOB: Eat the burger!  I'll take a bite! Is this what you want? Huh?  (mouth full): Is this what you want,  - you sick bastard?! - Yes!  (choking, coughing)  I'm fine. I'm fine.  (sobbing loudly)  Oh, God!  I betrayed you,  I betrayed us  with the burger! (sobbing)  God, Teddy, quit making such a big deal out of it.  - I don't care. - LOUISE: Uh  - well, I mean, except when you do. - What?  Well, we do have that rule in our family.  Don't order a burger in front of Dad.  'Cause he's gonna ask you what you think.  Then you have to say how bad it is,  or else he gets all sulky.  You turn into the Incredible Sulk.  (chuckles): What? That's-that's not true.  Do you like it?  - Yuck! No. - It's really bad.  No!  What's the verdict?  - Awful! - Ugh!  - Awful! - Tastes like shoes!  Not bad.  - What? - Get out of here! Are you insane?!  - I hate this! - I wish I was dead!  Huh. I didn't realize that I did that.  Also, your neck is weird. Not to pile on.  (groans) Where is she?  Tell you what, Kendra, this time when you come at me,  I'm gonna do some Brazilian jiu-jitsu  - and roll you into a tiny donut. - Zeke.  Uh-oh. She's behind me, isn't she?  That's her thing.  (demonic voice): Hello.  The jiu-jitsu, Zeke!  Okay, all right, I'll do it!  Zeke, no! Kendra, please, listen,  don't be a bully, it's not good.  The world already has enough bullies.  I mean, we've got Tammy.  Oh, um, whoa, what?  I'm a bully? Tina, you're the one who said  that I would make a bad babysitter, and then  - you called me ""horrible."" - That was pretty harsh, T-bird.  Just because you have glasses doesn't mean you're not a bully.  And just because I'm beautiful doesn't mean  (voice breaks): I don't have feelings.  Oh, wow. This whole time  I pictured myself as the Julie Andrews type,  but maybe I'm more like  The Nazis?  Oh, no. Is there another villain?  Well, anyway, Tammy,  I am sorry I called you ""horrible.""  And I am also sorry that you called me ""horrible.""  Are you guys finished? 'Cause I got my foot  all ready for some kickin'. (grunting)  Kendra, look,  maybe we all have a little bully inside of us.  Maybe when we think people are being mean to us,  it can make us mean.  But even if people are horri difficult,  we have to resist.  We have to try to be nice.  Maybe it'll bring out the nice in other people.  - Right, Tammy? - Ugh!  You talk like homework.  And eventually, Kendra,  when the right person comes along,  maybe you'll find a friend who's not a bear.  No offense, Mr. Boom Boom.  (demonic voice): Do it, do it, do it, kick, kick, kick.  (grunts) Oh, my dink.  (normal voice): Okay, now I'm good.  Wait. One more.  (demonic voice): Oh, Nellie  So, everyone, I-I thought about what you guys said,  and I'm not gonna do that anymore.  I-I don't want to be that guy.  - Oh. Mm-hmm. - Uh-huh. Okay.  Yep. And so that is over.  All right. So, moving on,  I do have some thoughts about the burger,  but I'd like to hear first from Teddy.  So? Teddy?  - Yeah? - What'd you think?  - I - LOUISE: No.  - Mm-mm. Mm-mm. - No, no, no, no, no, no.  Teddy, no. It's a trap.  Teddy, don't listen to them.  I seriously really want to know your opinion.  Uh, uh  I'm not doing the thing that I was doing before.  I really want to know.  - No, I know. Uh - LINDA: Teddy, run.  - So why don't you tell me. - Just run.  Run, Teddy. Run, run. Don't look back. Teddy, go.  TEDDY: I I I I, uh  I hated it?  Yeah? Me, too.  (all sighing, laughing)  - Yeah. - Yeah.  It was it was  - it was a little dry, right? - Yeah, so dry.  The bun was okay, though.  - Teddy, no! - Teddy! Teddy, no!  I have some really bad news.  The gift certificate didn't cover the bill.  You still owe $35.  I got it!  - Is this too tight? - No, it kind of feels good.  (gasps) Oh, no! It's her parents!  Boys! Turn invisible, or drop out the window!  - Let's go window! - Tammy, stall them.  Hi! How was the movie?  Tell me every single plot point.  What was the movie about?  (grunting)  Hey, let's see who can make the funniest faces! Go!  - We just want to look in on Kendra. - (flapping lips)  N-N-No! I mean, yes. Because she's-she's sleeping so beautifully.  Okay, no monsters under there. Kendra wanted me to check.  Oh, she's asleep. That's good. Shh, shh, shh.  (whispers): How was the movie?  Okay, thanks, girls.  Hey, maybe we'll hire you guys as a team again next time.  Well, we did it. And, Tammy,  if we can do that together, then there's nothing  - we can't do together. - Boring. Later, fudge-butt.  (yells)  There's my little Cutie Andrews.  - How'd it go, Tina? - Oh, nothing I couldn't handle.  Speaking of handles, what's, um  - what's going on down there? - Oh, right.  BOB: Okay, that's odd.  GENE: So that's where leaves come from!"
"1    Okay, I think I have it  - all nailed down now. -   If I start the carrots at 11:30 tomorrow,  they should be done right when the turkey  needs its last basting,  and everything will be ready for our noon meal.  Did I tell you guys I'm using a new brine?  - You may have mentioned it. - The brine blogs are going nuts.  I wasn't listening.  - Tell me again. - Gene, no.  Well, you can add orange peel  LINDA/TINA/LOUISE: Orange peel for flavor.  - You told us, Bob. - We know.  Don't overthink it. You get yourself  all wound up, and it's a real turnoff.  Well, it helps to say it out loud so I get it right.  And, you know, most people  would be turned on by a new brine.  (panting): Bob! Bob. Bob.  - Uh, what? - I need your help.  I was supposed to go to my sister's for Thanksgiving,  like I do every year, but now my mom's flying in,  so it's easier for my sister to pick her up  and then come to my place to have dinner!  Oh, how fun.  How many people are you having?  I don't know. My sister, her husband, my mom,  my mom's new, slightly age-inappropriate boyfriend.  It's not fun, Linda. I got to cook and what, uh,  set out plates? Right? Is that what you do?  I don't know how to do any of that stuff!  - You got to come over to help me! - Okay.  Teddy, I don't know. We closed early,  and I still barely have enough time  to do everything I have to do for our Thanksgiving.  I have a new brine I'm trying,  and I-I was thinking about spatchcocking.  Spatchcocking? With those hips? Honey, no.  Gene. It's when you take the backbone out of the turkey  and you press it flat. It cooks more evenly.  I thought women had to deal with unfair body expectations.  Bob, come on, I'm desperate here.  I'm asking you, help me out.  (sighs) All right, well, I-I guess I could write out  some basic instructions for you.  - Write-write-write it up. - Bob, no.  Come on, where's your Turkey Day spirit?  It won't take much time.  We'll come over and help you, Teddy, all right?  (sighs) Fine.  (imitates sad trombone):  Wah-wah.   - Louise. - You're coming, too, Miss Missy.  Many hands make work easier. Or something.  (laughs)  Bwah-bwah  to you, Louise.  Yeah, that's not how it goes. You sound ridiculous.  BOB: Well, we got you a good bird, Teddy.  Almost as good as the one I left at home  that I wish I was with right now.  I miss him. But that's okay.  So, first I'll show you how to do the rub.  I could use a rub.  I'm holding a little spelling test tension right back here.  We're talking about the bird, Gene. We're gonna rub it.  - Fine, I'll go second. - Okay.  So, where are you gonna set up your table?  Here in the middle of the room?  Show us exactly where you want your guests  - to be underwhelmed. - Louise.  Oh, I was just thinking that we'd put everything  - on the coffee table. - Perfect.  - Then we sit on the couch, right? - Very sad.  Okay. And then we pull the chairs over.  - Yeah. - No.  - Right? Nice and cozy, though, right? - Eh.  Tell you what, you and Bob start on the food,  and the kids and I will set up out here, okay?  All right, sounds great.  Okay. I think there are some candles  in the closet here, but stay out of that room.  Nothing much in there just a couple of personal things.  All right, we'll figure it out.  - Go, go learn how to cook. - ""Bam."" Right?  That's what Emeril does. ""Bam""?  - Teddy, go! - Right?  - Go. - Okay, right. Yes, going.  Huh. Lot of stuff.  LOUISE: Like unopened, blank VHS tapes.  TINA: And old thermometers.  If those tips could talk.  Kids, don't touch those. Put that stuff back.  Let's keep looking for the candles.  Don't touch anything gross.  Okay, Teddy, Thanksgiving is  the most important meal of the year,  which makes the turkey, like, the king of foods.  (sings fanfare) Here he comes, right?  - Yep, the king. - Okay. Got it.  All right. And the trick is, with the rubs,  - is to go under the skin. All right? - Yep.  - So you start at the bottom, - Yeah.  And then you massage in the rub  - and gently make your way to the neck. - Wow.  - Yeah. Think of the meat as the canvas - Oh.  - And the rub as the paint. - Lot of metaphors, Bobby.  You know what? I'm already doing it,  - so I'll-I'll just finish. - Right. You finish.  - Yeah. - Because I'm  It's actually making me sick. Is that normal?  I'll tell you what, you can start peeling the carrots if you want.  - One less thing to do tomorrow. - Right, right.  - On it. Give me space. - All right. Good. Yep.  Okay, just grab the peeler right there  - and peel the carrots. - This?  That's the spatula.  I knew that. (laughs) This?  (chuckles) Th-That's a ladle.  The I-It's that thing right next to the carrots.  - This? - That's the spatula again.  - It's - No, right. Yes. Right.  It's right there. It's the only thing  that looks like it could peel a carrot.  Right. Why didn't you just say that?  - Oh, my God. - (chuckles)  - I'm not an idiot. - You're holding the blade.  - No, I got it. Right. - You're holding the blade.  - Hold the handle. Teddy. - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!  - Easy. Easy. Easy. - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!  - Uh-oh. Uh, you know what? - Ow. How do you Ow. Ow.  Once I'm done with the rub, we'll put this in the fridge,  - and I'll help you with that. - Is this peeled enough?  (chuckles): It's not peeled at all.  Still no candles.  But lots of chopsticks.  Maybe we can arrange them like candles?  If we soak 'em in gas, they'll burn real pretty.  (sighs) Never mind, it's filled with pennies.  So am I. You don't hear me bragging about it.  Let's check in here.  But Teddy said not to go in there.  He's probably hiding something creepy,  like a dead body or an indoor hot tub.  Ah, let's just take a little peek.  (gasps)  - KIDS: Whoa. - Oh, my God!  Teddy's a hoarder.  Oh, so, just snap off the tops, huh?  Th-That's it. Nice and easy.  - Off with their heads. (laughs) - (chuckles)  Eh. Bob, open up.  Ugh. That's the that's the part you don't eat.  - You do it. - Ah  Mmm, those are good. Give me the other one.  BOB: So, tomorrow, you just take this guy out  - and put him in the oven for - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Don't say another word. I'm gonna write it all down.  Let me get some paper.  - (screams) - Teddy?  - Aah. - What the ?  - Uh, surprise. - Oh. Oh.  We found your dining room.  - Aah. - We're cleaning it out  so you can have Thanksgiving dinner in there.  What? No, that's a storage room.  Oh, whoa.  But we found a dining table under all of the stuff.  Oh, and it's a beaut.  Look at those legs.  - I'd let that hold my turkey. - Right?  Yep. And Gene, Louise and I  are trying to see who can find the best thing.  How do you decide what the best thing is?  You know it when you see it.  I'm the front-runner with that Gerald Ford bobble-head  that doesn't bobble.  - Knock, knock. - Who's there?  - A box of doorknobs. - A box of doorknobs who?  Teddy has a box of doorknobs for some reason.  - New front-runner. - (chuckles nervously)  Oh, good knock-knock.  Okay, now let's-let's get all that stuff back.  Come on, guys. That'll be fun, right?  Put all the Put the put that stuff back  and just close the doors! Ow!  Oh, I think that ship has sailed, Teddy.  Yeah, it would take us  just as long to put everything back  as it would to fix up the dining room.  Where you'll have the best Thanksgiving ever   You're welcome.  (vocalizing)  - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.  I can't believe all of this was in one room.  You guys weren't supposed to see it.  I can't wait to grow up and get my own place  with a room full of newspapers and engine parts and  what is this, some sort of hookah?  - It's an aquarium pump. - Do you have an aquarium?  No. I was gonna get the pump working  and then go from there.  Hmm. Want to talk about the two-legged chairs?  - No, I do not. - Uh, Linda,  can I have a word with you in the kitchen?  (quietly): Are we sure we want to get into this?  Teddy is a hoarder.  I-I mean, I thought he had so little,  but he has too much.  Exactly, Bob.  And that hoarder needs our help.  Shouldn't we call a doctor or a TV show?  Bob, he's our friend.  We need to be here for him, okay?  Lin, we came here to help him  cook his Thanksgiving dinner, and we did that.  We don't have time to de-hoard his dining room.  But the dining room is part of Thanksgiving.  And when he sits at that table and he says what he's thankful for,  he'll say, ""Linda.  And the rest of those darn Belchers.""  - (sighs) Uh, fine. - Oh, your breath.  - (groaning nervously) - Okay, Teddy, all we have to do is get  - rid of some of this stuff, right? - What?!  I-I mean, we're gonna change the location of some of it  from inside your house to not inside your house.  Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.  And you can have a nice Thanksgiving  with your family at the dining room table.  The living room is nice enough.  Plus, there's a big stain on the table.  Yeah, how'd that get there?  I sanded it down to refinish it, but then I started working  on this cuckoo clock to fix that.  And then the cuckoo scared me,  and I spat grape juice everywhere.  If we find that son of a bitch cuckoo, I call it for best thing.  Ah, well, that's what tablecloths are for.  Tablecloth? What's a tablecloth?  How about a sheet?  I can't do that. I just have the one on my bed.  And that one's probably got enough food stains on it.  Well, kids, call time-out on your little game.  Find something we can use as a runner  to cover up the stain on the table, okay?  Teddy, I might regret asking this,  but why do you have all this stuff?  It's not ""stuff,"" Bob. It's things.  Mm-hmm. -Things I'm fixing up. I'm a handyman, you know.  Right. And I'm a cook,  but I don't keep 600 pounds of food in my dining room.  N-Never mind. You're You'll be fine.  I-I'm gonna write down instructions for your dinner.  Okay, Teddy, I heard of a technique  for de-cluttering where you hold something up  and you ask, ""Does this love me?""  Go on.  Does this stool love me? Yes.  But is it in love with you?  Teddy and a stool, sitting in a tree  T-R-E-E-E-E-E.  Kids, shh-shh.  What about this?  An old telephone without a receiver.  That loves me. It really does.  Like, almost too much. It's embarrassing.  Okay, I'll tell you what.  I'm gonna put these into piles  that I think will help you decide  whether or not they love you, okay?  What are we gonna do with all the stuff that doesn't love him?  Burn it? In the alley?  Maybe. No.  Teddy, can you get a Dumpster over here?  Whoa, whoa, whoa. A Dumpster?  I was thinking, like, maybe just a couple of armloads of stuff.  Maybe a small shopping bag.  See if we get that filled up.  Teddy, look at all this. It's a lot.  I know, but getting a Dumpster on such short notice?  The permits, the red tape What am I supposed to do,  just call the Dumpster Fairy?  You know construction people, right?  I guess I could call Dennis.  Is Dennis the Dumpster Fairy?  Or our fairy god-Dumpster?  All right, I'm gonna go call him from the bedroom  so you can't hear me swearing about all this.  - Could we use this as the runner? - Eh.  - It's not very Thanksgivingy. -   GENE: The back is a festive beige.  Yeah, I guess that could work.  All right, go get plates and silverware  from the kitchen and set up the table.  Okay, Dennis is bringing a Dumpster by in a little while.  Oh, good!  He says he's gonna borrow it from a job site,  but it already has some stuff in it.  And if anyone comes and asks anything about it,  we're supposed to say, ""Vinny said it was okay.""  Great.  And if they say, ""Vinny's out of the joint?""  we say, ""Yeah, Vinny's out, and he's got big plans.""  - Okay. - Not a whole lot of plates  - and only one fork. - Hmm.  There's plastic utensils and paper plates  from takeout in the drawer next to the sink.  I knew I was saving those for something.  You kids do that, and I'll keep going with Teddy.  Okay, Teddy. Does this love you?  - Yes. - Wrong.  GENE: You're mistaking lust for love.  Oh, the Dumpster's here. It's here.  I can't look. I mean, I'm gonna go back in the kitchen  - and see what Bob's doing. - Okay, I'll handle it.  - Do I tip or ? What, what - Tip your fake hat  and say, ""Thank you, milady.""  Okay, Teddy. I-I did all the work  All of it and wrote down  exactly when you're supposed to put these in the oven.  It's foolproof.  TEDDY: ""Put in oven at 2:00 for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.""  Right? Is that a five or an ""S""?  It's a five. You just said it.  350 degrees. Why-why would it be an ""S""?  I don't know. I'm nervous, Bob! I'm freaking out here!  (sighs) Why are you so nervous? It's just your family.  I know, but I've never hosted before.  And everything was all put away and now it's everywhere.  And it's different. I'm just nervous.  - I'm gonna go get my camera. - Your camera? Why?  Okay, I'm back, ha-ha. Uh, pick up a dish  and act like you're putting it in the oven.  - Teddy, this is crazy. - I'm a visual learner.  - It doesn't make any sense! - Come on, Bobby, help me out!  Just pretend like you're putting those carrots in the oven.  - Fine! How does my hair look?  - It-it's a little messy.  Can you push it over to the ?  - Push it the other way. - Just take the picture!  - Come on, just push it the other way. - No.  That's how you want to represent yourself cooking?  You're right, let me fix it.  LINDA: Bob, Teddy, come out here please!  Okay, this is the pile that loves Teddy.  This is the pile that likes him, but is ready to move on.  And this pile hates him.  - Hates him. - Okay, what's the fourth pile?  - LINDA: Oh, that stuff loves me. - Loves her.  - I'm keeping that. - Huh.  So everyone grab as much as you can from these two piles,  and let's take 'em to the Dumpster!  I call the light-bulbs. I promise I'll be super,  super gentle when I throw them in the Dumpster  - as hard as I can. - (Teddy groans)  And I call this Magic 8-Ball with all the water drained out.  - New best thing! Beat that! - Impossible.  Hmm. My outlook for beating that is not so good.  Isn't this great?  So nice and clean?  And your dining room looks so beautiful.  Yeah. It is (stammers)  I sure don't need all those things that we put in the Dumpster.  - This is better. - That's right.  - This is so much better. - There he is.  This is a very, very great Nice job, everybody.  - Attaboy, attaboy. - Right. Yup. - Nice job.  Well, glad we could help, so we should probably go, right?  - Okay. - Good luck tomorrow, Teddy.  Who needs luck when I got these Polaroids? Ah.  GENE: That was a good 'un, Pa.  TINA: I'm a tryp-to-fan of what you did with this turkey.  - Get it? - It was so good and I ate so much,  - I can't even finish this - Pie?  Well, I was going to say ""sentence.""  - Eh, it was fine, I guess. - What?  The-the turkey was a little dry.  That's why God invented gravy.  Or as I call it, turkey lube.  You're crazy, Bob. It was good.  And the timing of the yams was off.  They were a little cold by the time everything else was done.  Who cares? It's all the same temperature in here  98 degrees ""Fartenheit.""  (sighs) I really wish I had spatchcocked the turkey.  We-we spent so much time at Teddy's,  I-I didn't have time to get into it.  Teddy's so lucky to have friends like us.  I wonder how he's doing over there.  If he's following my very clear instructions,  - then he should be doing just fine. - (phone rings)  Probably better than I did.  Hello.  Bob! I'm looking at your notes,  but the pictures don't match and the green beans are burning,  or they're already burnt, and I didn't know  if I was supposed to start the turkey yet.  - It's Teddy. He's not doing well. - (Teddy shouting)  Wait a minute, I messed up our Thanksgiving.  Teddy's sounds like a disaster.  - You know what this means? - Please don't say  LOUISE/BOB: We have to go to Teddy's  to help him with his Thanksgiving,  - so I can redeem myself. - So you can redeem yourself.  - Oh, God. - (Teddy shouting)  Thanks for coming! Happy Thanksgiving! What took you so long?!  BOB: Teddy, uh, wh-what happened to you?  What? When? What? Yes.  You look like you just got beat up by an Edward Scissorhand.  I was rushing around, trying to get everything ready for today,  and I caught my shirt on the dresser handle,  and I turned around to look what happened  and I went smack, right into the door!  Oh. What happened to your cheek?  I was trying to shave with an old razor.  I tried to tough it out, but I  But it just got more and more painful, so I stopped.  Is it noticeable?  Yeah, but you're making it work.  I smell something funky.  (sniffs) Ew. What is that?  Eh, it's probably me. I get panic stink.  - I-I don't think that's a real thing. - It is.  Oh, it's real.  What? It just smells kind of like my locker.  - Oh, no. - And now you know.  Well, uh, maybe-maybe take a shower.  I already had two. It just spreads the smell around.  Well, once I get the food going,  all anyone will smell is delicious turkey.  Time to take back Thanksgiving!  Get ready for Turkey 2: Judgment Day!  All right, let me get you a new shirt and, uh,  maybe wipe the blood off your face.  Oh, wait. What about some place cards for the table?  That would spruce this sucker up a little.  Good one, T.  Teddy, I'll go grab you a shirt.  Can you write in cursive?  Yeah, but this seems like a bubble letter situation.  - A BLS. - So what are the names of your family?  My sister and her husband are Dana and Dan.  Just put ""Mom"" for my mom She'll know what that means.  And her boyfriend, oh, uh, have I never used his name?  Me and my sister just call him Boy-toy,  but we can't write that. Can we write that?!  - Yeah. - No, no, no, no.  Let's just take a shot and go with Terry.  Okay, here you go. Just slip this on.  - Thanks, Linda. - Oh, the smell.  Here, I brought some aftershave for that.  Ooh. Now let me just flick your pits.  - Ha! Flick it. - Right. Yeah, put it in there.  Okay. All right.  - And a little on the cheeks. - (Teddy screams)  - It burns! It burns! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Ah. Oh, it stopped.  So where should we put these bad boys?  Definitely put my sister next to her husband,  and my mom next to ""Terry.""  But who should I sit between?  Well, how do you usually do it?  Well, when I was a kid, I'd just sit between my parents,  - so they wouldn't argue so much. - Did it work?  Sometimes. But, boy, could they yell.  They would yell and yell,  and then my neighbors would yell, ""Shut up!""  And my mom would yell back,  ""Mind your own business, Finelli's,  because you had problems last week!""  BOB: Linda, can I get a hand in here?  Teddy, hold that sad thought for one sec. I'll be right back.  Would you, uh, give the potatoes a stir?  - I'm - I'm covered in poultry. - Okay.  Oh, God, what are you doing?  I-I'm taking out the backbone.  It's how you get the turkey flat for spatchcocking.  - What? - I-I thought you'd want to see me do it.  (gags)  Why is everyone so disgusted by turkey preparation?  - It's beautiful. - No.  Okay, but just watch this, Lin. I have to crack the chest.  (grunting): You have to be pretty strong to do this.  Good thing I spatchcock!  - Oh, my face! - Did I get ya?  - Did ya get - Yes! Oh, right in my mouth.  Oh, wash it off quick. That's  Ugh, give me some wine. Give me some wine.  - Oh. Yeah. - Give me the wine. Oh, oh.  (spits) Ugh. Mmm. Good wine.  Good news, Teddy. The dinner will be ready  right before your family arrives and it's gonna be perfect!  Teddy?  Kids, have you seen Teddy?  - Not lately. - We invited Teddy to join us  on the floor, but he hasn't RSVP'd.  We're taking a little table-setting break.  You know, we just ate an entire Thanksgiving meal  and now you're making us do stuff, right?  - Teddy! - Teddy, where are you?  Is he in the bathroom? Knock, knock.  No. Why does he need five plungers?  GENE: For different moods.  Oh, my God. Teddy's family  is on their way, and he's missing.  This is awful!  Oh, that's good.  We looked in every room, twice.  Where could Teddy have gone?  Did you try tapping his food bowl?  This is bad. His family's coming  and the perfect turkey's in the oven.  He can't have gone far; let's check outside.  Teddy! Teddy!  - Teddy! - Here, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.  - (thud) - Teddy? Is that you?  - TEDDY: No. - Okay, sorry to bother you.  Where is he?  (Teddy grunting)  Hey, Teddy, what are you doing?  Fixing the chair, obviously.  Don't know how it got in here; it's perfectly good.  Uh, okay, but is this a good time to do that?  It's a great time. I'm just fixing a couple of things.  Maybe I'm gonna move 'em upstairs if I want to.  Or it might be easier to just move a couple things  from upstairs down here, live in the Dumpster.  - Cheaper rent. - Great light.  Kids, no. Teddy's not living in the Dumpster.  Yeah, Teddy. This stuff is going to the dump.  A-And you need to come upstairs.  This can't go to the dump, Bob. It's not trash.  All this stuff can be fixed.  You don't just give up on stuff; you can fix it.  It might be okay to give up on the half a waffle maker.  I'm saving that until I find the other half.  I'm a fixer, I fix things.  I've always been a fixer.  I'm gonna fix that waffle maker soon.  (gasps) Oh, my God, I'm having a brain-smart.  Teddy, you sat between your parents  when they would argue.  You were the peacemaker.  - You were trying to fix things. - Oh, yeah.  Your mom and dad are the two halves of the waffle maker.  That makes you a waffle.  It's probably why you like butter so much.  Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry.  We did this all too fast.  We pushed you too hard.  (sniffling) Yeah. You were just trying to help.  In kind of a judgey way.  Well, if keeping stuff to fix  helps get you through the day, then what's the big deal?  It isn't hurting anybody, right?  Yeah, we all have our things.  Dad gets weird about Thanksgiving.  I-I don't get weird.  - I care too much, Tina be shopping. - What?  - Mom has her wine. - Oh, there it is. Thank you, Gene.  But this isn't my thing.  I mean, Thanksgiving happens once a year.  It's not weird to try and make it perfect.  - You guys are weird. - (phone rings)  Hello.  Oh, hey. Nothing.  What do you mean it sounds like I'm in a Dumpster?  It's just kinda echo-y in here because of my couch.  Oh. It did? Yeah, that happens.  Okay, then I-I guess I'll see you guys tomorrow.  That was my sister.  My mom missed her flight,  and now my sister is staying near the airport  so she can pick her up in the morning.  - Oh, no. - Oh.  No. This is great.  I'm off the hook. Them coming tomorrow is better.  - Tomorrow's better? - Tomorrow's way better.  No pressure for a perfect meal or perfect setting.  We'll just hang out.  Uh, I-I guess it's-it's great.  Just, um, that was a lot of work,  completely for nothing.  I'll get over it.  But, Teddy, now you're alone on Thanksgiving.  I'm fine. I'm just gonna bring some of my stuff back upstairs.  Wait, the turkey's gonna be ready in an hour,  and you have a whole Thanksgiving dinner up there,  and, you know, we're here, so  Oh. Hey, then why don't you join me?  - We already ate. - Oh, we, uh  - Yeah, that's a good idea, Teddy. - Mm.  Thank you. I mean, we might as well stay, right?  Aw, and we'll help you carry the stuff you want back up.  - Whoa. Whoa. - I'm with her.  Yeah, my arms are pretty tired from writing the place cards.  Kids, we're helping him. Grab something.  Hey, look, the other half of the waffle maker.  - You found it. - (gasps) New best thing.  - I win! - What?  No. Drained 8-Ball.  - Yeah, you're right. - Yeah.  TINA: Ow.  BOB: We gotta get out of this Dumpster.  Well, that was the last of it.  The stuff you wanna keep is back where it was. And then some.  Okay, my redemption dinner is served.  Wait, did you bring broken chunks of concrete up here?  Yeah, that's good rebar.  You just break off the concrete and voilÃ .  - Free rebar. - Free-bar.  O-Okay. Well, let's eat while everything's hot.  It does smell good. Guess I could have a bite.  I could take a nibble.  If this is how I go, this is how I go.  Thank you guys for all your help with my stuff.  And putting up with my stuff.  And making stuffing.  - It means a lot. - Of course.  Okay, everyone, let's focus on the food.  I mean, we're all here for Teddy, of course, but dig in.  Oh. (inhales) Mmm, Bobby.  This is really good.  (mouth full): Mmm. This is amazing, Bob.  (voice breaking): Mmm. It really is.  - Are you crying? - No.  I'm-I'm I'm just so happy.  GENE: This is so good I'm gonna wish for  a second stomach. Where's the wishbone?  TINA: I think the spatchcocking broke it.  TEDDY: I can fix it!  LINDA:  An aquarium pump don't belong in the dump   Give it to Teddy   - TEDDY: I can fix it! - LINDA:  Who really cares   About two-legged chairs? No one but Teddy   - TEDDY: I can fix it! - LINDA:  A phone with no receiver   Should be chopped up with a cleaver, 'less you're Teddy   - TEDDY: I can fix it! -  But is a Gerald Ford bobble-head   That doesn't really bobble worth your trouble?   TEDDY: I can fix it!  My parents were the two halves of the waffle maker   BELCHERS:  That makes you the waffle   TEDDY:  My parents were the two halves of the waffle maker   BELCHERS:  That makes you the waffle   TEDDY:  My parents were the two halves of the waffle maker   BELCHERS:  That makes you the waffle   TEDDY:  My parents were the two halves of the waffle maker   BELCHERS:  That makes you the waffle."
"1   (snoring)  (groans)  (""Carol of the Bells"" playing)  (gasps) Bob! Bobby! Bob! Bob!  What? What's happening? What?  - I got it. - You got what? Wait. What time is it?  I just had a dream that we threw  the most incredible Christmas party ever thrown.  It was perfect.  And now I know what we have to do.  (yawning): Go back to sleep?  No, no. Listen, listen.  It just hasn't felt like Christmas this year.  I mean, I've got the spirit, but people seem so sad.  Look, I know money's tight.  I know it's been a tough year and that guy died,  the guy that was in that show.  Yeah, that was sad.  But it's the holidays.  Mm, okay. Good night.  I think my dream was trying to tell me something.  I think we're supposed to spread cheer and save Christmas.  So, we should throw the party from my dream at the restaurant.  - Um, when? - Today. This afternoon.  The sooner the better.  Okay, but let's not go crazy.  We still have to wrap all our presents  - and shop for a couple more. - No, no.  This party has to be magical, Bobby, just like my dream.  In my dream, you were there   Wearing your Christmas best   In my dream   The whole town was there   Saying this year's been a mess   But the eggnog flowed like a river   And it made people reconsider   And come together for something bigger   It's the Christmas of my   Dreams   Doesn't that sound nice?  Bob, write this stuff down.  We'll need all of it for the party.  Lin, I'm really tired.  We'll need five meat-carving stations   I'll just make burgers   Guests from far away nations   I bet Teddy will come   We'll need an ice-skating rink   Everyone will wear skates   Mr. Present greets guests with a smile on his face   Mr. Present sounds nice.  In the Christmas of my   Dreams.   Oh, it's gonna be great.  Lin, can I please have the blanket?  Are those new underwear? Those are nice.  Mm, no, they're old, but thanks for noticing.  So, a dream told Mom that we should throw  a Christmas party at the restaurant?  That's right. We're gonna spread a little Christmas cheer.  I had a dream Dad had a ponytail.  Should we just do that instead?  Hang on, hang on. Shush.  I'm standing outside The Wiggle Room  where earlier this morning,  club patrons went from tearing the roof off  this popular gay nightclub to watching the city  tear the actual roof off this popular gay nightclub.  This club has been in violation  of multiple city codes for a long time.  Noise violations, un-permitted stages  and more than one illegal seesaw.  Damn the man.  Bros before city codes.  So it looks like these tiny dancers  will hold each other closer this holiday season,  making this cheery time of year a little more tear-y  for this community.  - (Linda gasping) - Hmm.  (Linda grunting)  - Mother seems well. - Lin, why are you  cutting off the top of the tree?  I'm just gonna borrow a little bit from our tree  and make a mini one for the restaurant.  She's circumcising our tree.  Did you see that news story?  This Christmas is gonna be sad  if we don't put in the extra effort.  (grunts)  Okay, so, our tree looks exactly how it looks right now  'cause of what you just did.  Oh, you could barely tell.  Plus, I'll just reattach it.  It'll grow back together and done.  Yeah, that sounds right.  This little guy has to be special,  so I'm gonna relocate some of my favorite ornaments.  Aw, I remember when Gene made me this one.  Oh, my God, I love it.  And Tina made me this one.  Oh, my God, I love it.  And Louise made me this one.  Oh, my God, I love it!  Frankly, you know, I'm a little more interested  in what's going under the tree if you catch my drift.  Yes, Louise, we got the link to your online gift registry.  I noticed a lot of the big-ticket items  were still available, so  Aw, look at our little tree.  I love my mini tree.  I'm gonna fill it up with more ornaments  and then I'm gonna go invite everyone to the party.    Happy holidays.  Here's a Santa Slider.  (laughs) 'Cause it's Christmas, right?  Yup. -I'm just gonna start grabbing these  and you let me know when I've taken an appropriate amount.  - Oh, okay, stop, Teddy. - So, just, so, just four then?  Every time you come by?  We're gonna be seeing a lot of each other, Bobby.  - Hmm. - (groans)  Would you like a Santa Slider, Mort?  Ooh, the last one.  Room temperature and everybody's touched it.  No, no, no. It's pretty fresh and-and no one's touched it,  - except maybe Teddy. - I grazed it.  I'll wait for a fresh batch.  What's your problem, Mort? (mouth full): Just take it.  Fine, I'll take it.  Ow! Ow! Ow!  Just kidding. It's ice cold.  Did you see my little tree?  I put all my favorite ornaments on it.  And the tree topper is a little porcelain baby angel  and he's smiling 'cause he's on top of the tree.  Can we just have the eggnog?  I like it. I like your ornaments.  - But we're gonna go on the other side of the room now. - Oh.  So, what do you think? Santa coming this year or what?  Have you been good? I hope the Bleaken doesn't come.  Who and/or what is the Bleaken?  You kids don't know about the Bleaken?  Is it a band? Are they on SoundCloud?  He's got, like, different names in different cultures,  but he's basically the anti-Santa.  LOUISE: You got our attention. Go on.  TEDDY: The Bleaken is a horned creature  with lizard skin and black feathers  who comes every once in a while.  - TINA: Every once in a while? - GENE: Like El NiÃ±o?  TEDDY: My Nana used to say he feeds off sadness and anger.  She said when me and my sister would fight,  it meant the Bleaken would come.  Nana sounds fun.  Is Nana short for banana?  Well, what happens when the Bleaken comes?  TEDDY: The Bleaken steals your presents.  - LOUISE: What?! - TEDDY: Yup.  Then he takes them back to his lair  and you never see them again.  And one time, I thought, I thought I saw him.  Wait, you saw the Bleaken?  I don't know. I was little.  Nana used to give us wine.  You're freaking us out.  Keep your weird Nana stuff to yourself.  Yeah, the Bleaken's probably just an old story.  - And a long story. Am I right? Eh? - (door bells jingle)  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Now it's a party. (laughs)  Yeah, 'cause Jimmy's here and me.  And damn it, Trev, do not say stuff.  What do you mean don't say stuff? What-what am I supposed to say?  - Just shush-ish. - Uh, but  Hi, Jimmy. Hi, Trev.  Happy holidays.  Lin, you invited Jimmy?  It's a Christmas ceasefire, Bob, a truce for the holidays.  Yeah, Bob. Try to be the bigger man for once, huh?  That shouldn't be too hard because of your butt!  It's big. (laughs)  - Zoom. - Hmm. Mm-hmm.  I'm not saying nothing.  - Come on. - No.  - Come on. - No.  - Come on. - All right.  (laughs) Nice.  Hmm. Well, Merry Christmas.  Stupid Jimmy Pesto.  Thanks for coming, Dalton. Merry Christmas.  Oh, my God, Linda, this tastes like mouthwash with eggs in it.  I love it. You're so sweet.  Do you literally have anything else to drink?  Uh, I-I could open up some champagne.  Ugh, you're a peach.  I'm going to drink my way through the holidays.  Wait, what do you mean? Like in a fun way?  Ask my ex-boyfriend, then ask his new boyfriend  and then ask his new boyfriend's ex-boyfriend.  Oh, wait, that's me.  Oh. Sorry. I think.  I got lost.  Well, happy holidays. (whoops)  Yay.  That Bleaken stuff, I don't know.  I feel it.  I think the Bleaken is coming this year.  You know what I mean?  Doesn't it just seem, like, cold and gray?  - Look outside. - It's winter.  If you believe the media.  - Hey, Bob. - Hi, Marshmallow.  Hey, Marshmallow. Who's your friend?  This is Art. He's an artist.  Well, art I glad to meet you, Art.  Hmm. Maybe we should go.  It's fine. I'm easily amused. (chuckles)  Ha, easily, I get it.  Marshmallow, I heard The Wiggle Room closed.  Didn't you used to go there? I'm so sorry.  I don't know if I'll ever wiggle again.  Well, maybe some eggnog will cheer you up?  Thanks, baby.  - Oh, that's nasty. - Merry Christmas.  Thanks for coming.  So nice to see you.  All right. Happy holidays.  Happy holidays. Yeah.  It's the Christmas of my dreams.   - Sorry, what? - Nothing, nothing.  I ooh, it's cold out.  Well, did we save Christmas?  I mean, it wasn't as big as the party in my dream  and Mr. Present didn't come,  but I think we did our part to spread a little holiday cheer.  And my little tree looks so good.  - Oh, my God! - Lin, what's wrong?  Aah, my tree! My tree is gone!  (gasps) My ornaments.  All my favorite ornaments.  - (gags) - Wait, where is it?  Kids, did you move Mom's little tree?  - I didn't. - Nope.  - No. - Oh, my God.  - Oh, my God! (gags) - Oh, my God.  (growls) Who would steal a Christmas tree  It's Christmas. Oh, right. That kind of makes sense.  My favorite ornaments. My little babies.  - I know, it's - I'm gonna faint.  I know it's awful, Lin,  but-but try and calm down.  I mean, you already called the police.  - Three times. - I say call back  and this time, you hang up on them.  I say call that new Vietnamese place  and order just a ton of beef bÃ¡nh mis.  I came as quickly as I could after I did some other stuff.  - So what was stolen? - My little Christmas tree.  Technically, it was just the top of the Christmas tree.  - Just the tip. - Gene.  It had all my favorite ornaments on it.  - My kids made most of them. - I have one question.  Did the thief steal your kids' hands?  - No. - Good.  Kids, make your mom some new ornaments  and quit wasting my time.  Sergeant Bosco, please.  Let me tell you something.  I've learned one thing in law enforcement.  People are awful and Christmas makes them worse.  There's been a rash of little thefts like this all over town.  What's been stolen?  A lot of Christmas crap.  Lights, plastic reindeer,  a bunch of those inflatable Santa Clauses.  - I have one of those. - Of course you do.  Well, I wouldn't put it out this year.  Wait, I already did.  Do you have any leads? Any suspects?  Yeah, some guy or girl,  or a group of guys and girls.  Bye, I'm leaving.  (sighs) I'm sorry, Lin.  He-he wasn't really helpful.  But maybe let's do like he said  and have the kids make some new ornaments.  I don't want new ornaments, Bob.  I want the ornaments from when they were young and cute,  not from now.  Hey, I'm adorable.  You know what? We don't need Bosco.  Whoever took my tree was a guest at our party.  We know who all the suspects are.  We just have to go talk to them.  Lin, Christmas is in three days.  Are-are you sure this is  I'm finding my ornaments, Bob!  Oh, whoa. Fine.  But we can't get too carried away, right?  Or we let Mom solve every crime in town.  Like Kyra Sedgwick or Mariska Hargitay-tag-gahh.  Okay, here it is. This is everyone who was at our party.  I already crossed you, the kids, Teddy and Mort off the list.  Hmm, I don't know. Mort was a little annoyed  that he had to take the last slider on the tray.  Ooh, motive.  Okay, Mort's back on the list.  But maybe we should start with the more obvious suspects.  I think I might know one.  LINDA: Jimmy Pesto.  Come on, let's go grill him!  - (grunts) - Wait, Lin, I'll go with you,  but let's try not to let this get out of hand.  Oh, I won't go overboard.  Now let's go toss that pizza man.  - I'm going to get my coat. - What should we do?  We should probably go with you guys.  You could use the extra muscle.  No, no, no, we'll close for a little while.  You kids go upstairs and make your mom and me  - some of those coupon books that - You love so much?  No, I was gonna say that you never seem to honor.  Well, you wanted us to honor them?  I guess it's not the thought that counts.  - (knocking) - Bob, come on!  Heh-ho! Look what the fart dragged in!  - (laughing) - Can it, Pesto.  I know you did it. Where are you hiding it?  What are you yelling about?  We're in-investigating a crime.  She's following up on a lead.  Oh, no. Did someone steal all of your customers?  Wait. That was me! (laughs)  (laughs) He's talking about your livelihood.  No, Jimmy. Somebody stole my little Christmas tree  from the holiday party, and I think  you know exactly who stole it because it was you!  What? Well, why would I want your dumb tree?  I thought maybe, uh, you came over here  - because you found the fudge. - Fudge? What fudge?  I took some fudge from the snack table  at your party and put it in the urinal. (laughs)  So it looked like someone pooped!  (both laugh)  So, there was really no reason to stay after that,  and we left. Doodly doo.  Huh. You did leave kind of early.  The tree wasn't stolen till later.  Well, Lin, I think it's obvious that Jimmy is an idiot.  - Yeah? - But I don't think he did it.  Um, I don't think an idiot would put fudge in a urinal.  Yeah, maybe we can cross him off the list.  Wait. Security cameras.  BOB: Jimmy's camera doesn't point at our restaurant.  Yeah, why would I want to do that? What?  Is America's Most Boring and Sad Videos still on the air?  (laughs)  That was never a show!  I'm not talking about Jimmy's camera.  Mort's got a camera on our side of the street.  ""Present this coupon  to redeem a 200-minute foot massage from Tina.""  - What? - Guys, I know you're working really hard.  We all are. But I think I know who took Mom's tree  and all the Christmas stuff Bosco said was stolen.  My theory? The Bleaken did it.  Whoa. Teddy did say the Bleaken steals stuff.  Well, he's not gonna steal our presents.  Why not? Is it 'cause we're poor  and our toys break almost immediately?  No. 'Cause we are gonna stop him.  The Bleaken is coming as fast as he can   Ruining Christmas like he don't give a damn   Got to find the Bleaken, we'll follow his scent   We got to stop the Bleaken from stealing our presents   He's gonna be defeated, he's about to meet his match   And maybe when we find him   We can ask for Mom's tree back   Sure, sure, sure, but mostly,  it's about running him out of town  - before he steals our Christmas presents. - Totally.  I just think maybe once we find him and scare him,  - it wouldn't hurt to ask for Mom's tree. - Uh, yeah.  ALL:  The Bleaken is gonna   Wish that he was never born   We're coming for you, man   Hold onto your horns   I just asked for experiences this year.  The Bleaken can't steal a Korean BBQ dinner for two!  I mean, isn't that a gift card?  - He can just take it, right? - Damn it!  The Bleaken is gonna   Wish that he was never born   We're comin' for you, man   Hold onto your horns!   Ah! I'm okay.  LINDA: Thanks for doing this, Mort.  We really appreciate it. And you should know  - we never thought you were a suspect. - Thanks.  Sounds like maybe you did, but let me just push past that  and bring up the video from yesterday.  All right, let me jump to the middle of the party,  - and - LINDA: Fischoeder.  BOB: Wait. I don't remember seeing Fischoeder at our party.  And now we know why.  He looked inside, saw us, and didn't come in.  That Ba-hum-bugger. Look, it's you, Mort. Are you skipping?  (laughs): I was, uh I was just trying something.  I'm just gonna fast-forward.  Wait, wait! Stop! Go back. Go back.  - Right there. Look! - BOB: Oh, my God. Edith.  She's hiding something under her coat.  We got ya! Greatest generation, my ass!  Hey Lin, what's the plan? How do we get 'em to talk?  Here's the plan. We go in, and we get my tree back.  Oh, good. So you've thought this through.  - Edith! Harold! - Hello?  Well, nobody's in here. Maybe we should go?  (quietly): Door to the back. Let's go.  Yup. Great. Let's do that.  - (Linda gasps) - Oh, my God.  Class is full. Go away!  Hi, everyone. Sorry. Keep drawing.  What do you want? -We want you to explain this!  That picture doesn't prove anything!  - That could be any old lady. - Hey!  I mean, no, you look good. I mean, uh nothing.  - I know I do. - Yes, you do!  Can you two please just give my wife her tree?  - Tree? What tree? - We didn't take your damn tree!  Oh, you didn't, huh?  What's under your coat, Miss Grabby Puss?  Well, we took your cookie platter, okay? Happy now?  - You took our what? - Cookies!  We've had life-drawing classes all week.  We-we came to your party, and we ran out of time to buy snacks.  Nudes need snacks! It's hard work! They like cookies!  It was the end of the party.  We thought you were gonna throw them out!  No one was supposed to get hurt!  Huh. Bob, look at naked Santa.  I-I saw him, Lin. You really can't miss him.  No, look at him again. I think he was at our party.  He's Art, the artist, remember?  Oh, yeah. Um, can we leave?  No. He's a suspect. We have to question him.  Well, you two should be ashamed of yourselves. Stealing our cookies.  Now we're gonna talk to your nude, and you're gonna let us.  You were at our party, I hope you had a good time   I did, I drank the eggnog   Gross, but nicely spiked   Well, someone stole my tree, I need to know your alibi   I'm clearly a man with nothing to hide   After your party, I was in a lovely mood   I came straight here, had a cookie and got nude   He got nude, he got super nude   Ask the class, I swear it wasn't me   When I came in here, I didn't have your tree   He didn't have it, he didn't have your tree   A bush maybe. Ha-ha!  - Harold! - Sorry.  Well, I believe you, I'm sorry to intrude   It's okay, I just signed up to see some boobs   It turns out, I actually love drawing.  He loves drawing, but he's still pretty creepy   Definitely creepy   I hope you find your tree.   Well, Lin, we should probably head back to the restaurant.  No! I got to keep looking, Bobby!  I need to find my ornaments. My little babies!  Okay, okay, you keep looking, but I'm gonna get back to work  where we both work or we used to.  Good! Get out! Leave! And take your cookie tray!  LINDA:  Oh, Christmas tree, oh, Christmas tree   Where is my frickin' Christmas tree?   TEDDY:  I wonder if it was that guy   LINDA:  If I don't find it, I might die   Christmas tree, oh, Christmas tree   Where can you be, my Christmas tree?   Well, that's it.  I crossed everyone off the list.  My ornaments are just out there in the cold dyin'.  - I'm sorry, Lin. - You know what?  I'm gonna go back out there  and talk to everyone on my list again.  Maybe I missed something.  Lin, we still need to wrap presents.  What? What are you talkin' about?  Presents we need to wrap them  for the kids for Christmas, remember?  Right. The kids' presents. We haven't wrapped 'em.  - We have not. - That's bad.  It's fine. I'm just wondering when we're gonna do it.  And by ""we,"" I mean mostly you, 'cause I'm horrible at it.  Yeah, you wrap like a drunk, blind bear.  That's how I live.  Eh, I may have been a little  overly focused on getting my tree back.  Well, you know what? I'm done. -Wait. Really?  Yeah. That thief may have stolen my ornaments,  but he's not gonna steal our Christmas. -(door bells jingle)  Mom, we need to talk to you. It's about your tree.  Da-da-da. Kid-Kids, your mother's actually done looking for the tree,  - and we are all very happy about that. - Yup, yup. All done.  We know who stole it!  (gasps) You do?! Who was it?!  - Oh, my God. - It was the Bleaken!  - What? - You-you kids believe in the Bleaken? - ALL: Yeah!  - So you know about him? - Yeah, but, I mean, he's not real.  You got to believe us.  This crime has Bleaken written all over it.  Thanks, kids. It's sweet that you're trying to help,  but there's no such thing as the Bleaken.  Plus, I'm fine. Don't worry about your mom. I'm fine.  Well, we are worried about you, Mother,  but we're also worried about our presents getting stolen.  Look, everyone, tomorrow is Christmas, and I think  we should all just act as normal as we normally do.  And enjoy it as much as we can  with whatever presents Santa brings  and whatever presents we bought, which are gre-great.  And not exactly what you asked for, but close.  - Kind of. You're-you're you're gonna love it. - Yay!  All right, Mom and Dad wouldn't believe us about the Bleaken,  but maybe the cops will.  GENE: A ragtag gang like us comin' in off the streets.  Of course they'll believe us.  The Bleaken is not real.  No, you got to listen. Call the SWAT team!  Call MASH! Call Columbo!  Call everybody. He is gonna ruin Christmas!  - Stop talking! - (Louise grunts)  Listen, it's just a bunch of punk kids  stealing Christmas crap around town.  Wait. Is that a map of all the places that got robbed?  Yeah, the ones I bothered putting up there.  Also, I ran out of thumb tacks, so I just stopped.  Hmm. What about that? Is that some kind of lamp?  What? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess I kind of like lamps.  - You think I have too many in here or what?  - No. No. - No. The appropriate amount of lamps.  Well, we're really sorry we bothered you.  Seems like you're on top of everything, Sergeant Bosco.  It's punk kids doing it. Ugh. Punks.  - And thank you for the water. - You're welcome.  What happened, Louise? You got out of there really fast.  Did you have to toot? 'Cause I just went for it.  They can't arrest you for that.  Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause I took this!  GENE: A picture of the side of Bosco's face?  - Not his best angle. - But great lighting. Lamp lighting.  No, it's a picture of the map.  Now that we know where the Bleaken stole everything from,  maybe we can triangulate, and find his nest.  I'll try-angulate anything once.  There's a pattern. I know there is.  Is it plaid? It's probably plaid.  Wait. Isn't this spot right in the middle? Like,  the exact middle of all of them?  I guess so. What does that mean?  It means it's got to be the Bleaken's lair.  I say tonight, after Christmas Eve dinner,  we sneak out, find his nest, save our presents,  and if we have time, we get Mom's tree back.  Oh, my God, did we just triangulate?  Gene, play it cool, but, yeah, we did.  You kids are quiet.  Do you, do you, do you like your ham?  It's very good ham, Father.  This ham is making me sleepy.  I'll definitely be sleeping in my bed all night now.  Okay. Uh, good.  TEDDY: All right, bastard, or group of bastards, out there  stealing decorations.  You think you're gonna get my Santa?  You're not gonna get my Santa.  You're gonna get a big surprise.  That's what you're gonna get. Yeah. Big surprise.  So should we put out cookies and milk for Santa?  All right.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh   -  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  - (sighs)  Hark how the bells   Sweet silver bells   All seem to say   Throw cares away   Ding dong, ding dong   That is their song   With joyful ring   All caroling   One seems to hear   Words of good cheer   From everywhere   Filling the air   Oh, how they pound   Raising the sound   O'er hill and dale   Telling their tale   Gaily they ring   While people sing songs   TEDDY: Now we just got to flip on the air compressor and  - (air whooshing) - Ah! Ooh! Ah, that feels good.  Come on, thief or thieves. Come and get me.  No one would suspect a man would spend his Christmas Eve in here.  (Gene groaning, smacking lips)  LOUISE: Tina, how we doing?  We almost there? We in the right spot?  Yeah, we just have to walk towards  that abandoned warehouse down this dark, abandoned street.  Everything's fine. Unless you think it's not,  and we should call Mom and Dad.  No. We've gone rogue.  We're not calling Mom and Dad.  Nobody panic, but I'm running out of walking cookies.  Come on, guys, we're doing this for Mom,  and Christmas, AKA our presents.  Eh, we really shouldn't have snuck out  I'm feeling sneaker-outer's remorse.  Tina, Mom and Dad wouldn't want us wandering around  this part of town alone, so we had to sneak out  because we love them so much.  (phone beeps)  (vibrating)  - (groggily): Uh, hello? - TINA: I don't know,  I think Mom and Dad would like to know  that we're down near the strange, abandoned building  on the corner of Garfield Street and Jackson Street, I think.  - I can't read it very well. - Tina? Tina, sweetie, can you hear me?  Bob, I think the kids snuck out of the house.  Wait, what? Tina's butt-dialing me  from the emergency phone I can hear 'em.  Tina! Tina, it's Mommy. Can you hear me?  - (muffled): Tina! - Louise, I really think  we should turn around and go home.  There's nothing out here except a thousand scary alleys.  Guys. Oh, my gosh, it's one of Mom's ornaments.  That's the one I made.  You're safe now. Shh, shh, it's all over.  It's okay. Get this ornament a blanket!  LOUISE: What?  - Ah! - Hell no!  This is real. This is happening.  So, should we, like, stake out the perimeter and call for some backup?  No, there's no time. It's Christmas frickin' Eve.  Look, footprints. Let's follow them.  Crap. Flashlight's dead.  Looks like we'll be doing this in the dark.  Cool, cool, cool.  (Tina gasping rhythmically)  -  The Bleaken is gonna  - (gasping continues)  Wish that he was never born   (gasping continues)  We're coming for you, man   Hold onto your horns   GENE: Protect us, Lord Santa.  LOUISE: Okay, all signs point to the Bleaken's lair  being inside this warehouse.  We just need to figure out  how to get in and get Mom's ornaments out.  But we've looked all over this place and there's no doors.  Maybe we could go home and make some muffins and come back.  Everyone likes to open the door  to a fresh basket of muffins.  That's weird there's footprints that lead that way,  but there's nothing over there.  It doesn't make any sense.  There's nothing here but a ditch.  GENE: A nasty little ditch.  LOUISE: Are you kidding me? We came all this way  and we can't get in?  Ugh! Hmm? What the  - Huh? - You guys, this is a wall.  Wow, someone painted a super realistic mural  on the side of this warehouse.  I thought only Wile E. Coyote could do that. Or Banksy.  You guys, I think I found the door.  Oh, my God, it's unlocked.  (door squeaks)  LOUISE: Looks like the only way to go is down.  (gasping heavily)  My nightmare called it wants its scary staircase back.  Okay, before we do this, let's talk weapons.  - What'd everybody bring? - Wait, what?  None. Why are we talking weapons now?  There was a much better time to do this,  back when we were near weapons.  Well, I have extras. You're welcome.  (sighs) Okay, here's what I got.  Ruler, for slapping or poking.  - Or measuring. - Pass.  - Key chain, for stabbing. - Or keys.  You could also take the key chain,  and you could force it down a throat.  Yeah, you could sneak it into someone's mouth.  Yeah.  Hey, what's that? Oh, keys in your mouth.  - Wha-What else you got? - Uh, you know, Mace, knife.  - But I'm keeping those. - Oh.  Uh, I guess I'll go ruler, but I don't feel good about this.  Shall we?    GENE: Okay  LOUISE: Weird. Why would there be stairs  that lead to a brick wall?  Maybe it's another painting?  Like, maybe it's a picture of a brick wall  painted on a super easy to walk through piece of paper.  Ow. No, that feels like brick.  BOB: All right, Tina said the corner  of Garfield and Jackson,  but those streets don't intersect.  She's not good with directions, Bob.  Nobody is in our family.  We're lucky we ever get anywhere.  We're so stupid. Oh, God, my babies!  My babies are in danger, no!  - (sobbing) - Lin, Lin, Lin.  Lin, let's try and stay calm.  This is a-a totally safe area  - for kids to walk around. - (dogs growling, snarling)  See? Those dogs are playing  - to the death. - It's all my fault.  If I hadn't gotten so caught up in my ornaments investigation,  the kids wouldn't be in danger right now.  - That's true. - Bob!  You're not supposed to agree with me  when I blame myself.  BOB: Oh, right, it's, uh,  then it's not your fault.  Thank you. Now say it's all your fault.  What? Why-why?  - Say it. - No.  Okay, it's both our faults.  (sighs): Fine.  LINDA: Well, this is Garfield and Johnson.  Could she have maybe not read it very well?  BOB: Maybe. We haven't bought her new glasses  since she was six.  Well, there are footprints here,  and they could be kid-sized,  and there's a lot of cookie crumbs.  (sobbing): Oh, God, no!  My babies are in there. No. Why?  Eh, so no decorations thief yet.  That's okay. It's a waiting game, right?  Here comes nice Mrs. Chang with her little doggy.  Hello, little doggy.  Hey, she's not picking it up.  So she's the one that doesn't scoop.  I did not suspect that. All these years.  Uh-oh, uh-oh, there's the smell.  (gagging)  That's bad. Oh, that's bad.  Oh, it's coming in the suit.  Ugh, it's trapped in here. No, no ugh!  Don't puke in Santa. Don't puke in Santa.  (Gene grunting)  LOUISE: Ugh, we've pushed on every brick  on these stupid walls and nothing works.  (door creaks)  Did you guys hear that? I think someone's coming.  (whispering): Everybody be quiet.  It's probably the Bleaken,  or maybe one of his minions.  Do you think they call themselves ""Blinions""?  If they don't, they're making a terrible mistake.  (gasps) You guys, I think I just realized  why there's a staircase leading to nowhere.  - Why? - To trap someone.  (gasps, groans)  Okay, here's the plan: we hide behind here,  and as soon as they come down,  - we jump 'em. - I love the hiding part.  Everybody get out your weapons.  Is it too late to switch?  Great ruler here if anyone wants it.  - Incredibly accurate. - Shh, here they come.  Get 'em!  (all shouting)  - BOB: Oh, my God. - Hold on. Hold on, stop, stop.  - Mom? Dad? - Kids?  Oh, my baby, baby, baby, babies.  Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.  Did-did someone just hit me in the face with a ruler?  - It was Gene. - It-it hurt.  Oh, did it? Cool.  I mean, shame on you, Gene. That's our father.  What are you kids doing down here?  Why'd you attack us?  We thought you were Blinions.  How did you know where to find us?  You butt-dialed us.  We could hear you talking in the background.  Huh, that's funny.  I wonder who it could have been.  Who's got the most scared butt?  Mom's got the most fierce butt.  Thank you, Gene.  But Dad's is the most lived-in.  Thank you, Gene.  I did it, okay, Louise?  I called Mom and Dad, and told them where we were.  - It was me. - Uh, yeah, I figured.  Oh.  Well, whatever. We're all here.  Maybe you guys can help us  get past this brick wall.  By the way, how long did it take you guys  to figure out the door was in the mural?  Way too long. I still don't think  - your mom gets it. - I get it, kind of.  It's a mirror, right?  - BOB AND LOUISE: No. - It is.  - (loud boom) -(all gasp) - Oh, my God, what was that?  - (booming continues) - You guys, look.  That step is rattling,  like it's hollow or something.  Huh, that's odd.  Dad, help me lift this up.  Easy, Bob, easy your back.  - Lift with your legs, you're so frail. - Oh, my God.  Why are we doing this?  Whoa, a secret staircase inside a staircase.  It's an architectural turducken.  Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's great.  - Uh, now let's go home. - What?  No way. We came this far. We can't turn back now.  We're so close to finding the Bleaken.  Louise, the Bleaken isn't real,  - and he didn't steal Mom's ornaments. - Okay, fine.  Then how do you explain this?  (gasps) One of my ornaments.  - What the - Where did you kids find this?  Here. That's what we're trying to tell you.  A map of the robberies led us to this area,  and then we followed a trail of black feathers and footprints  into this building.  Obviously, something is going on.  Where there's smoke, there's feathers.  Listen, kids, I'm glad you found one of the ornaments,  and I am really glad you're okay,  but there's no way we're spending Christmas Eve  in a dark, scary warehouse. Right, Lin?  - Here's the thing, Bob. - Oh, no.  Now, I'm not saying the Bleaken took my ornaments,  - 'cause it could have been anyone. - Right, sure.  - But somebody stole 'em. - Mm-hmm.  And it sure seems like the kids are right,  that whoever stole them is inside this building  - right here, the one we're standing in right now. - Mm  So, I'm staying till I find my ornaments.  - Yes! - But you can take the kids home.  - What, wait, what? - I'm not leaving you here.  - Neither am I. - I think she'll be fine.  Wait, I-I'm staying with Mom.  Me, too. Who said she'll be fine?  That sounded cowardly.  Okay, we'll try and find whoever stole the ornaments.  - The Bleaken. - Not the Bleaken.  But you all stay behind me,  and we leave in 20 minutes, no matter what.  - Tina, give me the ruler. - No.  - Tina. - Fine. Let me show you how to use it.  - (grunts) - Ow.  I can't believe we're doing this.  Such a bad idea. Such a bad idea.  Such a bad idea.  That's great, Dad, great for morale.  Keep it up.    Someone's stealing all the Christmas cheer   Do you hear what I hear?   Inflatable vinyl decorations make this time of year   Do you hear what I hear?   A Santy Claus standing on the lawn   With a hidden Christmas surprise   It's a grown man dressed in disguise.   - (Tina groans) - You still want to do this, Lin?  - Because we can turn back. - Some jerk has my tree, Bob.  Yeah, Dad, and that jerk happens to be  a ferocious, mystical beast  who's trying to ruin the holiday, just FYI.  Everyone's being really rational.  This is great. Really, really, really, really great.  TEDDY:  A jerk or two   Out there in the night   If he comes, he's gonna get a fight   If he comes, I just hope he doesn't bite.   - (Linda moans) - (lamp crackles)  - That's not good. - All right, nobody panic.  W-We'll just wait till the lights come back on.  Or until we're killed.  (lamp crackles)  (all screaming)  (Tina gasping)  LINDA: What the heck was that thing?  I-It was a it was  What do you think it was? It was the frickin' Bleaken!  Okay, we should definitely turn back.  Bob, that thing can be explained.  I don't know how, but it can.  We got to keep going. It's like IKEA.  We can't go back. We got to push forward.  Watch out for Swedish meatballs.  Oh, okay, fine, we'll go toward the thing  with feathers and the deer head.  All right, I'm gonna open this a crack,  even though every part of me tells me not to do this.  Everyone stand back.  Oh, you're standing way back.  That's good.  (dance music playing)  What is it? What do you see?  It's, uh, not what I expected.  It's not a horrible pit of death?  Hmm, I mean, it depends on how you feel about trance music.  Is this Moby's house?  Oh, it's a  (dance music playing)  -  rave. - BOB: Yup. Just a rave.  TINA: Whoever these people are,  they have a lot of creative ideas.  Like the illusion wall and the secret staircase.  LOUISE: So instead of the Bleaken's nest,  we get a bunch of people dancing like nobody's watching?  What a rip-off.  (gasps) Look!  TINA: Whoa. Mom's tree.  Everyone, we're leaving in a second.  Right after I get my frickin' treetop back.  Mom is literally raving mad.  (dance music playing)  I bet all this stuff is stolen.  Yeah. And that guy stole my dance move.  I think that's the reading reindeer  from in front of the library.  I recognize his glasses.  Stupid young people.  They think they can just take things for their fancy rave.  Don't worry, Lin, we're gonna get your tree back.  I mean, it's really high up, but  DJ ELEV-8: Hey, everyone.  DJ Elev-8 here.  That's spelled with the number eight.  And this is asinine with the number nine.  Just a few minutes left until the clock strikes midnight  and it's officially Christmas morning.  You all know what that means.  It's time to elev-8!  - Ugh. Unbelievable. - Okay, I think if we just  quietly and inconspicuously make our way over to  I'm gonna get on that microphone  and give these people a piece of my mind.  Please don't do that, Lin.  Please do that, Mom.  Bob, you go get my treetop.  Kids, you stand underneath your father in case he falls.  I got a party to poop on.  BOB: Oh, my God, that's so high up.  GENE: This is what I thought a rave looked like.  But it is not what I thought a rave smelled like.  TEDDY: Okay. I can't take the smell anymore.  I got to move away from the dog poop.  (grunts) Damn it.  Oh whoa, oh, whoa!  (shouts)  Just got to get my arms under me, like a push-up.  Just got to do one push-up.  (grunting)  What's wrong with me?  I can't do one push-up?  (straining)  (grunts)  (sighing)  Oh, God. This is really the stupidest way to die.  Don't worry, Dad. You're not gonna die.  I mean, if you fall, it would be a tough road back,  but you're not gonna die.  Yeah, I bet Santa falls off roofs all the time,  and he's only in slightly better shape than you.  Just for the record, your butt crack's not totally out.  I know it, I feel it.  I feel the breeze.  - (microphone feedback) - Hello! Hello, people!  Uh, can I have your attention please?  Hey. What the ? Get off of that.  Get off get off it Give it to me!  What are you doing? I'm killing that mic.  Where's that damn switch?  I know you're all having a fun time  in your little rave cave, but I need to say something.  Normally, I would love to be doing a rave with you,  but this is bull crap.  This is not what Christmas is about.  It's not about stealing things, and secret tunnels.  RAVER: We don't have a permit for this.  That's why we have all those things.  To keep people out Who brought her?  And no one stole anything!  Oh, go play ping pong with your ding dong.  You know full well what you did, you Christmas burglars.  Look, you took my treetop.  Uh, hi.  So we're taking it back.  And my ornaments.  But you know what I can't get back?  My Christmas spirit!    Huh, what's happening?  Wha what is that?  (crowd gasping)  Whoa.  Hello. (laughs)  Most of the year, you know me as Cleavage To Beaver.  But it's Christmas, so tonight, I'm Miss Triple X-Mas.  - (whistling) - Welcome to our party. I'm not sure what  this grumpy lady is yelling about, but it's midnight.  So I'm gonna sing my Christmas song.  Twinkly lights   Shine   If one of them goes out, then none of them   Light   Whoa.  Or at least that's how   It used to be   Now the LEDâs work a little bit differently   But you know what I mean   (crowd cheers)  Twinkly lights, twinkly lights   That's what makes Christmas bright   All different colors, and all different types   I mean, sure there are a lot of white lights   But you need an assortment of lights   To do it right   Finally, a song about light-bulbs.  Marbles? Marshmallow? Dalton?  And when they want to tell us that we're all wrong   I'm here to tell you that we're   All   Lights   - Oh, my God. -  You twinkle   -  You twinkle for me  - Hi. Excuse me.  Hi. You're  uh, you're not the Bleaken, are you?  No. I'm-I'm a person. In a costume.  Well, just so you know, we could've taken him.  - Right, guys? - Yeah!  We would've sent him back to Bleakentown.  I had a ruler. I really don't know how it would've gone down.  (crowd cheering)  - Oh, not again. - Wait, wait, wait!  Don't turn me off. I want to apologize.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I yelled at you.  I didn't realize how w-wonderful this party was.  I-I I couldn't see you.  I thought you were dumb kids.  MARSHMALLOW: I'm 23.  I thought Christmas gave up on me,  but but maybe I gave up on Christmas.  RAVER: Can you tell us all this later?  Wait, wait, listen! I, uh, I have to confess something.  Uh, something I did that I feel really, really bad about  and now I wish I could undo.  I called the cops and told them the Christmas thieves are here  and they're on their way. I'm sorry.  - (crowd groans) - Oh, no.  You called the cops?  They're gonna shut us down.  I know! I'm so sorry.  I'm really, really sorry.  - Hi, Marshmallow. - Mm-mm.  I'm sorry I called the cops. I feel terrible.  It was dark, and I couldn't see all your beautiful faces.  You called the cops and ruined our Christmas party.  -This party is all I have. -Okay, I'll be honest,  I have a couple different things going on tonight,  so I was gonna leave, like, a little early,  but this is still not cool, Linda.  Okay, I admit it. I ruined your party.  I just got so mad.  I-I freaked out 'cause you stole my ornaments.  For the last time, lady, we didn't steal your ornaments.  Well, someone did!  I did.  (gasps) Art, the naked artist guy?  I confess. I stole your tree, and these lights,  and I did it by myself.  Don't blame anyone else here, it was all me.  And to think I gave you drugs.  But why?  I was put in charge of decorations.  I didn't have any money.  And I didn't think it was hurting anyone  if I borrowed a few things here and there.  I borrowed them, kind of.  And then I put all this up.  Oh, it is beautiful.  - Oh, I know. - So how'd you boost our spruce?  I hid it in the Dumpster in your alley when I left your party.  (gasps) You threw my tree in a Dumpster?  I placed it, I placed it in the dumpster, very carefully.  Right next to some old meat.  And then, after I finished my nuding, I came back for it.  It's just, this party's usually at The Wiggle Room,  and it always looks amazing.  And I know it's important to a lot of people,  and I just  I had a dream of making it look beautiful in here,  to bring people a little bit of light.  (gasps) I had the exact same dream.  That's why I threw my Christmas party.  LOUISE: This one was way better though.  They were both good. Who's to say?  - I mean - Well, I  They're here! The cops are outside!  Well, I guess that's that. Party's over.  Oh, my God, I am so late for this next thing.  I would honestly bring you all,  but I don't even have a plus-one,  so I doubt it would be cool to show up with, like, 500 people.  Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.  This party's not over.  Bob, what do you mean?  Look, we called the cops.  I mean, you called the cops, I never would've done that.  The least we can do is save the party. I have a plan.  I just need that costume.  GENE: Dad's about to get horny!  Where's the god-dang door?  - BOB: Hey! (whoops) - What the?  Over here! I'm the Christmas thief!  The Bleaken is real.  Come and get me!  (panting)  Ooh, hit him with the car. This will be fun.  - Do it. - (siren wailing)  It worked. They're chasing him.  The cops left. Party back on!  (crowd cheering)  (dance music playing)  LINDA: All right!  (grunting): Ah!  (panting): I'm up. Stronger than ever.  (sighs)  (siren wailing)  (panting): I think I lost them.  (laughs)  Oh, my God, the Bleaken's real.  (screams)  (both grunting)  -Bleaken? -Santa?  -Bob? -Teddy?  Oh, thank God, I thought you were  uh, what are you doing?  (panting): It's a it's a long story.  Eh, same. It all started earlier,  - when I heard from uh, Bosco, that - Uh-oh.  -They're coming. -Wait.  - Are you running from the cops? - Yeah, yeah.  Very much. I-I need to hide.  Uh, turns out, I'm bad at that.  I-I think I got the perfect place.  Hmm.  We lost him. Oh, well.  How about we get lost in some Kung Pao chicken?  TEDDY (whispering): This is a great idea.  I knew we could both fit in here.  -Well, we can kind of fit. -Yeah.  - I mean, um, it's a little snug. - Shh, shh, shh, shh.  Wait. Aren't we right in front of your house?  Couldn't we have just gone in there?  - Shh, shh, shh. - Teddy.  - Aren't we right in - Shh, shh, shh.  - Why do you keep - Shh, shh, shh.  - Teddy. Why do you keep shushing me? - What? Yeah.  I thought I heard something.  - Oh, sorry. Yeah. - Yeah. So stop doing that.  That's why I'm trying to stop you from talking.  Why? 'Cause I'm I have something to say.  - Yeah, what? Yeah, yeah. Shh. - I said  We don't need to hide here, we could go  Shh, shh, shh.  - Shh. What? - I'm leaving.  - No, don't go. - Good-bye.  - TEDDY: No, don't go. - BOB: Teddy, let go of me.  TEDDY: This is the best Christmas Eve ever.  Don't ruin it.  - (dance music playing) - Well, I guess there's no Bleaken.  I kind of wanted to fight him.  Maybe there is a Bleaken.  Maybe we scared him away with our tough,  badass, positive can-do attitude.  You might be right.  I mean, look at Mom.  I love Christmas!  I love Christmas!  - Mom, did you sleep? - She hasn't even sat down.  Uh, somebody gave me a little something at the party.  I feel amazing.  Hold on, I got to lie down for a second.  (snoring)  Isn't she an angel when she sleeps?  Well, Merry Christmas, everybody.  BOB: I'm just gonna, uh, feel her pulse.  Yeah, she's okay. She's fine.  Twinkly lights, twinkly lights   That's what makes Christmas bright   All different colors, and all different types   I mean, sure, there are a lot of white lights   But you need an assortment   Of lights   To do it right   Ooh, ooh   And when they want to tell us that we're all wrong   I'm here to tell you   That we're   All   Lights   - It's twinkle  - Bright twinkly lights   - Twinkly lights  - They twinkle for me   - Make it light  - That's right   Ooh, ooh   White light, black light   Twinkly lights, bright light   White light, black light   Twinkly lights."
"1    (Tina groaning)  Whoa, Tina, you all right there, girl?  (Tina continues sustained groaning)  Should we unplug her and plug her back in?  Does anyone know if she's still under warranty?  Not to be insensitive, but should we drag her  into a soundproof closet and just get on with our day?  Or let's at least walk ahead of her.  Or maybe we should put her ahead of us  - so people know we're coming. - Okay, coming through.  Move. Move!  LINDA: So, Teddy, you got  any big Valentine's Day plans tomorrow night?  Oh, yeah. I'm finally gonna check out that show Law & Order.  I DVR'd 400 episodes. Gonna try to catch up.  Oh! A night of romantic murder.  No, don't say anything! No spoilers.  Well, Bob and I have big, big, big plans.  We went on Kissin' Koupons,  that site that's like a Groupon site for couples.  We got each other fun experiences.  Yeah, I got us a limo ride.  Bob! It was supposed to be a surprise.  - It was? -Yes. And I'm still not telling you what I got you.  I know how to play.  - (door bell jingles) - (Tina groaning)  Some news. Tina's completely broken.  Says you. I like new Tina. You know what you're getting.  - You know, it's consistent. - Tina?  Tina, honey, what's wrong?  (continues sustained groaning)  Tina?  O-Okay, we're gonna have to figure this out later.  Kids, take your sister upstairs and do something.  - (sustained groaning continues) - Tina, talk to Mommy.  Tina, if you tell us what's going on,  - maybe we can help. - Okay.  Okay, everyone, I made some calls.  - I found out what happened. - What is it?  I guess Jimmy Jr. has been hanging out with Becky Krespe.  - Becky whosit? - Becky Krespe.  She just got her braces off, and now she's Miss Thang.  Right. And since tomorrow's Valentine's Day  - (groaning grows louder) - Ugh.  - (groaning stops) - Tina's probably worried  that Jimmy Jr. Won't be her valentine.  - Aw, honey, is that it? - (groaning): Uh uh-huh  - (groaning stops) - It's gonna be okay.  There's a lot of other fish in the sea.  And not little dumb guppies like Jimmy Jr.  Big, handsome sharks with big shark muscles. Rrr!  And crabs with abs.  Louise, go pull down your sister's covers.  Let's get this girl to bed.  It'll all look better in the morning.  - It's only 7:15! - Do it!  - (Tina resumes groaning) - O-Okay. Bob, get her up.  - Come on, help me. Come on. Get her up. - (Bob straining)  - No. - Gene, help your father, help your father.  Grab the head.  - (groaning, grunting) - Aw, it's too floppity!  I'm afraid it's gotten worse.  Worse? How is that even possible?  - (gasps) - (Tina hyperventilating)  Tina, what's going on?  Use your words, honey. Look at me.  This morning, Zeke texted Tammy who texted Jocelyn  who accidentally texted me, even though she meant to text  her cousin Tina who lives in Clearwater, Florida,  that Jimmy did ask Becky to be his valentine,  and she said yes, and they're going on a date tonight,  and it's Valentine's Day and my life is over!  Time of death: 9:15 a.m.  Time of breath: powerful!  - Sorry. - No, I love it!  (Tina groaning)  I miss Tina's bones. I didn't even know I liked them.  I never got to say good-bye.  The worst thing is, this whole time,  she's been sitting on the remote.  Tina? Tina bean-a?  It's me. It's Mommy.  - Hi, Mom. - It lives!  You remember how you were gonna babysit tonight  so Dad and I can go out for Valentine's Day?  - (hyperventilating) - Linda, don't say ""Valentine's Day.""  Uh, s-sorry, sorry. I-I meant regular February day  that means nothing, stupid February day.  Uh, I-I don't think we can go  on our amazing Kissing Koupon Valentine's Day.  - (hyperventilating) - Sorry.  - Bob, don't say ""Valentine's."" - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  - Oh, God, now I'm saying it. Now I said it. - Sorry. Sorry.  (car horn honking musically)  GENE: Yes! I finally know what I want to be when I grow up:  that limo!  LINDA: Oh my God!  - I know what we have to do! - What?  Me and Louise are gonna take Tina out in the limo  for a girls' night out to cheer her up!  - Oh, great idea. - Yeah, and you and Gene  are gonna do the thing I bought.  Oh. I Wait. Why  Well, we could just stay here.  And waste my Kissin' Koupon?  Are you crazy? It's only for tonight.  - Uh - Come on, Bob.  Tina needs this.  Tina needs a girls' night.  A real girls' night.  And we're gonna get in that limo and give it to her, right?  Yeah! Let's do that thing where I get in a limo.  - Yeah! - Okay, fine.  Gene, will you do me the honor of being my date tonight?  Yes! Just make sure you wait three days to call me afterwards  so you don't seem too desperate to be my dad.  Okay, girls, get your miniskirts on.  The li-mom-sine leaves in five!  Okay, Tina? Does that sound fun? Right?  (sighs) I guess.  Girls' night out! All right!  Hi. We're your riders for tonight.  Hi. Hello. Uh, I'm your driver. Call me Nat.  They didn't tell me I was driving  three real-life princesses for Valentine's Day.  - (Tina groaning) - Uh-oh.  Uh, Nat, ix-nay on the Valentine's Day talk, okay?  Yeah. My sister got dumped by a jerk,  and her puberty operating system is crashing.  - Uh-oh. No bueno. - Yeah, so we're taking  my little lonely heart for a fun girls' night out,  and we're not gonna talk about boyfriends or love  or Valen-you-know-what, okay?  Copy that. Loud and clear, sir.  Wow! This is nice!  Nat, let's get this baby started and take her up to about 120?  Okay, excuse me, little bunny girl? -Yeah?  You can't stand up in the sunroof  - while we're driving. - Well, what about  What about Big, the film starring Thomas Hanks?  It's called ""movie magic."" You want to know what happens  when real people drive around hanging out of a sunroof?  - Yeah. - Decapitation. It happens all the time.  There was a huge uptick in them right after that film came out,  but you didn't hear anything about it, I'm sure.  - Right? Right? - I mean, I I didn't hear anything.  Yeah, not a word. Government covered it up.  Oh, my gosh.  Thomas Hanks himself got paid a bunch of hush money.  - How much? - Around $12,000.  - That all checks out. - All right, so where to?  Sad girl, you wanna go run over this kid who dumped you or what?  - No. - That sounds like a good plan.  No, we're not running anyone over.  But you know what always makes people feel better  after they get their hearts broken?  - Lizards. - No!  Throwing a tub of baked beans at a meter maid.  No! Makeovers.  Pretty sure the right answer was lizards, Mom.  What do you think, Tina? Makeovers?  - Sure. - She loves it!  But we should probably get a bunch of baked beans just in case.  Uh, what do you think this is for, little miss?  LOUISE: Ah, I knew I'd find my real mom someday.  Okay, so your mom wrote, ""Go down to the wharf,  ""turn left at the cheese-on-a-stick booth,  look up and you'll see it.""  - Is it that bird? - Maybe.  Do you think it's that drunk clown?  I I wish.  I'd love to push him over.  - ACROBATS: Hup! Hup! - BOB: Oh. Oh, no. Oh, God.  GENE: Just to warn you, I ate the perfectly wrong things  for this activity.  Welcome, couples.  Get ready for the night of your life.  I'm Tim Flanagan, and this is my brother Jerry.  You may be asking yourselves, ""Can I really do trapeze?""  Well, look at me. I got 30, 40 extra pounds on me.  I got diabetes, major depression,  a weird skin thing on my foot, you name it.  Point is, if I can trapeze, you can trapeze.  We'll be learning tonight's routine  on the low trapeze over those mats.  And then moving to the high trapeze,  complete with costumes and music.  I know what you're thinking:  ""Will I really be ready for all that?""  Well, in 45 minutes, your answer will probably be, ""Sure.""  Questions?  - You, mustache. - Uh, hi. Yes.  I-I'm here with my son, because, well, it's a long story,  but he's only 11 Can we still do this?  It's totally okay if the answer is no.  Oh, trapeze is fun and safe for all ages.  Except children under ten They can't participate.  Yay! I'm swinging with my dad!  Damn, one year off.  Uh, excuse me,  but have you three gorgeous gals seen my clients?  It's us! Look at Tina!  Isn't she breathtaking? Aw, look at her.  I'm looking at her, and I literally cannot breathe.  And with you,  - what was the thought process? - Nightmares.  Love it. Now, I know what we ought to do.  We ought to figure out where this kid is that messed you up.  - What'd you say his name is? - Jimmy Jr.  Yeah, terrible name. I hate him because of his name.  We find out where he is, and then we go down there,  and you say, ""Hey, look at what you're missing,""  and then you throw a drink or a smoke bomb on him.  - Um - Yes!  No, no. Nat, um, I appreciate your input,  but what we need is some good old-fashioned cheer-'em-ups.  Let's crank up some girl power jams  - and limo it out of here! - You're the boss!  Whoo! Pickles!  - NAT: Hey, no sunroof! - Oh. Sorry. Comin' in.  Whee!  This is a girl power jam   We're all girls, no mans   Girl power, girl plus power makes girl power!     This is a girl power jam   We're all girls, no mans.     I'm not giving up yet, Tina.  Okay.  LINDA: All right, let's get some sugar in this booger  and cheer her up.  What do you mean you don't have anything?  It's Valentine's Day, and you don't have a reservation, ma'am.  Oh, come on. My little girl got her heart broken and she  - NAT: Linda. Linda. Linda. - Oh, uh, wha where's that ?  Come over. I got us a table.  - Nat? - Follow my voice. Can you see me?  - Hey, it's Nat! - Follow my voice!  Follow. Follow. Follow. Follow.  - Nat, how'd you do it? - I know the owner.  Saved his life After I hit him with my car.  Now, should we get the mega-misu flight or the ultra-mega?  Ah, man, Nat, you sit next to me, 'Kay?  And I mean forever.  - BOB: Oh, God. - I know, I know, it's a long way down.  But if you fall, this harness thing'll catch you, no problem.  Nobody's died on this.  Well, except for one guy, but that was 'cause  someone dropped a sword out of a hot air balloon.  Totally unrelated. We weren't liable.  - Hi, Dad! - Hi, Gene.  All right, I'm gonna let you go now, and you're gonna swing out.  - Hup, hup! - Hup, hup!  (Bob and Gene scream)  Okay, good job on the swinging.  Eh, it's all right.  Now, get those legs up! Hup, hup!  Oh, my God. So high up.  Beautiful. Now release your arms.  - Hup, hup! - Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God  Don't barf, don't barf, don't barf, don't barf  We're doing it, Dad!  - We're flying! - I hate it!  Now grab hands! Hup, hup!  - TIM: Great job! - And let go! Hup!  Hup! Hup! Hup!  - (grunts) - I can't!  Hup, please?  Gene, I think we have to let go.  - No way! You let go! But don't! - I w I won't.  Guys, please either let go and swing back  or release your legs and drop.  We have six other couples to get through tonight.  (screaming)  Uh, I-I think we're gonna need a minute!  So, my little Tina-misu, how are you doing? You feeling better?  (sighs heavily) I'm full.  - Full of sadness. - Oh.  I don't want to beat a dead horse,  but we could get a dead horse.  And we don't put it in the kid's bed he'd be expecting that  We put it in his backpack under his homework.  He reaches in, all proud he did his homework,  and bam! Dead horse.  - It's the perfect plan. Let's get the check. - All right.  Wow. You guys just said ""dead horse,""  like, five times, and Tina didn't even react.  This is bad. I don't get it, honey.  You're always on and off with Jimmy Jr.  Why is this time so hard?  It's not just that we're off right now,  or even that he has another valentine.  It's it's He  I made him a special picture frame for Valentine's Day  with a picture of us in it, but then he hung it  in his locker with a picture of Becky in it!  - He what?! - He what?!  That son of a bitch!  Well, that's it. I think it's time we do Nat's plan.  Okay, I'll call my guy.  It's Valentine's Day so he might be pretty low on dead horses,  but I'll see what he has in the raccoon family.  No, no, we're not gonna do anything with dead horses,  or anything violent, but we are gonna make sure  his date with Becky doesn't go so great.  Let's do it.  It's time for little JJ to pay pay.  Hear, hear! Now, who has ghillie suits,  and who needs ghillie suits?  All right, first things first.  We need to find out where this little Rom-ee-no is at.  - Right, right.- And once we do, and this is just a pitch  We can all pitch stuff if we want  What if we hit 'em with one of these guys?  - What is that? - A stink bomb.  I got a whole glove compartment full of 'em.  I throw 'em at white guys, pigeons,  people I've dated etcetera.  Now, Tina, did you ever put a tracking device on Jimmy?  Sew it into the back of his neck while he was unconscious, or ?  Uh, um, no.  - Tina! Ugh! - I'm sorry.  Damn it! That's okay. That's okay!  - Sorry. - And you have no idea  where he might be taking Becky tonight?  I don't know. I don't know!  Ooh, ooh, what about this Becky girl?  Could she be a spy? Maybe some sort of a Cylon?  Where would she want to eat dinner?  - Leave that to me. Nat, phone. - You got it, boss.  - Tina, dial Tammy. - (dials, line rings)  Hey, Tammy, it's Louise Belcher.  - I need Becky Krespe's number. - What for?  To do something mean.  (laughs) That's hilarious! Okay, it's 201  Hi. Has Becky left for her date yet?  She hasn't? Okay, great.  No, I don't want to talk to her. She hates me. Bye!  Okay, she hasn't left yet,  so if we book it over there, we can follow.  Tina, do you know where she lives?  712 Forest Lane, blue house with a little flamingo on the lawn.  - Wow. Stalk much? - Yes. Like, a lot.  Good girl. Let's roll.  (grunting) Oh, you know what?  I think it's maybe faster to just get out and go around.  Nope. I pushed in more and I'm stuck.  Little help here, gals?  - (all grunting) - NAT: Oh, no, no, no, no!  Okay, yeah, that helps. (yells)  My bra unhooked.  Oh, I landed on my hand grenade.  - Hand grenade? - No one freak out.  The guy who sold it to me said it was inactive. Let's see.  Yup, we're good.  BOB: Gene, we can't stay up here forever.  GENE: Maybe we could.  I could still have a very fulfilling life.  (sighs) Okay, look, on the count of three,  we both let go with our hands.  I don't think I can.  What if instead we let go with our legs?  No! Not our legs!  JERRY: Guys, you got to let go!  BOB: We know, Jerry! Just let me talk to my son!  TIM: We thought you were doing that.  What have you been doing?  BOB: We've been busy!  Gene, we have harnesses on,  so we'll fall down, but very gently.  Okay, okay, let's do it.  All right, on the count of three.  - Hundred. - Gene, you have to trust me, okay?  Look at my face. I am your dad.  I will not let anything bad happen to you.  - We are going to be fine. - Okay. I trust you, Dad.  You guys have a very beautiful relationship.  Now, hup!  Ready? One two three.  (both screaming)  - GENE: You didn't let go! - BOB: I know!  JERRY: Are you kidding me?  TIM: Come on!  BOB: I panicked! I couldn't do it!  It's the Pestos. Get down!  There he is, Little Jimmy Jerk-o.  Look at him walking around with his evil stupid legs.  Nat, follow that car.  - You got it, T. - (engine starts)  (tires screeching)  - LINDA: Aah! You're gonna hit 'em! - NAT: Sorry, sorry.  I got excited.  TINA: Ugh. They're having heart-shaped enchiladas?  It's worse than I thought.  All right, all right, I'm gonna pull around back.  We'll Goodfellas it through the kitchen,  and then boom! Date over.  You think they'll let us in the back?  Oh, yeah. One of the busboys is my sensei.  All right, this is a bad angle.  On my signal, we're gonna casually stroll over  to the ladies' room and regroup.  - Okay, what's the signal? - ""Woof meow. Woof meow.""  Of course. That makes sense.  Woof meow! Woof meow!  Thanks for coming out with me, Becky.  You look you look really great with your braces off.  Thanks, Jimmy. It's really exciting to eat caramels again.  - And I can finally understand what you're saying. - What?  Okay, we're go for phase two.  Tina, you know what you're doing?  Yup. I sneak up as close as I can get to that table  and drop these eight stink bombs.  Uh, maybe we only need, like, three stink bombs.  Better give me the other ones.  Okay, I drop these three stink bombs,  smell up the joint and slip out the back door.  Righty-tighty, Tina.  We'll be right behind you, and we'll meet you out back.  Hands in, everyone. Girl power on 16.  One, two, three, four, five, six  - Okay, okay. 16! - Let her finish, Mom!  - Let her finish! - Girl girl power. -Seven.  - Eight. - Okay. - Keep going, Nat.  - Keep going. - Nine, ten - Okay, okay. Six  - Ten. - Let her finish!  - Okay! - Keep going, Nat. -16.  ALL: Girl power!  This is the most fun I've ever had.  Okay, here goes nothing.  (sighs) I can't do it.  What? Huh? Oh.  JIMMY JR.: Tina?  - Tina Belcher? - Oh, hey, Jimmy Jr., Becky.  Am I on fire? No? Cool. (chuckles)  What brings you guys here this evening?  Tina, what are you doing here? Did you follow us?  What? No. I-I don't even know who that limo around back belongs to.  (chuckles nervously)  Anyway, how's the enchilada?  Does it taste like, um, uh a heart?  - Tina, are you okay? - Yeah, what's going on?  (sighs) Fine. You caught me. I-I followed you here.  - Oh, no. - I got to get out there and save her.  Wait, wait. I think she's got this, maybe. Let her try.  Becky, the truth is, I-I came here  to stink-bomb the restaurant and ruin your date  because I was really sad and jealous that you got  to go out with Jimmy Jr. on Valentine's Day instead of me.  And that Jimmy Jr. Put your picture  in the frame I made for him.  - Wait. What? - Yeah, it's a good-size frame.  The picture fit really well.  But the fact is I I don't want to be this person.  And, Becky, you seem really nice.  And all you did was get your braces off,  probably because your orthodontist said it was time.  - It was. - And you accepted an invitation  to this really, really nice restaurant  with this Wagstaff bad boy, which anyone would have done.  You didn't do anything to hurt me on purpose,  and I won't do anything to hurt you.  You don't deserve to have your date ruined.  Thanks, Tina. You seem nice, too.  Also, you have some guacamole on your boob.  Oh, yeah. Thanks.  - No. Other boob. - Oh. Oh, uh, okay.  No. Other boob.  Oh. What, this one?  - It's under it's underneath. - Could you give me a chip?  I'll-I'll let you guys get back to your date now.  Well, actually, Becky, um, this isn't really working out.  - What? - What?  Yeah, I-I was gonna wait  until we got our heart-shaped flaming flan,  but I think we should break up.  There just isn't anything here.  - Are you joking? - Probably not.  He does this stuff, like, a lot.  I mean, I-I will, if you insist, I will hang for the flan.  Oh.  (chuckles, sniffles)  (chuckles) Wow.  Oh, my God, did he just break up with Becky, too? That little  Valen-twerp!  Time for a stink bomb from a hot mom!  Wait, uh, wait! Give me one, woman.  Tina, woof meow! Woof meow!  - Oh, no! Becky, come with me! - (Becky gasps)  (grunts) No, this isn't gonna work.  We're the same size. Let's run.  Wait, Tina, come back.  I-I'll date you instead, uh, um, if you want.  (sniffs) Ew!  - I'll smell you in hell. - (clinking)  Uh, wait. Wait. Who who are you?  (grunting) - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!  (tires screeching)  JERRY: Guys, it's been over an hour!  TIM: I'm worried about your bodies!  (gasps) Gene, I'm sorry. I-I  Oh, I can't get my legs off this thing.  Do-do you just want me to drop you?  No! We do this together or we don't do it at all!  Okay. Just just going to go against all my instincts  and plummet to the ground while holding my child.  Bob, I'm gonna count to three,  and if you don't release your legs,  I'm gonna charge you for a second trapeze experience.  - The full price. - GENE: We'll pay double!  - BOB: Gene, no! - JERRY: One, two  - Full price, Bob! - BOB: No, no, no! No, I'm  Okay, I'm doing it! I'm doing it!  (grunts)  Why am I doing it this way?  (groaning) Aw, it hurts so much!  Dad, release your Krakens!  I'm trying, Gene!  (both screaming)  (both grunt)  That was amazing!  And they let us keep our unitards.  There's an important lesson in there  about peeing in stuff you want to keep.  I feel so alive!  Me, too. I feel like I could do anything.  - Should we just go home and watch TV? -Yes.  I love you, Dad.  I love you, too, pal.  TINA: Becky,  I'm sorry I ruined your date with Jimmy Jr.  You didn't. He did. Should've been a red flag  when he picked me up three hours late and he called me Betsy.  You know, Valentine's Day is way more fun  when you spend it with people you really love,  like your mom and your sister and your limo driver.  And a girl from your school you don't know that well.  Boys come and go, but your girls will always be there for you.  That's right. Yes, they will, sister.  I mean, you know, sometimes women are awful to other women,  but not us, and not tonight, baby! Not tonight!  - We doin' this, ladies? - Let's do it!  Okay, I want you to repeat after me,  and I'm taping it on my phone. Ready?  - I - ALL: I  Will not sue you if I get decapitated.  ALL: Will not sue you if I get decapitated.  - Let's eat some bugs! - Yeah.  (whooping, cheering)  - (tires screeching) - Suck on this, Thomas Hanks!  LINDA: Who's big now, baby? Oh, my face!  This is a girl power jam   We're all girls, no mans   Going to salons and getting glam   Dancing in a fountain and getting wet   Bothering some fish with no regrets   Eating up some treats with our mom and friends   Hoping that this night never ends   This is a girl power jam   We're all girls, no mans   Girl power on 16!   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten   -  11, 12  -  Let her finish   -  Let her finish  -  13, 14, 15, 16   Girl power!   We're all girls, no mans!"
"1  GENE: Ah, recess.  When a man can pursue his passions.  Like taking this bush from shrubba to hubba hubba.  Yup. Nothin' like a few minutes in the old yard  before they put us back in lock-up.  Or in health class. You and I have different schedules.  Hey guys. Wow, Gene, your shrub sculpture's really coming along.  Uh, Rudy, the shrub sculpture has a name.  Monkey Booby Man.  Oh, yeah, I'm starting to see it.  There's the monkey's face.  And there's the monkey's boobs.  I thought those were his boobs?  Calm down, you're both right.  Where were you last recess, Rudy? We missed ya.  Oh. I tried to play basketball.  - Nope. Negative. - (grunts)  - No, sir. - (grunts)  Anyway, you got any extra scissors?  Take these nail clippers.  Monkey Booby manicure.  Can I have everyone's attention, please? Hello.  Ugh. What does Mr. Frond want?  This is my recess.  Hello! I'm not just gonna go away if you ignore me.  - Listen up. - Thank you.  Students of Wagstaff.  It's time to face facts.  Recess is broken.  Look around at this playground. What do you see?  Two third-graders playing catch with a shoe.  Those little boys who pretend to be cats,  like that's even a game.  Why do your own thing  when you could all be doing the same thing together?  I'm here today to present an exciting opportunity  for togetherness.  Boys and girls, I give you  - Ga-Ga ball. - Ga-Ga what?  You know, this really could have been covered in an e-mail.  Ga-Ga ball. It's a game.  Wait. So it's a game?  - Yes, it's a game. - Oh.  The best thing about Ga-Ga ball  is there's no catching and no throwing.  Anyone can play, no matter how hopelessly un-athletic they are.  Um, why are you looking at me when you say that?  I wasn't looking at you,  - I was looking with you. - What?  Come, children. Follow me into the pit.  That's not a terrifying invitation.  Think of Ga-Ga ball as dodge-ball, but gentler.  In dodge-ball, you hurl the ball at your opponent.  In Ga-Ga, you just slap the ball.  Anyone can slap.  - Can I slap? - You tell me.  (grunts weakly) Oh, my God, I can slap.  Now, to get someone out in Ga-Ga ball,  you must hit them on or below the knee,  where it doesn't hurt.  What happens if I power-slam the ball  into someone's nose or butter-beans?  - That's not allowed, Zeke. - Seems weird.  The last one in the pit wins.  Maybe the best way to demonstrate is  to play a couple rounds, huh?  Who wants to join me?  - Do we have to? - Well, strictly speaking,  - you don't have to, but - Oh, great, okay, buh-bye.  (sighs)  (door bells jingle)  O Kay.  Hey, wait a minute, I know you.  Aren't you the guy that reads to the kids  down at the public library?  The Wizard of Books, right?  - Abraca-books! - (laughs)  - ""Abraca-books."" - Hi, my name is Frank.  That must be so much fun, reading to kids I'm jealous.  - So, you reading today? - Yep.  Twice a week, every week.  I'm so nice, they let me read twice a week.  (laughing) Oh  And you're heading there now?  Or maybe this is how you always dress.  I am heading there, and they don't let me change  behind the periodicals anymore.  Too bad I'm gonna miss Friday's reading.  I'm going out of town.  So that's it? Story time's canceled?  For a lot of those kids, and some adults  who can hear from the biography section,  story time is all they have.  (gasps) I could fill in for you.  Hey, there you go.  I could come up with a character  and pick out a story Oh, my mind's racing.  Okay, sure. Story time is at 2:00 on Friday.  I can tell the librarian to expect  um, uh, what's your name?  Linda. Uh, aka The Duchess of Tales.  - Hmm. - Actually, no, not that.  Um, how about  Wanda Wordmouth?  She's got a mouth full of, uh, words?  - Mm - I'll keep thinking.  Lunch is great today.  The canned corn must be in season.  Hurry up and eat so we can hit the playground.  It's shrub o'clock.  We can make up that time we lost listening to Frond.  What is it with him trying to get his Frond stink  all over the playground, anyway?  The playground's bigger than him.  The playground doesn't change for anybody.  KIDS (chanting): Ga-Ga ball!  What the hell? Everyone's playing Ga-Ga ball.  Oh, my God, you like this.  You really like this.  This can't be working.  It's a Frond idea.  He has 'em, they're bad, we ignore 'em, the end.  Yeah, remember Eye Contact Mondays?  Hey, guys, I'm hitting the Ga-Ga pit you wanna come?  Rudy, it's so funny, I thought you said  you were hitting the Ga-Ga pit.  I am. I played at recess. I almost won.  I think I might actually be kind of good at it.  - LOUISE: I can't believe it. - GENE: Forget it, sister.  Let them play with their balls. We'll play with our bushes.  - Right, right. - Yeah, we're Belchers.  We don't give in to peer pressure.  Hey, Tina, we're gonna play Ga-Ga ball.  - You wanna come? - Yes.  Uh, I-I just want to see what the fuss is about.  I'll probably hate it. See you soon. (panting)  She'll be back. If I know our Tina,  she's feeling pretty silly right about now.  TINA (shouting): I love it. I'm staying. Sorry.  - Give it a minute. - I just keep loving it more and more.  - Not looking good. - I finally feel alive.  I guess she kinda likes it.  [bong!.]  Everybody's into Ga-Ga ball.  This thing blew up, literally, overnight.  Yeah, like when mom left that bottle of beer in the freezer.  Oh, hi, guys. Grab a seat.  We're talking about Jimmy Jr.'s Ga-Ga moves.  I've got great dodging moves.  - I'm like the Artful Dodger. - Dickens!  (grunting dramatically)  Heh, look at that. Look at that air.  Zeke's not so good, though.  Oh, man, that was candid, J-Ju.  Gonna have to stew on that one for a second, heh.  You slap hard, Zeke, but your aim is really bad.  Whoa. Again, very blunt. Not holding back.  Can we talk about something besides Ga-Ga ball, please?  Sure. Um, remind me, uh,  what did we talk about before Ga-Ga ball?  Ugh, come on, Gene. We can eat our lunch  hunched over a trashcan somewhere, like Dad does.  That was gonna be my first choice anyway.  Lin, could you take that to table four?  Uh, can you do it? We're brainstorming  on my story time character.  Yup, I'll just do all the jobs in our restaurant.  Sounds good.  Ooh, ooh, I got one.  I'll dress like a librarian, and when the kids come,  I'll shake out my hair and I'll take off my glasses,  and I'll say, ""Gotcha! I'm the storyteller.""  That's a hurtful stereotype, Linda.  Not all librarians want to shake their hair out.  Yeah, you're right.  Ooh, maybe Ill get body-painted  like a shelf of books, and then stand quietly  in front of some other books.  And just when the kids don't expect it,  I'll jump out and I'll say,  ""Gotcha! Stories come to life.""  Uh, why do all your ideas involve  shouting ""gotcha"" and scaring children?  Wh-Wha 'Cause I wanna surprise them.  Kids ask, ""Rudy, how are you so good at Ga-Ga?""  I tell 'em focus, diet, conditioning.  I mean, honestly, genetics plays a part.  (inhales, gasps)  - Is that Rudy? - Yeah.  Why does he have Matthew McConaughey's body language?  Hey, Zeke, think fast.  Oh! Oh, man, you got me.  You heading to the pit?  I'll go easy on you this time.  In your dreams. (chuckles)  Hey, no shame in losing to the best, right?  - Well, some shame. - Hey, guys.  Rudy, you in there, buddy?  What? I finally found a sport I dominate in, that's all.  You guys should play. You would love it.  Ugh, I wish people would stop telling us  to play Ga-Ga ball.  Yeah, no thanks.  We have our own playground interests.  Oh, like Monkey Booby Man?  Yeah, sure, he's cool.  But you know what's really cool?  Winning. And right now,  nobody does that quite like the Rudester.  Okay, you need to shut that down.  ""Rudester"" can never be said again.  Let me put this in terms you'll appreciate, Louise.  In Ga-Ga ball, you gotta hit people below the knee, right?  If you say so.  For kids like us, that doesn't leave  much of a target.  I'm smokin' suckers twice my size,  but when they come at me, I'm a phantom.  Meh, I still don't think I'd be into it.  - Ha! - Ah. Oh, man.  Oh, my God, you're right. This is amazing!  More eight-graders. Send me more eighth-graders!  - Eat that for supper! - Geez, Tina.  Snap, crackle, pop, fool.  Yeah, I'm talking to you.  Ow. Never mind, I'm out. Disregard.  Guess it's just you and me, now,  monkey booby buddy.  What's that? You want another boob?  All you gotta do is ask.  Kids, what's your favorite story  I used to read to you?  I gotta pick a book for the library.  Well, The Giving Tree  messed me up pretty good, so not that.  Can you read them TV?  I remember liking that a lot.  Anyway, Ga-Ga ball!  Tina, top five Ga-Ga plays of the day go.  Oh, my God, where to begin.  - What's Ga-Ga ball? - (Gene grunts)  - Uh, the best game? - TINA: It's the people's sport.  Try to keep up, Dad.  So you kids are playing a sport now?  How'd that happen?  The whole school is playing.  Yeah, basically everyone but Gene.  - Gene, you should play. - You should.  - You'd love it. - I love it.  I didn't think I'd love it, but I love it.  Maybe I would love it,  but the playground used to be the one place in school  where you could do what you want,  and right now, all I want to do is  work on my special project.  No offense, but how much longer  are you gonna spend trimming that shrub?  I can't help it if I keep coming up  with amazing new ideas for him.  Like giving him a pet fern named ""Fern-Ando.""  It's not my fault I'm a genius!  All right, all right, calm down.  You know what calms me right down?  A round of Ga-Ga?  - Bingo. - Mm-hmm.  Ahh! First it's all anybody  can talk about at school,  and now it's in my home,  where I lay my sweet head?!  Wow, Gene left his food on the table.  - He must really be upset. - Yeah.  (grunting) In my home!  Ahh. Oh, no.  FROND: We have a winner.  Wayne, go go, go, go.  Get out, get out.  I'm going.  I'm just picking up  the pieces of my glasses.  Not fast enough, you're not.  Any words for your fellow competitors?  No shame in losing to the best.  I love it when he says that.  Chills. Rudy, everyone.  RUDY (shouting): I am Rudy!  I wish we had Ga-Ga when I was in school.  I wouldn't have spent every recess by myself  - talking to roly-poly bugs. - Gross.  Okay, people, I have an exciting announcement.  I have secured funding to build  three new Ga-Ga pits right here on the playground!  Students, today we break ground  on the Wagstaff Gagaplex!  What is happening?  We're turning this playground  into a Ga-Ga-palooza  that will separate the Ga-Ga winners  from the Ga-Ga wieners.  I mean, everyone's a winner.  Game of togetherness, blah, blah, blah.  These beautiful pits will stretch  from where I'm standing all the way to the opposite fence.  All the way to the (gasps)  - No! - (chainsaw revving)  Monkey Booby Man!  I stepped on a fern with a little leash on it.  - What's up with that? - Fern-Ando. Give it!  Look what they did to you, Monkey Booby Man.  FROND: I have another announcement.  To celebrate the success of my groundbreaking  Ga-Ga ball program,  we are having a ball-slapping,  anything-can-happen,  winner-take-all tournament. (whoops)  What is wrong with you people?!  It's all happening this Friday at recess.  Sign-up sheets are here by the swing  - You're a bunch of Ga-Ga bots! - By the swing set.  How do you live with yourselves?!  - Okay could someone take care of this? - Monsters!  Security? I guess that means you, Ms. Labonz?  Gene, hush! Don't make me get up.  I'm very comfortable.  Fine! -Now back to your regularly scheduled Ga-Ga!  - (cheering) - Gene, we saw.  I can't believe they chopped down Monkey  - Hey, Tina, Louise, you playing? - Got to go.  - Love you, Gene! Sorry for your loss! - (whooping)  Bye, Monkey Booby Man.  It was an honor to pick your dingle-berries.  What's up, Gene? Who put a kink in your Slinky?  I'm the only person in the school  who doesn't care about Ga-Ga ball.  Yeah, I-I suppose you are.  'Cause I love it. I don't mind losin' all the time.  I think it's cool.  Hope I don't miss my turn 'cause I'm sitting here  with you behind this trash can.  - Somebody? Little help? - Could you get that, Gene?  I told Jimmy Junior I was gonna go fart in the yearbook room.  Aah! This is for what you did to Monkey Booby Man! (grunts)  - Wow. - Whoa! You mauled that ball, girl!  - (groaning) - I'm just saying, you got power,  but you got accuracy, too. If I had what you have,  I might not lie in bed every night dreadin' recess.  - And climate change, vampires - JIMMY JR.: Zeke?  Oh, no, he saw me. Aah! Get down! Get down!  I thought you were farting in the yearbook room.  - I was! - Then you came back?  Yeah! -Sweet! So are you playing or not?  Yeah! I farted, and I'm ready to go.  LINDA: Okay! Who's ready to meet your new favorite story reader?  - I'm so nervous. - Ta-da! Say hello to Punky Bookster.  When she's not rockin', she's readin'.  And the only drug she's addicted to is books.  - Wow. - Uh, is that my shirt?  Maybe. Okay, give me your thoughts, everybody. Throw 'em at me.  - That's my shirt. - Besides that, besides that.  I love it. That's my one note.  I like three of the four levels it works on.  Great. Story time's tomorrow. Teddy, you're on tech.  Music cues, lighting cues.  - There are music and lighting cues? - Yeah.  Okay, how long's it take you to learn to play guitar?  Like 20 minutes? -That sounds like more than enough time.  - So this is Ga-Ga ball, huh? - Yep.  - It's pretty great. - (panting): Yeah.  Very active.  Ooh! Watch the lamp.  - You watch your shins. - Get out of the pit, woman.  All right. Bye.  I think I'm really good at this.  You're out, sucker.  Oh. Still glad I played.  - So glad. - You're still doing this?  I never thought I'd say this, but isn't it bedtime?  We don't go to bed anymore. We do this now.  All I know is Rudy's got to go down  in that tournament tomorrow.  I am sick of him saying  ""No shame in losing to the best.""  Yeah, I think people will be pretty happy  with my winning phrase  ""You just got banged.""  Then I point to my bangs.  Mm, Tina, don't say ""banged.""  What's wrong with ""banged?""  I banged you, I banged Mom.  I'm gonna bang everyone in school.  - Tina, Tina, Tina. No-no. No. - Mm-mm, mm-mm.  What? -Wait, the winner always says something to the crowd?  - Yeah, pretty much. - And people have to listen?  People want to listen to the winners.  These days Ga-Ga talks and ca-ca walks.  And then I bang you. (grunts)  - Banged. - Oh, my God.  FROND: Welcome, everyone,  to the first annual Wagstaff Ga-Ga Ball Friendship Tournament  of Annihilation!  Ms. Labonz, I want to sign up for the tournament.  You sounded pretty intense when you said that.  I am.  Your fly is down.  Excuse me.  - (zips) - Did you see anything?  Gene, you entered the tournament?  You've never even played Ga-Ga ball before.  Yeah, well, Whoopi Goldberg wasn't a nun  until she had to go into witness protection,  and she turned that choir around.  What a wonderful opening ceremony.  Thank you, Mr. Branca.  Great ribbon dancing.  Now, contestants to your pits!  I've had quite a few energy drinks,  and we are about to light the candle on this mama jama!  (whoops)  Okay, we got the amp, the guitar, the boombox,  the strobe light, wallet chain, switchblade  Thought that would be cool We forget anything?  Um, the book, maybe?  Eh, they'll have one at the library.  - Sure. - Get ready, little kids.  Punky Bookster's gonna stage dive  right into your hearts and your face.  I am so sorry I'm gonna miss this.  Okay, here's how this works:  four preliminary rounds.  Top two from each round advance to the finals,  and the losers get bounced!  Now, let the Ga-Ga begin-gin!  (cheering)  You can do this, Gene.  (grunting, shouting)  Good start.  Ga-Ga   Ooh, Ga-Ga   Ga-Ga   Ga, Ga   Ga-Ga.   Wagstaff, I give you your final eight!  Some headscratchers in there.  Faculty, sorry about your brackets.  I know we're friends, Gene.  But in the pit, it don't mean crud.  Ugh! I thought I was gonna cuss.  I really thought I was.  TEDDY: Huh.  Looking around, I'm thinking the pyrotechnics  might not be such a good idea.  Yeah, scratch the fireworks.  Frank? What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town.  I canceled my trip. I was going to Seattle,  but apparently, they discontinued the Frasier tour.  Aw, poor Frasier.  I'm sorry, who are you?  - Wha ? - Seriously, Frank? Seriously?  Oh. You're that random lady who I said could fill in for me.  Yeah! I'm the random lady.  Well, good news I've got this.  - You can go. - Oh.  Uh, but I want to do it. It's no trouble.  - Uh, what are you, anyway? - I'm Punky Bookster.  The headbanging queen of story time.  Hmm. At least you didn't put too much work into it, right?  Now if you'll excuse me, the Wizard's got to whiz.  You'll be not here, when I get back?  Wow. What a jerk.  - You know what I think? - What?  I think he knows your character's better.  (gasps) So what do we do?  Well, Punky Bookster wouldn't leave.  Punky Bookster would stay and fight.  Damn right, she would.  (gasps) I'm thinking a read-off.  Yes. Oh, my God, yes.  I'm using my punk rock to take on the man.  Like The Wiggles.  And then, there were two.  Rudy and Gene, mano a mano, Ga-Ga a Ga-Ga.  Go, Gene, you stout little son of a bitch!  Knock him into sixth period!  Hope you had fun, Gene.  But now it's time to hit the showers.  This school doesn't have showers.  What have I been using? (shouts)  What the ? I thought the Wizard made you two disappear.  I'm here to read to some kids.  You and me are having a read-off.  We'll see who the kids like better.  Okay. Bring it on.  Standard rules. One book, two readers.  Punky reads a page, then the Wizard reads a page.  Oh, Frank, you're here.  So we have two volunteer readers today?  Don't worry, Miss Librarian.  We worked it all out.  - Pick a book. - Okay. This one?  - ""The Dinosaur Went To The Store."" - Know it by heart.  Whatever. Let's go.  - Hi, kids, I'm Punky Bookster! - (amplifier distortion)  - (children shouting) - No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, that's not a scary sound.  - It's a fun sound. - (laughs)  Hey Gene, you been to Bali?  No, why do you ask?  (grunts) 'Cause you look Ball-inknees.  Hold on, I have to think about that.  ""And then the dinosaur said,  We better go down to the store.""  Oof. He's good.  Ga-Ga black sheep have you any wool?  Yes, sir, yes, sir, I forget the rest.  Did you say something?  - No. - Oh.  ""And the dinosaur said, 'I should buy some eggs.  I don't want to go egg-stinct.'""  The end. Thank you, library!  - (applause) - Ah! Ha, ha.  Huh. I got to hand it to you, that was a good read.  That's not an easy book.  Thanks. You were pretty good, too.  You know, maybe this read-off was kind of silly.  (sighs) You may be right.  Story time shouldn't be about Punky Bookster  or the Wizard of Books.  It's-it's about the kids.  Yeah, some of them.  - Not that one. - Oh, no. That one's a disaster.  Okay, I guess the switchblade alarmed some parents.  I just wanted to let you know the police are on their way.  I didn't call them.  I thought you did a really good job,  even with the big words.  Crap. Teddy, let's get out of here.  Leave the amp, leave the guitar, let's go.  You sure? That's Mort's stuff.  I'm sure. Let's go, let's go!  Abraca-bye.  Yes. What an epic battle.  Okay. Guess it's time to get fancy.  Oh oh, crap!  (slow-motion growl)  (cheering)  A stunning upset!  Gene Belcher, the big winner.  What do you have to say?  (panting): I want to say  you people have taken this too far!  Oh, this again. Give me give me the megaphone.  - Give me - No, I earned this!  Yes, Ga-Ga ball is fun.  It's a good game.  But I bet some people here are only playing  because they felt pressured to.  Pressured by their friends.  Pressured by you, Mr. Frond.  Don't be ridiculous.  Everybody wants to be here  more than at any school activity we've ever had.  Why do you hate Ga-Ga ball, Gene?  I don't. I just don't like it  when anything-ball is all anyone talks about.  I think when people say ""everyone"" loves something,  they're being a little loose with the word ""everyone.""  Everyone loves food and air.  And Matt Damon.  But that's about it, probably.  It's not a good feeling when someone says ""everyone,""  but they don't mean you. I  I guess that's all I wanted to say.  Matt Damon!  More about Matt Damon!  Well, congratulations, Gene.  You got through to literally none of us.  Eh, fine.  ZEKE: Hold on there, Gene.  You didn't not get through to none of us.  (sighs) You got through to not none of us.  I'm glad you said what you said.  I miss melting crayons on the slide.  I miss playing cats with my friends.  Meow?  And what about you, Mr. Frond?  What? What about me?  What about that little boy you told us about?  The one whose used to talk to roly polies at recess?  Ha, well, this the roly polies were  they-they were just  Look, everybody, it's the roly poly pope.  His holy roly poliness.  BOY: Come on. We're playing football.  But I don't want to play.  We're playing football. Stop playing with your bugs!  (Frond moans)  FROND: They're crustaceans, technically.  Oh, my God. Now I'm the super cool football guy  on the playground.  Maybe we could make do with just one Ga-Ga pit.  Everybody, do whatever weird things you want.  Mr. Branca, tear down those walls.  (groans)  Sorry we got carried away, Gene.  Yeah, sorry, Gene.  I'm sorry, too.  Hey. You want to play Ga-Ga?  - Seriously? - Yeah. But first,  when you look at that hedge over there, what do you see?  Um, a hedge.  No, wait! A hippo ?  With a man bun?  Ah. Yeah, I see it.  I'm gonna say I see it?  I got a date with you later, Mr. Hippo Man Bun Shrub!  Okay, let's do this.  ALL (chanting): Ga-Ga ball!    GENE: Monkey Booby Man!  TINA: You just got banged.  - FROND: Let the Ga-Ga begin-gin! - (cheering)"
"1  So, Grandma's birthday is coming up.  Boom. Another one on the scorecard for Gram Gram.  She's still alive and probably shouldn't drive.  But you know those handmade gifts  you make for your grandma every year?  Know 'em? I half-ass 'em.  Yes, and she notices.  I didn't half-ass it. I made Grandma  a pretty great necklace last year.  One noodle on a string does not a necklace make.  Listen, Grandma could die this year.  I mean, we don't know.  - Bob. - I'm not saying she's going to.  - Yeah, it's exactly what you said. - LINDA: God forbid.  If she did die, it would be horrible.  O-Obviously. And you kids wouldn't want  the last thing she saw to be your crappy gifts.  Point is, no half-assing it this year.  Wait, did she like what I got her last year?  - What was it again? - A shell.  - A shell? - Yeah, a shell, uh, and  You know what, never mind. I can beat it.  And my dad's birthday's coming up, too, you know.  Handmade gifts for multiple grandparents.  Huh, wow. I guess we'll just take a sabbatical  from the slop shop to get all that done.  Just make the gifts. It's part of being a kid.  The worst part of being a kid.  Besides being scared the drain in the bathtub  will eat your penis.  (frightened groan)  Aw, poor Genie's weenie.  It's forced labor.  It's like when they make elephants paint.  Ugh, I wish I could paint like those elephants.  Check out this burnt Tater Tot, J-Ju.  - Wow. - I like it cooked,  not cooked in a kiln.  (chuckles) I mean, come on.  - What's a kiln? - What's a kiln?  You never been to Color Me Mine?  That's where I colored you yours.  Wait, the kiln, of course.  The Legend of the Lost Ceramics Room.  The Legend of the Lost Ceramics Room?  I'm not familiar with that one.  - Really? - Seriously?  How do you not know about that?  Everyone knows about that.  I Well, I don't, okay?  Do you not talk to people on the playground, or  - Can you just tell me, please? - Okay.  According to the legend that Wagstaff kids  have told each other for decades  - Every kid but you, apparently. - Yeah, I get it.  It all happened forever ago,  in, like, the '80s.  Back when Huey and Carl Lewis ruled the world.  LOUISE: Wagstaff had a ceramics class then.  Kids were making stuff with clay all day, every day.  But then, over one weekend,  there was a kiln fire.  Sprinklers put it out,  but it was a huge smoky mess.  GENE: Like Winston Churchill.  LOUISE: On Monday, there was supposed to be  some big school board inspection or something,  - so instead of cleaning the place up, -   what does the principal do? He panics.  He and the janitor and the janitor's brother  slap a wall where the door used to be.  - GENE: Wall slap. - LOUISE: One day,  the ceramics room is there,  the next day, it's not.  All the pinch pots, all the vases,  all the cool Papa Smurf sculptures sealed inside.  - You think that really happened? - What if it did?  What if we could find it? We wouldn't have to make any gifts,  because some kids in the '80s already made 'em for us.  - I don't know. - All we got to do  is figure out where this lost room is,  knock a hole in the wall We're in, we're out.  Bing, bang, boom.  Seems like a lot of work to avoid making some gifts.  Plus, how do you even look for a lost ceramics room?  Ugh, I think we're gonna have to talk to grown-ups.  More like groan-ups.  An art program at Wagstaff? That's hilarious.  - It rings a bell. - (school bell rings)  That was unrelated.  That legend's not true.  And I was a student at Wagstaff around that time,  so I would know. A pretty cool student, too.  Ever hear of the seventh grade class secretary?  'Cause I was elected that.  Hidden room? The only thing hidden  in this school is my personal toilet paper.  Ah, I've said too much!  - (entry bells jingle) - Hey.  Uh, you wouldn't mind if I worked on a little side project  while I'm eating, would you?  - Yeah, sure, it's okay, yeah. - Uh, maybe not.  Great. Uh, plug this guy in for me, will you?  The only outlet is by the coffee maker.  - It's kind of inconvenient. - Perfect. Plug her in.  - Mm-hmm. - I got it.  What's your side business, Teddy?  Oh, I'm replacing cracked cell phone screens.  Been doing it a couple of months now.  It's fun, but it's kind of lonely  at my house, alone.  I bet. -Uh-huh. You're really spreading out there.  Oh, yeah, you gotta, when you're working with this many  bits and pieces, you know, you got to spread it out.  I mean, but it's, like, three seats, Teddy,  - plus the light. - It's fine, it's fine.  Mm-hmm.  Oops, ah.  I dropped a little screw behind the counter.  You mind grabbing that for me, Bobby?  You want to borrow my visor?  - Not really. - You see it?  No, I just see floor right now.  Yeah, you should really use my visor.  I-I don't want to, Teddy.  - Ooh, is that it? - No, that's dirt.  - Is that it? - No, that's  - Oh, my God, what is that? - Oh. Oh, gross.  (groans) Okay, I think I got it. Here you go.  Thanks. Heh-heh. Whoa, I dropped it again.  - Bob, you mind? - Mm-hmm.  - It's a screw. It's little. - Mm-hmm.  I know, I just got it.  Is it true? I don't know.  If it's a weird, creepy legend, then it's probably true.  You should go look for it.  What else are you doing with your time?  - But how? - You need to find someone  that took ceramics then.  How do we do that?  Well, how the hell would I know?!  Whoa, whoa, can I see your coffee mug for a second?  It's not coffee, but I guess a sip wouldn't kill you.  Who's Rose Reynolds?  Beats me. It's a mug from the faculty lounge.  You think I buy my own mugs?  It looks like old Rose Reynolds made this mug in '83.  She might remember something.  - 1983, though, right? - Yes, Tina.  Cool, cool. I thought maybe 1883,  but that's ridiculous. Too long ago.  Yes, that's pretty much how I remember it.  There was a ceramics room on Friday,  then on Monday, it was gone Just walled up.  Now, Rose, at the time,  had Taco Tuesday been invented yet?  I want to say it had.  Thank you. No further questions.  Wow. Okay, so they sealed all the ceramics  and pottery in the room?  Yeah. I know for sure I made a couple Monchhichi mugs  I never got back.  So it's true. The legend's all true.  Now, can you remember where the room was?  Hmm, I think it was on the second floor  No, the first. The third. Maybe.  So first, second, or third floor. Got it.  I might have an old yearbook, if that'll help.  I think we're done here.  Geez, we were leaving anyway.  - No, I mean we are done here. - (all cry out)  - Hi. - Thank you, sweetie.  You were so still in there.  That's where kids come from?  No, that's where kids end up, if they're my kids.  We make piÃ±atas of ourselves.  It's fun. Do your parents not do this to you?  - Um, no. - Uh, can we get that yearbook?  I feel like we were lucky to get out of there  without getting kid-yata'd.  Hey, look, Frond was seventh grade secretary.  - GENE: More like sexy-tary. - Hold on, these kids are walking  - out of this room carrying pottery. - TINA: Okay.  If we can figure out where this was,  we'll find the lost ceramics room.  - And maybe ourselves. - Guys,  Rose didn't just give us an old yearbook  with so many pictures of skinny ties.  She gave us a treasure map.  Maybe this is the hallway.  Mm, not so sure.  That picture's in black and white,  and our school is in color.  Even if we find the ceramics room and it's full of ceramics,  wouldn't we be giving our grandparents  handmade gifts that we didn't hand-make?  Tina, Tina, Tina, do you love Grandma and Grandpa or not?  - Yeah. - I love them,  but I'm not in love with them.  Hmm, this doesn't line up.  Let's try the hallways upstairs.  LOUISE: Oh, there's a stairwell there. Nope.  TINA: Hmm, not a match, right?  Call the whole thing off? Good idea. I agree.  Wait a minute. This lines up.  There used to be a door where those lockers are.  They must have put in lockers over the wall at some point.  (laughs) We found it.  Okay, we can't cut through those lockers,  but we can cut through there.  That's where we dig.  Where's where you dig? What are you digging?  We're digging school in general, Mr. Frond.  We're digging all of it.  The whole vibe. And you you're great.  - Big fan. - All right, then.  Well, better get back to guidancing, you.  The world needs that stuff more than ever.  It really does.  - It really does, Mr. Frond. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.  - My goodness. - Phew, that was a close one.  Was it just me, or did he hardly have any cat hair  on his sweater today?  Oh, it's all on his back.  We're so close, guys.  At lunch, no one will be in that classroom.  That's when we crack through the wall,  into the ceramics room.  Eh, lunchtime is no good for me; I eat lunch then.  - Gene. - Okay, okay. I'll make it work.  - TEDDY: Psst. Bobby. - Yeah.  - Bob. - I'm right here. I can see you.  Look at all these customers, huh?  For me and for you.  - Right? Huh? - Uh, yeah.  I mean, it's two customers, but it's-it's good for business.  Well, I'm gonna get back to cooking.  - Yeah. I'm gonna get back to my business, too. - Okay.  - Right? - Great.  You're working, I'm working, right?  Yeah, in the same place.  We could probably split a business card.  You got to order, like, 300 of 'em  I got to get back to work, Teddy. - at a time. Okay.  - So do you. - Oh, I'll see you around.  Just saying, the cafeteria  is wildly unprepared for a to-go order.  - It's embarrassing. - Okay, that's the spot.  Here, chisel away.  A stapler and a pen?  - Short notice, okay? - Why do I have to do it?  You're the strongest; you've got puberty strength.  Guys, there's no way this is even going to work.  - It's working. - Oh, my God, these walls are crap.  Okay. I think we have a peephole.  Peephole, peephole, please!  All right. Let's see some treasure.  No, no, no, no. A broom closet?!  Hold on.  (footsteps retreating, door opening)  How's your day going?  It's okay. It's a lot of this.  Boy, do you guys look stupid for digging through that wall.  - Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burg - Welcome to Teddy's iScreen,  You Screen, We All Screen for iScreen Repair.  - Teddy, what are you doing? - What? We don't know  if the guy is here for your business or mine.  - I'm here for a quick burger. - Got it.  And how's your cell phone screen? Is it cracked?  - D-Does it have only - Uh, uh, take a seat anywhere. Sorry.  - (quietly): Teddy, please. - Right, right, sorry.  I'm gonna go ahead and get back to work, Bobby.  - Um, wh-wh-what is that? - (jazz music plays)  It's a little background music.  Helps me focus when I'm working on the detailed stuff.  - I-Is it okay? - Uh, n-n uh, no.  Of course it's okay.  It's fine. It's-it's jazzy.  Yeah, I-it's jazz. Jazzy jazz.  It doesn't even have any words.  - All right, fine. - I appreciate it, Bob.  Now I can get back in the zone.  (scatting)  - Teddy. - (continues scatting)  Teddy. Teddy.  - Teddy. - What? What?  - What? - It doesn't have no words if you're singing words.  - I was singing? - Yes, you were.  - Oh. - It was nice. - (Bob groans)  Sorry about that. I d I didn't realize I was doing that.  (scatting)  Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry.  That was me again. (chuckles, sighs)  (scatting)  Oh, my God.  - (school bell ringing) - So I guess the legend is just  a stupid legend after all.  And we're gonna have to make gifts with our own hands  like a bunch of not-lazy children.  I like these old yearbook pictures.  Everyone's hair had so much body.  And everyone's bodies had so much hair.  That's weird. If you look really close  at the picture of the ceramics room,  the exit sign in the background is backwards.  Cool. I like it when an exit sign isn't too obvious.  Let me see that.  Holy crap.  The exit sign isn't backwards, the picture is flopped.  The kid wasn't leaving from there with pottery.  He was leaving from there.  Whoa. That changes things.  So we'd need to go through either  - the science room - TINA: Which has clubs every lunch.  - LOUISE:  or math. - Which has tutoring every lunch.  - It's full of toots. - Or  we dig through the lockers.  You want to dig through steel lockers?  Destroy school property?  Definitely don't do that.  (whispering): Do that. Do that.  GENE: Good afternoon, Theodore.  Mr. B, Mrs. B.  Hey, how are your gifts for your grandparents going?  Great. We are plugging away.  Yeah? You've been working on 'em?  'Cause I don't remember seeing you working on them.  - Oh, yeah. - Oh, a lot. - Too much, maybe.  Speaking of which, uh, Teddy,  we have a quick handyman question for you.  - Got a sec? - Shoot.  How would one go about cutting through a steel locker  and the drywall behind it?  What do you need to do all that for?  We dropped a penny back there.  Sure, I could loan you some stuff.  TEDDY: Well, first thing I'd do is drill  three or four holes about a 16th of an inch apart  - with this guy here. - (grunts)  - Hold onto that. - He's heavy.  You're perforating the metal with that.  And then I would use a screwdriver to pry open a larger hole.  Wh-Why don't I hold that one? And he  - and we'll give this one to Tina. - Then, Gene,  you hold the, Ba-Ba-da-da.. Tin snips.  - Tin snips. - Like cutting paper,  but about a million times harder.  Peel back the metal, then use this keyhole saw  to get through the drywall,  and before you know it, you've got your penny back.  - Good luck, kids. - Teddy,  you're the dangerous uncle we've always wanted.  We appreciate you temporarily  switching lockers, Pocket-Sized Rudy.  Sure thing, guys.  It's a top locker, s um,  so it might be a tough reach.  - Um - You'll do great, kid.  All right.  It's gonna get real loud real quick in here.  - Tell Gene to start. - Yep. All right, Gene, hit it.  Okey doke. Welcome to the gong show.  Anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes of me hitting this gong.  I wish I would've brought my gong so we could jam.  The one day I don't bring it.  Second verse, same as the first.  One hole down. Lots to go.  Also, power tools are the best things in the world.  We could have already made so many gifts, just saying.  Can't hear you!  Oh, a-are you in there, Lin?  TEDDY: No, it's me. Teddy.  Teddy? Thi-This is the employee bathroom.  - Yeah, I know. - You're-you're not an employee.  TEDDY: Right. I was gonna use the customer bathroom,  but then I thought, eh,  I got to keep that open for our customers.  Uh-huh. But now I can't use my own bathroom.  Yeah, right. (chuckles) Well, here we are.  - Yep. - I'll be quick.  - Don't worry about it, Bobby. - That'd be great.  (Teddy scatting)  - (toilet flushes) - Oh, my God.  - Hey, Bobby? - Yeah?  Is there a plunger in here I'm not seeing?  - Teddy, I don't like that question. - Uh  Okay, what are you doing in there, Teddy?  - I'm finishing up, I'm finishing up. - Uh  - Okay, just get out now. - There's water everywhere!  Oh, God, there's water everywhere.  Unlock the door, Teddy!  Ah, it's locked! How do you open this thing, Bobby?  I'm gonna break it down!  - No, don't break the door, Teddy! - I'm gonna  - I got water all over my shoes! - Just unlock it, and I'll open it!  I'm getting water all over my  (Tina straining)  LOUISE: How's it going in there, T?  This metal knows we are wrong to seek the treasure.  - Okay, cramping up. Switch. - All right, I'll take a shift.  Hey, this isn't so tough Yes, it is!  - I'm cramping up already. Switch. - (sighs) Give me those.  (grunting) Ha-ha!  I did one snip.  Of so many snips.  Admit it, Louise, making a pot holder  sounds pretty good right now, doesn't it?  No.  This is worth it.  This is totally easy.  Come on, tiny muscles.  Okay, switch.  - Oh, boy. - What happened, Teddy?  That, uh, screw flew out like a shot.  It could be anywhere.  Oh, God. Sir, don't swallow.  - Spit that out, please. - Huh?  You might be chewing on a screw.  Uh, y-you're probably not chewing on a screw,  but-but, yeah, go ahead and spit it out, hon.  - Uh-huh. -Okay, this magnet says there's nothing in this bite.  I'm just gonna run it over your plate real quick.  - Just real quick. You just enjoy your meal. -Uh, um  Not touching your food, not touching your food.  Okay, it made a little contact right there,  but I'm not gonna do it again, just a little bit.  - Let me check the fries. - She's checking the fries.  - Checking the fries. - Wha-What's happening now?  - I hate - It's all under control, Bob.  I was just looking for a missing screw.  If you could just lift your legs for a second.  Continue to enjoy your meal while you lift your legs.  Sorry about what's happening. I  These are very nice shoes you got, you know?  Do they come in a 13 on the left and 11 on the right?  You know what? I'm just gonna go back to the kitchen.  LOUISE: Okay.  I think we're all happy to be past  the sheet metal phase.  - Are we in a union now? - Guys.  Only a pathetic little wall stands between us  and all the ceramics we could ever want to say we made.  Which is wrong.  Our grandparents might never know we didn't make their gifts,  but we will. A lie is not a gift.  Okay, your conscience needs to take a breather.  Also your breath needs to have a conscience.  I'm going to start sawing through this drywall.  You guys find a way to ditch the dust  without making anyone suspicious.  (sawing)  Man, all this dandruff is so embarrassing.  What's all this cocaine doing at school?  Throw it away.  Does anybody have any water for this baby formula?  No? Okay, I'll throw it out.  What's your deal, Tina?  Worry about your own damn deal, Jimmy Jr.  How are we doing in here?  (grunting)  Yes. Tina, flashlight.  (gasps) The legend. It's real.  I wouldn't say completely worth the absurd amount of effort.  But, yeah. (whistles)  Okay, back to sawing.  We're so close.  (straining): We are so  FROND: Busted.  Are those power tools?  Oh, good Lord, you are double busted.  But not triple busted. Phew. (chuckles)  FROND: This is very unlike you, Belchers.  Simple pranks, lackadaisical schoolwork, sure.  But demolishing school property on purpose?  With power tools? Power tools?  We're gonna need those back, by the way. I mean,  we don't know what you're talking about?  That poor locker.  All right, well, I need to contact your parents.  In the meantime, you are to sit and think  about what you've done.  We're gonna get expelled.  How do they do that?  Out of a cannon or something?  Wait, he took our flashlight.  That seems like a weird punishment. But fair.  Hey, he wait, he took our saw. But not the drill?  And why isn't he calling Mom and Dad in front of us?  He loves doing that.  Oh, my God. Come on.  (gasps) Look.  It's been sawed more.  Mr. Frond?  (hisses) You're supposed to be in my office.  G-Go away, children.  Where is it? Where is it?  - There it is. - What are you doing?  I don't want to talk about it, okay?  It's personal. (screams)  Don't touch that!  ""Seventh grade secretary.""  Dave Titus, check.  Phillip Frond, no check.  Here's another, here's another.  They're all the same.  - (moans) - What the ""H"" is going on here?  - Yeah, Frond, talk. - Fine.  When I was in seventh grade here at Wagstaff,  I ran for class secretary against Dave Titus.  - And because I was popularity-challenged,  - I was expected to lose. -   They were counting the votes in the ceramics room.  The teacher got up to go to the bathroom right when I happened  to be pacing in the hallway. I don't know what came over me,  but I grabbed a bunch of votes for Dave,  and stuffed them in a vase.  - (gasps) Whoa. - You cheated?  I was gonna hide the vase or-or confess, maybe.  But-but that weekend was the fire.  And they walled the room up.  Then, just like that, my greatest mistake  and my darkest secret was sealed up.  Welcome to my nightmare.  I beg you, do not tell anyone  about the unthinkable thing I did.  How about we don't get in any trouble at all,  and in return, we promise not to tell anyone.  - Deal? - Fine. Done.  And we each get to take a couple things off the shelf.  - Whatever. - It would ruin me if this got out.  I mean, who would listen to a guidance counselor that did this?  No one, that's who.  Mr. Frond, I-I think you've been holding  onto this secret when you don't have to.  This may sound crazy, but kids might listen to you more  if they knew that you made a big mistake when you were their age.  You know what, Tina? You're right.  That does sound crazy.  Nobody wants a relatable guidance counselor. Kids think I'm perfect.  That's why they listen to me.  Wait. Why did you break in here?  For the pottery. So we wouldn't have to make  presents for our grandparents.  - Ugh, really? - Really.  Then let's just take our horrible secrets,  push them down deep inside where they belong,  and go our separate ways, shall we?  Sounds great. Ooh.  That one has a certain Gene Ne sais quoi.  No. Damn it. Tina's right.  No, I think we covered this.  - Tina's wrong. - (sighs)  I don't want this kind of regret, you know?  I don't want to turn out like him.  - No, you don't. - You know?  - Like, look at you. - Yeah.  Ugh. I don't want to play these off as my own.  Not to my grandparents who might semi-treasure them.  A lie is a crappy gift.  That's great, Louise. See, Mr. Frond?  Louise learned from your mistake,  so she wouldn't have to make that mistake herself.  What are you even talking about?  Where do you get this stuff from?  So what are we gonna do now?  Learn origami real quick?  I might have an idea.  ROSE: (sniffs) It smells like smoky mold,  but it kind of works.  You're making me so hungry for cheese.  What do you think of my pinch pot?  It's, um, well, you made it.  I'm loving my mug. Uh  I'm loving my short vase.  - (Teddy scatting) - (sighs) Teddy, listen.  I-I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but  - Bob, we got to talk. - Okay.  It's just not working out, you know? It's it's you.  - Because you're a good guy, you know? - Uh-huh.  You're just you're tough to share a workspace with.  - You know what I mean? - Yeah, I get it. No, no. I  - Yeah, we're both perfectionists. - Yeah.  Me more than you, but yes.  Everything you're saying makes sense.  Not to mention you're always talking.  - Mm-hmm. - I'm trying to work,  - and you're talking. - Right.  - Bup, bup, bup, bup. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All-all-all good points.  So I'm just gonna do this phone stuff from home.  Unless you want to leave. Work at a different restaurant?  No, I'll-I'll probably stick here with this one.  - Yeah, your stuff's already here anyway, right? -Right, right.  - Eh - Seems more reasonable.  Okay, Ma, got to go.  Mwah, mwah, mwah.  Good luck with your glaucoma exam.  Don't cheat. (laughs) Oh, you hung up.  The grandparents loved your handmade presents.  - Nice job, kids. - Hey, Mom,  how come you're not wearing the necklace we made you?  - Oh, am I not wearing it? - Nope.  It's hard to tell if it's on.  - Put it on, woman. - Okay.  All right. (grunting)  - TINA: Little heavy? - Maybe a little. It's just a little  Hey, Dad, where's the gift we made you?  You mean this wet clump of clay?  We didn't know what you wanted. Dads are so hard to shop for.  Think of it as the gift card of handmade gifts.  - Thanks? - Aw, don't mention it.  Makin' it by hand for Gram and Gramps   Oh   Makin' it by hand for Gram and Gramps   Ooh   It's the thought that counts   -  Don't look too close  -  Oh   Makin' it by hand for Gram and Gramps   Makin' it by hand for Gram and Gramps   M-M-M-M-M-M-Makin' it by hand for Gram and Gramps   I said we're makin' it by hand for Gram and Gramps."
"1 Credit  So, last day of school before spring break.  You kids excited?  I am. I mean, because you'll be working  in the restaurant even more.  Whoo-hoo.  Is that the sound you make when you're happy?  It's horrible.  This spring break, I want to finally earn  my Thundergirls Something Thunderful badge.  It's for ""exemplifying the Thundergirl spirit  with an act of outstanding generosity or kindness.""  Whatever, hippie.  (sighs) But I can't seem to find  the right Thunderful project.  (straining): I'm not going this way!  Come on, this is happening.  Police!  I guess you might call this badge my Moby Dick.  I'll call anything Moby Dick.  - Moby Dick. - Gene.  Hey, Gene, how's that loose molar?  You feeling like maybe today's the day, are you?  It feels pretty ready.  But it's got a mind of its own.  Ugh, I can't stand the waiting.  - Let me wiggle it. - (shouts)  I saw her do this to a woman at the grocery store once.  It's Gene's last baby tooth.  When I get it, I'll have the full set.  Remind me again why you collect Gene's teeth?  You remember, when Gene was little,  he was scared of the Tooth Fairy.  You know, sneaking into his room at night  when he's sleeping, and taking stuff.  If that's what I wanted, I'd get an ex-girlfriend.  So Gene started giving me the teeth, and I pay him in kisses.  (coughs): Rip-off.  And soon I'll have 'em all.  Ugh, I can't stand the waiting.  - Gimme. - Ow!  Lin, let Gene eat breakfast.  This is breakfast.  - Nom, nom, nom, nom. - Ow, Gene, ow.  So, where's everybody going for spring break?  We're going to a place where you can stand  in four states at once.  I'm gonna stand in California,  Hawaii, Canada, and Chicago.  I'm going on a road trip with my grandma.  She's gonna let me work the gas pedal  'cause she's too weak to push it.  My dad is taking us to Cooperstown.  - We go every year. - The Baseball Hall of Fame.  The what?  I'm going on a cruise with my parents to Turks and Caicos.  Oh, my God. Turks and Caicos?  Little bit of Turks, lot of Caicos.  And I'll be going to here-ish.  I'm trying to earn my Something Thunderful  Oh, you know who's gonna be on my cruise ship?  BFOTs.  Boys from other towns.  Tammy, you're gonna smooch a BFO  on the pointy part of the boat just like in Titanic.  I might also go to the beach and watch seagulls fight over bread.  You're not going anywhere?  You're so lucky you don't mind having a super boring life.  I guess I am. Oh.  I thought I liked bread, but those seagulls love bread.  Oh, my God. I think it's time.  It's happening.  My last baby tooth.  Aah, that's not a breadcrumb!  So that's the Tooth Fairy.  What'll I tell Mom?  Tell her it's gone to a better place a seagull's butt.  - (horn blows) - TINA: There goes Tammy's cruise ship.  At least I won't have to hear her annoying voice for a week.  TAMMY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Stop, stop, stop!  You forgot me!  Hey, Tammy, why aren't you on the boat?  I was on it, Tina.  I got on with my parents, they went to the cabin,  but I got off to buy lip gloss  because the boat didn't have my brands.  That's lip gloss?  I thought you'd always just finished  eating rotisserie chicken.  Daddy, it's me.  Tammy, where are you? The outfit I laid out for you  - is still on the bed. - I'm not on the boat.  - I'm on the land! - What?  I need you to march up to the captain, make your voice deeper,  and tell him to turn that boat around.  I'm not sure cruise ships can turn around.  They have to go around the world or something.  (cries) What am I supposed to do?  Um, swim for it?  It's that dot out there, right? You can make it.  - Who are you with? - No one. Nobody.  - The Belchers. - Okay, I'll go talk to someone.  You go wait at their house.  (sobs) It's an apartment!  Oh, God. I-I'll call you right back.  Uh, yeah, yeah, Tammy's here now.  - She's so here. - (huffing)  Here's our problem, Bob. The only way off the ship early  is by medevac, and I get airsick.  That's why we're on a cruise to begin with.  (whispers): Can we get another round?  (normal voice): Uh, so listen  we've called everyone.  All your friends and family are on different fun cruises.  - FEMALE VOICE: Psst, Tina, down here. - What?  Ask her to stay with you.  That would be generous and kind, hmm?  Are you freaking kidding me? She's a monster.  That's what would make it Thunderful.  - Then you take her. - Listen, kid, do you want me or not?  You know I want you. Stupid badge.  Tina, honey, who are you talking to?  (sighs) What if Tammy stays with us?  - No, thank you. -Eh. -No. -No. - Mm-mm, mm-mm.  It's the only solution.  Dad, tell Tammy's dad we've got this.  Tammy, welcome to our home.  - Ew. - It's not a cruise,  but you might catch a stomach thing.  So, Tammy, a big extra special helping for you,  - our guest. - Nope.  Uh, what's the matter with it, Tammy?  Um, it rhymes with ""schmeverything.""  No offense, but I just don't eat food that's homemade.  (through teeth): Could we get you something else, sweetie?  Mm, that's okay, I'll just order in.  Do places deliver here, or is the neighborhood too dangerous?  Oh, it's super safe except for that huge unsolved murder  that's gonna happen.  - LINDA: Tammy! - What?  LINDA: Okay, every towel's on the floor.  Relax. You're out of hot water, so no one's gonna need a towel.  Where's the blow-dryer?  - Right there. - (scoffs) I was asking  for the person, not the thing.  Oh, your mom blow-dries your hair?  Only when my dad's out of town.  I'm not doing it.  There are too many tangles!  Use the detangler!  Ugh, what's ""detangler""?  I hope these sofa cushions are comfortable, Tammy.  Oh, Tina, you don't have to do that.  Well, I'm just being generous and Thunderful, and  Hey, hey, wh-what are you doing?  Uh, I assume I'm sleeping here  - and you're sleeping down there. - Then why'd you say,  ""Oh, you don't have to put cushions down""?  I just thought you could sleep on the floor without cushions.  Okay. Um  Tammy, how's your night-farting?  (yawns) I don't night-fart.  (farting)  - (yawns) - GENE: Dad.  - Wh-Wh-What is it, Gene? - I lost my tooth.  Oh, that's good news. Lin.  No, no. I lost lost it.  Okay, uh, let's be calm.  We'll-we'll feel her out a little.  Maybe she'll be cool.  What? What's up? What do you want?  Uh, so, the Gene baby tooth collection  Oh, you mean my perfect little Gene mouth in a jar?  Sometimes I talk to it. And if I bury it in the woods,  I bet a little boy would come up.  - (chuckles) What about it? - Nothing. - I forget.  Hi, I'm just taking a breather.  From farts. To breathe.  Yeah. How are we gonna get through this Tammy week?  - Drink? - Alcohol does not solve problems, Miss Missy.  It just makes them go away.  Guys, come on. We can do this.  It's only four more days.  Is this barf? Barf.  My show's on.  (laughs)  Why are you so bad at this?  I thought I was getting better!  - It's only three and a half more days. - No, enough.  We're gonna have a little Tammy-vention.  Tammy, can you come out here, please?  Okay, everyone stare at me.  You wear glasses?  No, I wear contacts, which I am out of.  So I had to put these on,  and now my face is totally Tina-ed!  (quietly): Badge, badge, badge, badge.  - Tammy, we need to talk. - It's okay.  - I think I know what this is about. - Oh, good.  Being more polite and grateful and helpful.  (sighs) I know you guys think you're doing your best,  but you could work on all three of these things.  Oh, my God.  Tammy, we're not a hotel.  Yeah, and we're not a restaurant.  - Right. - Actually, we are a restaurant.  But not a good one.  Right. I-I mean, the point is,  Tammy, in our house, kids help out.  And we think you might kind of appreciate other people  and things, uh, if you pitched in a little.  You know, work.  Work?  Like, where?  So I think you'll like working here. -(moaning)  - My coworkers are pretty fun. - Mom's the office flirt.  She does get a little grabby at the Christmas party.  That's true.  This isn't happening.  I hate to haze you on your first day but, uh,  mind passing me that ketchup?  - What? - It's the red bottle right there.  - I'm sorry, I'm just not - Right-right by your hand.  Sorry. Okay. Actually, if you could start over.  - Right - You may even be touching it.  - Just put your fing right behind - I just I I don't  You just you're you're right by it.  - I (moans) - You know, I got mustard here.  - I'm g-gonna I'm gonna do that. - I'm just  Yeah, I'm gonna go on break.  What? Tammy, you haven't done anything yet.  (crying): This isn't the spring break  I was supposed to be having.  I was supposed to be kissing BFOTs on a boat.  Now I've got bad hair and glasses.  Damn it, Tammy, get it together.  You've lasted two minutes.  This is my life.  Ew! (crying)  (bell jingles)  Hey, hey, hey, restaurant girl.  Don't cry. What's wrong?  - I just wanted to take a break. - But  You poor dirty-faced thing. Here's a handkerchief.  I carry one in case I run into sad humans. Or boogers.  - Who are you? - Who are you?  I'm Brett, I'm picking up an order.  Oh, that's coming right up. Did you order one  ""grandpa style""? I-I don't know what that is.  Yeah, it's how my grandpa orders his burgers.  I guess it's just mashed up.  I'm in town visiting my grandfather this week.  - Here. - Wow, you really filled this up.  I like that.  At my private school in Bethesda,  I never get to meet down-to-earth girls  who work in restaurants and really blow their nose.  (quietly): Geez, Tina.  A boy comes in here looking for a girl  who works in a restaurant with lots of snot,  and he doesn't meet you.  Bethesda? Is that where Jesus is from?  Ha. You're different.  Me, too.  So, same as you.  Is this your family's restaurant?  No, my family left me with these people.  And now I work here.  Technically true. I got to allow it.  Here's your order.  We treat Tammy very well.  And now I have to go.  Because I ordered this to go.  I wrote my number on a napkin. Here.  Oh, are we exchanging numbers? Uh, hold on.  I've got one. It's the emergency phone,  but if it's, uh oh, you're gone.  Hey, it's my best friend, Peter Pescadero.  I'm gonna go give him a high five.  So, you got a fresh molar for me?  I did, Gene, but I got a better offer.  Hogarth Haber needed a tooth for a science experiment  where you drop it in soda and see if it dissolves.  I'll pay double.  Whatever double one dollar is.  It's too late, Gene, it's gone.  It dissolved so fast.  Soda's not good, man.  TAMMY: Okay, so, Brett's a little bit  - Perfect, I know. -  weird.  But he's supes cute and a BFOT,  and I'm going to salvage this crap spring break  - by smooching him. - (phone vibrates)  Uh, right on schedge.  ""I'm smelling my burger wrapper and thinking of you.""  Blah, blah, blah.  ""Also, how come a day can be sunny,  but a night can't be moony?"" Eh?  (gasps) That's a frickin' great text.  And I will text back  An emoji of a high-heeled shoe?  Tammy, you have to put words to your feelings.  Like the word ""shoe""?  Why don't you say, ""Hi, Brett. Do you ever think  that shoulders are the butts of the arms?""  You know, normal stuff like that.  ""Hi, uh ""  Ugh, you just write it, Tina.  Me? Okay.  I mean, a little extra Thundergirl generosity, I guess.  - Word it up. (phone vibrates) - Oh, a reply.  ""Do you think if snakes wore pants,  - it would just be a sock?"" - (snores, farts)  Maybe I should just handle this.  - (phone vibrating) - (laughs) Oh, Brett.  (yawns) Tina, what are you doing?  Oh, you're up. Uh, okay, so some news.  One, you have a date with Brett. Yay.  Two, you should catch up on a couple texts.  Oh, my God, there are hundreds.  Yeah, you got a little carried away.  ""If you could be any kind of furniture, what would it be?  - I'd be a love seat""? - I know, good stuff.  I can't talk like this.  How am I gonna get through this date?  Brett thinks I'm this dorky weirdo.  No, he doesn't, he thinks you're me. Oh.  It's almost like I need to borrow your weird personality.  Wait, how would that work?  You've come to the right person.  Uh, we didn't come to you at all.  Yeah, you just walked in here without knocking.  There wasn't time for you guys to figure out you needed me.  Fortunately, the walls are thin.  I think some of your walls are just wallpaper.  We can pull this off.  And all it's gonna take is a couple telephones,  ear-buds, a little luck, big hats, potted plants,  more luck, precision timing,  some sort of a distraction, and a little luck.  - Sounds doable. - Well, I wouldn't go that far.  But if it doesn't work, at least it'll fail enjoyably.  If you need a distraction, how 'bout these wubba-wubbas?  Here's how it works. You guys call each other,  leave the line open. The BFOT says something.  Tammy's phone picks it up, transmits it to Tina,  bypassing Tammy's brain.  Tina replies into her phone.  Tammy repeats those words exactly,  again bypassing Tammy's brain.  At no time is Tammy's brain used, understood?  - Yes. - Not at all. - We're ready.  So that's my favorite horse movie  or movie containing horses. What about you?  My favorite of those movies I've known about way before now is  - Haunches of Glory. - Haunches of Glory.  Oh, I loved the ads.  ""Raise the roof for this hoof.""  Is that your boss' daughter in there?  Ugh. Yeah, spying on me. So creepy.  (chuckles) Gonna drag me back to work probably.  Hey, she's not your slave!  And that cloud looks like Gandhi in a gondola. Am I crazy?  I got a cloud that looks like a butt at two o'clock.  What do you know? Another butt cloud.  - Aah! My phone's dying. - You're cutting out.  - Hmm? - Carbs. Or at least I am. (laughs)  Oh, boy, she's flying solo.  (sighs) So  Coo uh, yes.  Cuh-ca  I can tell that you have so much to say. Just say it.  Ugly people.  Are bad?  - I don't - Aah! I have yogurt diarrhea. Bye!  That actually went a lot better than I thought it would.  BOB: Hi, Dr. Yap.  - We called about the tooth? - Not here, Bob.  The coffee shop across the street. More privacy.  - But - I said coffee shop.  They have booths and light jazz. It's super nice.  That jazz better be damn light, buddy.  (light jazz playing)  - Here's my inventory. - GENE: Aah!  Where's the rest of Michael Caine, you monster?!  Oh, my God. We-we want a baby tooth.  I don't extract baby teeth, Bob.  I yank gross, diseased adult teeth.  Uh, I guess this one, then.  Ooh, you have a good eye.  Smells like cigarette smoke and Barbasol.  All right, how much?  - Whatever you think is fair. - Free?  Let's say 50 bucks.  - (scoffs) I'll give you ten. - Deal.  TAMMY: I panicked.  I didn't know what to say.  I wasn't following the conversation.  I thought Brett was super easy to talk to.  Especially for someone I wasn't actually talking to.  That's why we're a good team, Tina.  I'm the face, you're the gunk behind the face.  But what if the gunk has feelings for Brett, also?  - I'm confused. - I like Brett. A lot.  (scoffs) You don't even know him, Tina.  Actually, I think I do know him.  You know what? Use it. Use your dumb feelings.  Get that BFOT on my kiss spot.  BRETT: Beautiful lady.  I hope this is your bedroom.  It's Brett! Ow!  - Why'd you run away? - Um Please.  BADGE: This is where the Thunder-rubber  meets the Thunder-road. What's it gonna be, hotshot?  (sighs) I was afraid of how much we have in common.  I was afraid of how much sodium's in ramen?  Louder!  You know what? Just stand there and move your mouth.  TINA: I guess what I'm trying to say, Brett, is,  it's a moony night.  Do you sound different?  Nope. Anyway, I like you,  and there's just you and me here.  Two hearts, two mouths.  - Four lips. - Sink ships.  In the math of the heart, that equals kiss.  - How do I get up there? - I have a fire ladder. I'll come down.  Nice job, Tina.  (Brett and Tammy kissing loudly)  - Whoa. - Ugh  So, are we just gonna keep watching, or ?  Keep watching.  - Okay, I'll get a chair. - Get me one, too.  Sorry, Tina. I thought this was gonna go disastrously wrong,  - not disgustingly right. - Ugh!  Where's this gonna end?  - I - Do.  - You do. -  do.  What a great honeymoon.  What a great honeymoon.  Come on, push.  - (Tina grunts) - (Tammy grunts)  (baby cries)  I don't like it. I don't like it.  Whew! Are my lips still on? (laughs)  Okay, here's the news.  Brett is taking me to dinner tomorrow,  and I think he's on the verge of asking me  to be his out-of-town girlfriend.  Out-of-town girlfriend. You mean ?  I'm gonna be an OOTGF!  I knew you'd either end up an astronaut or that.  Here's what I need. Some kind of smarty-boobs speech  that gets him over the hump.  Like, ""Hey, Brett, bleep, bloo, bluh, in conclusion, OOTGF.""  - Have fun with it. - Tammy, I'm out.  I can't do it anymore.  Uh excuse me?  It's not fair. I think Brett likes me.  You're Milli Vanilli,  and I'm those super-talented studio musicians  that probably had to sleep in the same room as Milli Vanilli  while Milli Vanilli farted up the place.  Oh, step off, girl. He is mine.  So you just keep away from him,  and you just keep telling me what to say to him.  - I won't. - You will.  - I won't. - You - Will!  Tina, you can't abandon Tammy this late in the game.  - That's not Thunderful. - But  Tammy just wants you to put some more words in her mouth.  You can think up some interesting words, right?  Oh. Um, all right, I'll do it.  Good. Keep it happy and snappy.  This plaque's really baked on.  We've just got to get it down to size.  And then we go after the mole on Dad's butt.  - Gene. - Sorry. Beauty mark on Dad's butt.  Bob, what's the racket down there?  Oh, we're just, uh, making jewelry for your birthday.  Oh, oh, I don't want to see! I don't want to see!  Uh, but when you do see it,  it's gonna look store-bought and sensibly priced.  - Hi, milady. Ready for our date? - Yeah, let's go.  - And we're here. - Welcome to Bob's Burgers.  Let me show you to your table.  I'm kind of surprised you want to come here, Tammy.  Tonight she's not a dirty employee. She's a dirty guest.  We can literally go anywhere else.  Well, you're here, so, enjoy.  I'll be your server tonight.  If you need anything, especially napkins, Tammy, let me know.  Here are some to get you started.  Eh? Oh.  ""Forget the side of fries.  I want my side to be this guy by my side.""  I also do want fries.  It's still so yellow.  We-we have to paint it white or something.  Which white? There are a lot of whites, Bob.  Don't tell a handyman you want white.  I don't know. Um, tooth white?  ""Tooth white."" Uh, l-let me, let me get out the chips here.  There's Lily White, Winter White.  Ooh, Oyster Whisper? That's a pretty one.  Whatever Gene's teeth are.  Or we pick a white we're all excited about  and throw a coat of that on Gene's teeth.  I want Tighty Whitey white.  We're not painting Gene's mouth.  Oh, boo.  I'll never forget the last few days uh  Oops. I spilled my water.  - More napkins here! - Here we are.  ""And soon you'll be going back to Bethesda.""  Oop. Ha. Look at that. I spilled your water.  Maybe more than one napkin this time?  LINDA: Tammy's really going through the paper goods over there.  She's the same with TP.  She really lays down a nest.  ""Soon, I'll be out of town from you.""  That's a weird way to say that.  I love it.  You do? Uh  ""But what if I had a totally different face?""  Super cool hypothetical.  ""And even if I was slightly taller than you thought I was  ""and I didn't put on eye shadow  like I was frosting a fricking wedding cake ""  What the hell is going on here?  Yeah, I'm not sure what you're saying.  I'm sure I'm gonna say something different in a minute.  As soon as I get a new napkin over here!  I'm really sorry. It looks like we're out of napkins.  Well, that's kind of a problem for me now because  I need one!  - That is a huge mess. - She really is.  Ah, forget it. I'm out.  I'm out, too, Brett of the closet.  The whole time you were talking to me, not Tammy.  What do you mean, grumpy napkin girl?  I've been speaking to you through her,  and now you and I are together. Hi, I'm Tina.  (gasps) This whole thing It was a Cyrano de Burger-ac!  Cyra-yes de Burger-ac.  - I I'm kind of upset. - I get it.  Let's just go walk on the beach and talk, mouth to mouth.  I told my grandpa about you. I mean her.  - I mean - Shh, shh, shh.  - You're all up in here. - You guys tricked me.  Okay, you know what? Frankly,  you didn't have to be that easy to trick.  What? You know, this stuff doesn't happen in Bethesda.  People there just say their own words.  What about when Tammy's voice changed completely?  You just kind of went with that,  Mr. Handsome Hears What He Wants.  TAMMY: Guys, guys?  Woof. I have something to say.  And these are my actual words, I think.  You seem to have some gross chemistry,  and you both make me tired, so  just go walk together on the beach already.  I guess it wouldn't kill us.  Great. Let's go. I got my coat on while Tammy was talking.  Oh, I'm actually working tonight.  Ugh! I'll (scoffs)   do nasty restaurant stuff for you, Tina.  Thanks, Tammy. Maybe you're the one  that deserves a Something Thunderful badge.  - Who cares? That thing is stupid. - Good. Phew.  All right, hand me that dish loofah.  - This is a sponge. - What are you saying?  - ""Spawnge""? - Sponge!  Spawnge.  (clears throat) Gene.  Oh, what have we here?  Oh. Oh, my God, is it time?

I want bourbon.  Wait. What's going on?  Um, we bought a dead man's tooth.  - Maybe not dead, but not well. - Why?  Because Gene lost lost his last baby tooth,  and we didn't know how to tell you.  Please don't write me out of your will.  - I want those sweaters! - Oh, it's okay, Gene.  I was missing a few of your teeth anyway.  - What? - It's hard to keep a full set.  You know, you take 'em out and play with them,  they get lost. It's like Legos.  Oh, my God, we spent so much time on this.  Looks like the ocean's out tonight.  Hey, look, it's waving at you.  Damn, we're gonna kiss.  - (seagull squawks) - Oh, my God,  did that seagull just cough up a tooth?  Oh, uh, let me get that for my mom.  - What? - No, it can wait.  TAMMY:  I'm the one who isn't a nerd   TINA:  I'm the one who thinks up the words   TAMMY:  I'm the face   TINA:  You fart up the place   BOTH:  But we got that BFOT right on the kiss spot   TAMMY:  I'm the one who drives him insane   TINA:  Only when I bypass your brain   TAMMY:  I'm adorbs   TINA:  You made me sleep on the floor   BOTH:  But we got the BFOT on the kiss spot   TINA: Take it, Tammy.  TINA:  Poop, poop, poopy-poop, poop, poop, poop   Poop-poop, poop, pa-poopy-poop   -  Doop-a-poopy-poop - Happier and snappier.  (Tina blows raspberries rhythmically)  TAMMY: Less farty."
"1  Hey, what would happen if we put ketchup in the mustard bottles?  Oh, man. I don't even want to think about it.  Ah! Dad! They're showing a commercial for the marathon!  ANNOUNCER: Starting at 11:00 a.m., it's an all-out,  body-slammin', thank you ma'am-in'  ten straight hours of Supreme Extreme Champions!  - Ten hours is almost not enough. - All of your favorite obstacles  and the ultimate challenge,  - the Stampede! - LOUISE AND BOB: The Stampede!    BOB AND LOUISE: Do the steamroller! Do the steamroller! Yes!  I mean, if you're gonna get through the Stampede,  - you got to steamroll. - Obviously.  That spandex doesn't leave much to the imagination, huh?  - (phone rings) - No, there's still a little bit to imagine.  Bob's Burgers. This isn't Bob.  Hi, this is Walter Rubens from the Gold Dragons.  The Gold Dragons? What is that, a gang?  No, it's-it's your daughter Louise's soccer team.  Louise has a soccer team?  Oh, God, we signed Louise up for soccer.  You what?!  Hey, look, an e-mail from Harley's dad.  He's asking if Louise would want to join Harley's soccer team.  Think she would?  I've met Louise, so probably not.  Louise, do you want to sign up for soccer?!  LOUISE (sarcastically): Yes! Please sign me up for soccer!  - Oh! - She's being sarcastic.  Are you being sarcastic?!  - (sarcastically): No! - Aw, yeah, you're right.  Well, wait, now I'm not so sure. Louise,  do you want to sign up for soccer?!  (sarcastically): Uh-huh!  I guess she wants to do it.  Should we double-triple-check?  No, I-I don't want to yell anymore.  I was being sarcastic.  I'm sorry! It was I  We got a-an e-mail, and I  Oh! Oh, I didn't realize you got an e-mail!  I completely forgot it happened at all!  It was during wine time!  Guys, guys, shush, shush, shush.  We really need Louise to play this morning.  Suzy's on vacation and Michaela's sick  - and Jamie's gerbil died. - Aw!  It was his time. Anyway, if Louise doesn't come,  we won't have enough players and we'll have to forfeit.  - Oh! - And since it's the last game of the season  and Louise hasn't come to a single one,  this is literally the least you can do.  Last game? She missed the whole season?  - Yes. - Okay. You know what, Walter, she'll be there.  (gasps)  Louise, come on. Let's get changed.  - Uh-uh, uh-uh. - Oh, God.  Okay, she went limp. Come on, we got a rag doll.  - Let's go. Come on, come on. - No  Come on!   o!  That was not easy.  I know this seems horrible, Louise,  but you did sign up. Sort of.  No, you signed me up,  and now you're bowing to grown-up peer pressure!  What's next, taking fish oil? Paying taxes?  Plus, you might not hate every single second of it?  Yeah, but what about the Supreme Extreme Champions marathon?  Without that, what's the point of anything?  We could DVR it. If we had one.  Should we just push a bunch of buttons on the remote?  That's how I saw 9 1/2 Weeks.  You'll still get to see some of the marathon  when you're back, Louise. A-And, besides,  lots of parents make their kids play sports.  And for a reason.  - I think. Right, Lin? - P-Probably! Who can say?  Very convincing.  Come on, Louise, you're going.  All right, I'll go.  Who's driving me to this sucker game?  - Your mother will take you. - Your dad is gonna take you.  I don't want to go.  - I don't want to go either, Bob. - Thumb war?  BOTH: One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war.  - Damn it. - Yes!  So glad I married a man with dainty thumbs.  They're beautiful, but they're useless.  Well, Louise, I guess let's go to your soccer game.  How about I come along? ""Great idea, Tina.  Looks like Tina's coming. Yay!""  And I'll stay here, 'cause it sounds like  where you're going is outside.  BOB: Wow, crowded.  Yeah, like ""maybe we won't be able to find  a parking spot"" crowded?  Oh, right. If we can't find a spot,  we'd have to go home. That's not our fault.  - No. Not at all. - Oh, there's one.  - Ah, wonderful. - Thanks, Tina.  TEDDY: So, where's Bob today, Lin?  Doctor's appointment? Grocery store?  (gasps) Did you kick him to the curb?  Anything you need, Linda.  I'm here, I'm not leaving.  You say the word, I move my stuff in here.  Teddy, no. Teddy, Teddy, Teddy!  Bob took Louise to her soccer game,  and Tina went, too, that's all.  Oh, good. What a great dad.  While they're gone, I'm flying solo with my Gene-o.  Taking a jamma with my mamma.  (gasps) ""Jamma with my mamma""?  Oh, my God.  Gene, is today the day we do the  - What? - The piano bar.  (gasps) The piano bar!  We said we would do it if your dad ever left us alone again.  - What are you guys talking about? - Gene and Linda's Piano Bar  Show Tunes and Mouth Foods.  It's been our dream forever.  BOTH:  Give my regards   To old Broadway   And say that I'll be there e'er long.   I'll go get my keyboard.  Oh, and get all my dresses and wigs.  But what'll you wear?  Um, hi. Is this the Gold Dragons?  My daughter is, uh, one of them.  Yes. You must be Bob. I'm Walter.  Here's your jersey. It's been in my car for nine weeks.  It's listened to a lot of NPR.  LOUISE: N-P-U.  Do you have cleats and shin guards?  Uh, we don't have any of those things.  Of course not. (sighs)  I guess, uh, books are sort of shin-guardy.  If you want, you can borrow my Grishams.  Oh, good. I don't feel like an orphan  who stumbled onto the field at all.  - Why is that guy looking at me so much? - Brag.  - So, you coaching today? - Oh, I forgot to tell you,  - you're coaching today. - Me? Oh-oh, no.  No, definitely not.  Suzy's dad is normally the coach, but Suzy's on vacation,  so he's on vacation, too.  Classic Suzy's dad.  And you kind of owe it to us for being M.I.A.  - the whole season. - W-W-Wait, sorry.  I can't coach. Can anyone else do it?  Maybe someone who's been here or knows anything about soccer?  - Like you? - No. I set up the goals.  Plus Ow. Ow, ow! My hand.  Uh, Bob, hold the clipboard.  - Bob's coaching. - What?!  Oh, I see you got the clipboard.  - Congrats, Coach. - Oh, come on.  I don't know how to coach.  Dad (echoing Bob)  you might not hate  every single second of it.  Evil child. All right.  - How bad can it be? - Coach, will you fix my ponytail?  Uh, I don't know how to  Coach, something went wrong with my cleats.  - Can you fix them? - Coach, I can't be goalie.  I can't touch the ball with my hands.  - Oh, my God. - Coach, should I live  - with my mom or my dad? - Help!  Yeah, a little help over here look at him.  You're doing great, Dad.  Why is this happening?  There isn't even anything written on this clipboard.  Hey, Coach, um, aren't you gonna get us  to stretch and do drills and stuff?  Right, uh, why don't you guys, um,  kick the ball back and forth.  Wow, you sure you haven't done this before?  Dad, I'd like to apply for the position of assistant coach.  You probably have a lot of offers, but  Great, you're hired. Here's a clipboard  - with nothing on it. - Yes.  - Doesn't matter. Leave it. - Roger that.  BOB: Oof.  They look good.  This is gonna be bad.  Whoa. I kinda want their autographs.  Hey, there, I'm Christy, coach of the Blue Dragons.  - Ow, my hand hurts. - I know.  Uh, wait, the-the Blue Dragons? We're the Gold Dragons.  Are all the teams just different colored dragons?  Yep. Or thunders. Different colored thunders.  There's a Brown Thunder, which is unfortunate.  - Yeah. - Look, I just wanted to wish you good luck.  This is all gonna be over soon enough. (laughs)  W-Wait, what? What does that mean?  You know, I am glad you're here, Louise.  I wondered why you never came to practices or games,  and I always wanted to ask you at school,  but honestly I'm scared of you, and I did not.  But isn't this just the best, though?  (groans) Yup. Love soccer.  ALL:  Till we meet again.   - (door opens, bells jingle) - Ms. Merkin, hello.  What are you doing out in the wild?  Hello, Gene. I was just going for a walk.  Needed to blow off some steam.  I saw your sign. I'll go into any joint  that says ""piano"" on it.  Gene, you want to introduce us to your lady friend?  This is Ms. Merkin, the music teacher from school.  We call her Twerkin' Merkin.  Oh, I didn't recognize you without a piano covering your legs.  - MERKIN: Where's your piano? - Right here.  Ugh, that little jingleberry?  You making fart sounds, or are you really playing it?  - (plays chord and fart) - Both.  Not bad. Shove over.  (plays jazz riff)  (plays fart) - Wow. - Yeah!  Whoa, look at you. Is there a Mr. Merkin?  (whistle blowing)  BOB: Oh, the game's starting.  Louise, go that way. Other girl, go that way.  Guys, you're all standing in a clump right next to each other.  It's so different from what the other team is doing.  - (whistle blows) - MAN: Come on, play the ball!  - Oh, my God, they scored right away. - Little slow, Kayla.  Little slow? That was so fast.  Did we start?  That's all right, girls. Keep hustling!  And have fun out there.  Coach, uh, one thought. Maybe we should have  someone in goal. I don't know, just sayin'.  Uh, yeah, yeah. Good idea, Tina.  Hey, someone get in goal. No, just one!  ALL:  By the beautiful sea   What should I play next?  Ooh, how 'bout that show  that's coming to the community theater  TSA: The Musical?  - Oh, I love the soundtrack. - Me, too.  TSA's the best musical about a government agency ever written!  - I-I don't know that one. - Really? ""Female Pat Down""?  ""Whose Bag Is This""? ""If You See Something, Sing Something""?  All right! ""Female Pat Down.""  Let me see if I can remember.  (muttering)  Wow, you're remembering the crap out of that song.  ALL:  It takes a lady   To touch a lady   But it takes a woman to touch my heart   KAYLA (panting): 2-0.  - You guys want a Benadryl? - What? Why?  'Cause it seems like you're all allergic to the ball.  Oh, okay. You're, like, a super cool sports girl  doing trash talk good job.  I got more where that came from,  - Pink Ears Book Legs. - (whistle blows)  (grunting)  - Oh, no. Oh, no. - You can do it, Mara.  No, no, no, no. Aah!  Oh, good try, Mara with your face.  MARA: Is it still on?  Yeah, I mean, don't, don't look at it for a while.  - But it - MARA: Ow  You've probably always had that soccer ball pattern  on your forehead.    Parents make their kids do this for a reason   Parents make their kids do this for a reason   Is it 'cause they hate their children?   Parents make their kids do this for a reason.   ALL:  And that's whose bag it is.   Oh, okay, how 'bout we do something  from a different musical?  Aw, why not keep playing this one?  Everyone loves it.  - Well, I don't love it, okay?! - (piano clangs)  I don't love it!  - Whoa. - Why don't you love it,  - Ms. Merkin? - I don't want to talk about it.  Well, if she doesn't want to talk about it  All right, I'll tell you!  I've been playing piano for the community theater's  production of TSA.  - (gasps) What?! - What?!  But then the damn lead actress  said I was missing cues and playing off-tempo.  So I quit, and I'm never going back.  No, Ms. Merkin, we're never going back.  Well, it's my Jo I don't Who is Who is he?  7-0. Close game.  What's your next move, big man?  (whistle blows)  End of the first quarter.  Okay, so talk to me about these quarters.  How many more we got? One, zero  - Three. - No  - Yeah. - Not what I was hoping for.  I know.  Only three more goals  before your team gets shutouted.  Sorry, I don't speak ""mean jock girl."" What are you saying?  If the score gets to 10-0,  the game is automatically over,  which is automatically embarrassing for you.  Wait, like the game would be over over?  Like I could go home?  Yeah, back to the bookstore that your legs live in.  That's amazing. I mean, oh, no.  Definitely don't want that to happen.  Mm-Kay.  That would be very disappointing. Thank you.  (quietly): Hey, you hear about this shutout rule thing?  Yeah. Three more goals, and we're on our way back  to Supreme Extreme Champions town.  - That's my favorite town. - I know.  So I guess we just keep doing what we're doing?  You got it, Coach.  Let's just be a little discreet about this?  Me be discreet You be discreet.  - BOB: Yes! - LOUISE: Yes!  I-I mean, that's all right. That's all right.  Yeah, we-we'll get 'em. We-We'll get 'em.  Oh no! She stole the ball from me!  Why?!  It's hard to explain, Louise.  Why does anyone steal the ball from anyone?  Yeah, I just don't want to lose, you know?  - And go home so soon. - Hey, Coach.  Really sorry this game might be over so quickly.  It's just hard to get my girls to ease up.  (chuckles) It's like telling a shark  not to eat the saddest school of fish.  - That's your team. - Right.  'Cause if you look at them, they look really sad.  - Right, right, right, yeah. - And we're so strong.  Yeah, I know. I got the analogy.  Is there a problem here? Hey, lady coach,  why don't you go dribble something, huh?  I'm walking away because I want to.  Keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.  I can't believe you quit TSA: The Musical.  What are you gonna do now, just teach music to kids? Yuck.  Well, they won't have Matilda Merkin to kick around anymore.  And their dumb CD player won't complain  if they treat it like crap.  I hope it skips.  (gasps) They're doing the show to a recording?  That's Off-Broadway blasphemy.  Yep. And they're gonna burn in hell for it.  Now, if you'll excuse me,  I'm going to improvise a sad song. (humming)  Um, piano bar manager meeting, Gene?  Did I just get promoted to manager?  I'm not ready.  We got to get Ms. Merkin back in that show.  Guys, I don't want to crash your manager meeting,  but I was wondering if I could just shadow Gene, maybe? Sit in?  - Sure, sure. - But, Mom,  if we don't get her back in the show,  she can live here with us forever.  Piano bar every day and all night, I'm assuming.  Great managing, Gene.  For the good of musicals everywhere,  we got to make this right.  (groans) Fine.  Uh, excuse me for a second.  Just gonna take the phone into the kitchen, here, now.  Hey, while you're back there, any chance I could get a burger?  Oh, yeah, we make food.  Okay, got that out of my system.  Now, who likes Oklahoma!?  - (cheering) - Ooh, ooh, me!  (grunts, panting)  - Out of my way. - You got it, K-dog.  Good hustle!  Just have fun out there!  Oh, God, not again.  (shouts)  Yes. I mean  (groaning): Oh, darn!  That's 9-0.  Stage is set for a comeback.  - MAN: Good hustle! - Just have fun out there!  I feel like they just keep saying the same thing  over and over again.  TINA: Hey, sideline, switch it up.  Yeah, you, mom jeans.  Shutouted coach says what?  - What? - (laughing): Yeah.  Hey, Coach Christy, out of curiosity, which one's your car?  I'll be right back. Dad, can I borrow your keys?  - Tina, no. - (grunting)  Tina, let go.  What are you doing here?  Some lady called the theater while we were rehearsing  and said you wanted to come back,  so we came because we want you back.  - It was me, I'm the lady. - Yeah, you are.  What? I never said that.  Matilda, we can't do the show without you.  We thought putting the wig on the CD player  would make it better, but it just made it worse.  I'm not coming back unless Sheila apologizes.  And I don't see her here, so  - Oh, I'm here. - (gasping)  But I'm not apologizing.  Oh, my God, I love the theater.  - (whistle blows) - Is the game over?  No, it's just halftime.  So, how long is halftime?  If everyone's feeling good, can we just skip it, or  You're running for the Porta Potties.  All right, talk to you when you get out.  Well, better start packing it in, huh, ladies?  I hate getting shutouted.  Me, too.  I want to play the rest of the game.  What? We're getting killed.  - You want to keep going? - Well, yeah, it's still fun.  I mean, I don't like when the ball comes to me,  but that's so rare.  Even you, Jodi?  I mean, you look terrified out there.  Mm, I like it. Some people go on roller coasters,  I sign up for soccer every year.  It makes me feel alive.  I just wish we didn't get shutouted every game.  W-Wait, you guys get shutouted every game?  Yeah. I don't even think they had the rule until this season.  They invented it just for us.  - Halfway through our first game. - Yeah.  The other name for getting shutouted is getting Gold Dragon-ed.  Which my dad says is also something you used to  be able to do in the Philippines when he was in the Navy,  but I don't know what that means.  It just would've been nice to score one goal  before the season's over.  Yeah, it would've been, Harley.  Uh, Dad, I can't believe I'm saying this,  but I don't want to get shutouted.  Really? What about Supreme Extreme Champions?  And the fact that we both hate this?  Yeah, well, the other girls want to keep playing,  and I guess it makes me kind of sort of  want to finish the game, too.  Those brave little idiots.  They are brave.  And extremely bad at soccer.  So how do we not get shutouted?  - I have no idea. - (whistle blows)  Second half starts in one minute.  No paper in there, by the way. Anymore.  Thirty seconds coaches.  - All right, Gold, uh, huddle up. - What do you got, Coach?  Oh, well, I-I feel like, uh, a lot of the time,  when a team is behind, the-the coach is supposed to give  a big speech about leaving it all on the court.  I mean, the-the grass court.  - What-what is this called? - ""Field,"" Coach.  Really? ""Field""?  - What are we, farmers? - I think it's ""field,"" Coach.  Right, right, field. Yeah, sorry. Just sounded weird.  - Anyway - (whistle blows)  Oh, wait! Louise, Mara, uh, come back.  I-I just had a-a coachy thought.  - Little late, huh? - Shh.  Mara, you're ready to get out of the goal, right?  Yeah.  Great, how about this: Mara's forward,  Louise, you be goalie.  And here's the thing, try and stop the ball  when it goes come go toward you, in the goal.  Oh, God, Dad, no.  It's just, I've seen you use your hands  at the restaurant, and goalies use their hands,  and you're good with your hands, so you can do it.  Yeah, you slap stuff and people.  I do slap stuff and people.  Okay, so let's do my plan.  (sighing): Okay, Coach.  Coach, I backed you up on that, but maybe in the future,  run stuff by me first, before you say it out loud?  Okay, Louise, now the ball probably won't  come to you right away,  but it could in this quarter, so  (whistle blows)  - Oh, no! - Oh, no.  Oh, yeah!  (gasps) The steamroller. Louise,  - I have another coachy thought! - Just shout it out!  Or you can discuss it with your assistant first.  Louise, the steamroller!  Oh, from the show!  Yes! It'll cut off her angle!  It's our only hope!  (shouts)  (distorted): What the ?  (grunts)  Ah, ha, ha!  I've got it!  (cheering) - Yeah! -Yeah!  Did Kayla not score?  Kayla, don't wipe that dirt off your face!  You keep that on to remind you of what you did!  What what do I do now?  It, uh throw it somewhere?  - Kick it! Drop-kick that son of a bitch! -(grunts)  Wow, that hurt my foot.  Where were you?  I play halfback.  I was halfway back.  Girls, don't throw grass like that.  You throw it like this!  Hey! (scoffs)  - Stop throwing grass. - You stop it.  You guys, get it together.  Uh, Gold Dragons?  - The ball? - The ball?  Yeah! You-you can, uh  you know. (whistles)  (gasps) Kick it?  Mm-hmm.  (grunts)  (indistinct chatter)  Guys, that's kind of distracting.  (whistle blows)  Goal.  -(cheering) - You did it! - Hell yeah!  Hell yeah, Walter!  We didn't get shutouted!  (laughing): Yeah!  Great job, girls!  I'm coaching!  I'm actually coaching!  Harley, I will fix your ponytail!  Mara, let me take a whack at those shoelaces!  Sami, you should live  with whichever parent makes you feel safe!  CHRISTY: Not bad, Coach.  That one moment when you were good at it.  It was a couple of really good moments, technically.  Yeah! Oh, uh, forget about that shoelace.  You're-you're gonna have to cut those off.  You got it, Coach.  (whoops) (Cuban accent): Fly, Pelican Brief, fly!  - (whistle blows) - Oh, right.  We have to keep playing.  You're a musical midget.  You're a doddering old diva.  This is the best day of my life.  I know, but I'm worried someone's gonna get killed.  These are very sharp criticisms.  Oh, okay, okay, wait, wait, hold on a second.  This is Gene and Linda's Piano Bar: Show Tunes and Mouth Foods.  And we like a little drama,  but we can't let two veterans of the stage fight  longer than you have already been fighting.  Ms. Merkin, did Sheila ever have a good show?  Sure. Thousands.  Literally. She's older than dirt.  -(grumbles) - And, Sheila, did Ms. Merkin ever  impress you with her impressive playing?  Mm, eh, Matilda's been good  since before she could button her own bloomers.  Wait, how long have you two known each other?  Forever. We're sisters.  -(gasps) What? - What? - Ooh, hot.  Oh, my God, you have to make up.  You're a showbiz family, like the Smuckers Brothers  or the Twisted Sisters.  Oh, Sheila, I'm sorry if I was late on a couple cues.  Maybe I was jealous that you were in the spotlight again.  Oh, Matilda, I'm lost without you backing me up.  I sing like an old barn cat when you're not there.  Hey, how about another number from the show?  ""If You See Something, Sing Something""?  - You know my key. - G-ish?  If your bags were out of your possession at any time   It could be bad, it could be fine   - Mom? - Yeah?  Weren't you making Teddy a burger?  Is it possible it's still on the grill, and it's on fire?  - Oh, my God, Teddy's burger! - Oh, God, oh, God.  BOB: Honestly, leaving you two alone,  I thought it would be way worse.  No, it's not a fire fire.  They're just putting out the smoke.  BOB: Uh-huh. Did you guys have fun?  - Oh, it was the best. - I'm a manager now.  And I'm a manager in training. Eh  - What? - Nothing. How was the game?  Great. We lost 21 to one.  Oh, that's good, honey.  - Is that good? - I don't know sports or math.  They gave their gosh darn all out there,  and we're gonna do it again next season.  - Oh, yeah, maybe not. - Oh, no.  But I can still assistant coach again, right?  Every damn day, Tina.  I frickin' love you, man.  Aw, you guys were having so much fun,  you don't even care that you're missing the Supreme marathon.  - Oh, my God! - (gasps) Go, go, go, go, go, go!  No, the fire department says we're not supposed  to go upstairs Oh, they're gone.  If your bags were out of your possession at any time   It could be bad, it could be fine   Don't leave it up to the canine unit   Security is fun and we're all doin' it   If you see something, sing something   Partner up and swing something   Let your voices ring if you see a-something strange   I see something suspicious   GENE: Uh-oh.  Oh, you know I wish I didn't   But it's better if I sing it   So everyone will know it's a thing   Like a shady guy, a weird suitcase, something"

I know a place. It's the cafeteria.  Or, do you want to sleep over at my house tonight?  Oh, sleepover?  Sleep over.  Uh, I  I guess I'm, uh  Hmm  - Did you just say yes? - Did I?  Yeah  S-Sure, yeah.  - Great. - G-Great!  Damn it.  LOUISE: You told Alex  you'd sleep over at his house?  Yes. No. Sort of.  Wow. That's a big step  from the last time you got invited to a sleepover,  and you asked if we could move away for just one night  - so you wouldn't have to go. - (groans)  I don't want to go, but I feel like I should.  I'm the only kid in my grade who hasn't done a sleepover.  Maybe it's time to try it.  Even if the thought of it gives me inside hives,  and a tummy full of (mumbles)  Gene, as someone who's been invited to many sleepovers  - One. - One.  I can tell you that there's nothing to be scared of.  - They're fun. - But what if I miss my bed?  And who's gonna give me good night kisses?  And what if his mom doesn't know the bedtime story  of Genie Wienie the Baby Beanie  who came out of mom's tummy and became a perfect boy?  - Listen. Here's what's gonna happen. - Mm-hmm?  TINA: You'll have dinner with Alex's family.  GENE: Mm-hmm.  TINA: If you're lucky, watch a movie, maybe even PG-13.  - GENE: Mm. - TINA: Then, at night,  you'll brush your teeth with weird toothpaste  - that you've never seen before. - GENE: Mmm.  TINA: And after his parents say good night,  that's when the real fun begins.  Flashlights come out, you gossip,  talk about boys, raid the fridge for a midnight snack  GENE: I do like midnight snacks.  LOUISE: And they love you.  TINA: And before you know it, it's morning.  I guess I can handle that. Do you think I can call mom  and keep her on the phone with me the whole time?  She'd probably do that.  LOUISE: She would totally do that.  GENE: Hmm. You think he'd let me invite Mom?  LOUISE: I think if you say her name three times,  she'll appear anywhere.  (yawns) You want more coffee, Teddy?  Sounds like you need some more coffee, Lin.  Yeah, it's true.  Bob kept waking me up last night with his snoring.  What? Me? Y-You're the one  who's always waking me up with your snoring.  Oh, please. You sound like someone's shoving a lawnmower  down a garbage disposal.  Oh, okay. Does this sound familiar?  ""Lin, wake up. You're snoring.""  - Because that's what I do every night. -(scoffs)  When I was married, Denise made me wear an anti-snoring thing.  It was like a big bite plate  that you put in your mouth when you sleep.  She also made me sit in the car by myself whenever we ate. Eh  - Hmm. - Bob, you should wear that bite plate thingy.  - You should. - How about this  We have a bet, and whoever snores the most has to wear it.  Fine. But how do we figure out who snores the most?  I can come over and watch you guys while you sleep.  - LINDA: No. No, thanks, Teddy. - No. No, that shouldn't happen.  - No? -No. - Yeah, no.  - Absolutely not. - We should, like, uh, record ourselves.  Oh, yeah, you could do that instead.  Hey! I can get you a recorder.  My next-door neighbor bootlegs concerts.  He has these tiny recorders that can record for hours.  Get ready to snooze and lose, Snory Spelling.  You get ready to lose, S-Snorma Ray.  Hi, kids. How was school?  - (moans) - Gene, what's the matter?  Gene got invited to sleep over at Alex Papasian's house.  And he said yes.  - Really? - What? Aw.  My little Genie Beanie is growing up.  Ah, all right, let's not make this weird, Mom.  Just give me one of your maxi-pads to lay my head on  when I fall asleep.  Let me give you a bunch of good night kisses now  so you won't miss them later. Come here.  - (kissing) - I already miss you, Mom.  Mwah, mwah, I miss you, too.  Mwah, yes, my baby.  - (kissing) My baby! - Wait, what  what'd you say about maxi-pads?  It helps him sleep. Leave him.  - GENE: Yeah. - When did that start?  Gene takes them in his backpack to school.  Yeah, I have a bunch.  Definitely needs to stop.  It all feels very healthy, very normal.  ALEX'S MOM: Gene, we're so happy to have you  - sleep over tonight. - (barking)  D-Donut! Donut! Hush!  Donut, God!  Oh, he's just excited.  That makes one of us.  Honey, can you take Donut? Please.  Come on, boy.  Come and be a dog with me.  (laughs)  - All right, well, I'm gonna - Yep.  - I'm gonna go. - Sure, sure.  Uh, I'll see you in a half hour when you come back  to check on me, right?  - You'll-you'll check on me Yeah. - Gene. Gene, Gene.  - Gene. It's okay. - Yeah? Yeah. Uh  - Look at me. You're gonna do great. - Mm-hmm.  - Uh-huh. - All right?  - Mm-hmm. Ah! - Open your eyes.  - All right, I'm gonna go. - (gasps)  - It's just a sleepover. - (moaning)  I'll see you Stop making that noise.  All right, I'll see you in the morning. -(yells)  Have fun, have fun. Bye.  Okay, boys, do you want to wash up?  It's almost time for dinner.  I'll be right there. I'm just gonna press my face  - up to the window and watch my dad drive away. - Okay.  GENE: Wow, he wasn't kidding. He's really leaving.  That son of a bitch is really leaving.  What, uh  - is this? - Ugh.  - It's a big plate of farts. - Alex.  It's steamed salmon, steamed spinach and steamed potatoes.  - Mmm, well, it sounds delicious to me. (chuckles) - Mm-hmm.  I'm not used to seeing the fish part of the fish.  Usually, it's hidden inside a stick.  Well, we used to eat fish sticks, too,  but we're trying something new.  - We're eating healthy. - (groaning)  What now, we eat healthy and happy.  - Ew! - We eat healthy and it makes us happy.  (retching)  - Alex! - Happy. Happy! Happy family!  (moaning)  Uh, I love it here!  BOB: Thanks for this, Teddy.  Yeah, my neighbor said it can record for up to six hours.  He also made me buy this CD of a Sting concert from 2003.  - Oh. Well, I'm gonna get going. - You want to sit down?  Have something to drink?  Sorry, I've, uh  Oh, yeah, no. You should go.  You have a family to get home to.  I'll stay here, listen to Sting  with the cheese and the crackers I put out  in anticipation of your visit. No big deal.  Um, I-I guess I could stay for another minute.  - All right, have a seat. - Yep.  You can have that seat, and I'll sit over here.  - Oh! That's uh - Right?  - That's a, that's a firm couch. - (stammers) Y-Yeah  Well, it doesn't get used a ton.  Want put a cushion down? Hold on.  There's a little cat fur on this pillow.  Who got a cat around here? Not me.  (groans) Where'd that cat fur come from?  Yeah. That's  - Uh -That's what happens when you get pillows off the street.  What, are you gonna throw out a perfectly good pillow?  - Yep. - (grunts)  - How's that? That better? - (sighs)  - Yeah, that's fine. That's good. - Is that good?  - Thank you. - Okay.  Uh, how was your day? At work.  Well, it wa it was a good day, and then it was this.  Uh Sting?  - It does. - Want to listen to Sting?  - Oh. All right, well, I'm definitely gonna go now. - Okay.  NARRATOR: Cacti grow in different shapes and sizes,  and they have developed many adaptations to conserve water.  Is this PG-13 by any chance?  If PG stands for ""Poop Garbage.""  Alex! Let's watch the documentary.  - Ugh. - Shh.  (sighs)    Okay, boys, good night.  Good night.  Sweet dreams. Kisses, huh?  M-Mwah, mwah, mwah.  You're not my Mom! Oh, my God, oh, my god,  sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  S-Sweet dreams.  (whispering): I hate this, I hate this, I hate this.  This is a living hell.  - What was that? - Ah, oh, you're awake?  (whispering): Yeah. I think my parents are in bed.  Yeah.  So, it's showtime.  I don't want to watch it.  No, no, my friend.  Put on your shoes and follow me.  I didn't know we were bringing backpacks to  Shh! (whispering): Use your whisper voice.  (whispering): Right. Sorry.  Okay, I did a dry run of this yesterday.  The last few steps are really creaky.  We're gonna have to climb over the bannister,  go down the other side, so we don't make noise.  Okay.  - Do as I do. - I will.  - Nice and easy. - Okay.  - Think of yourself as - We're Shaolin monks.  Yeah, I was gonna say J.Lo was, like,  dancing around the lasers.  Wait, is that the movie with Sean Connery,  - and they're robbers or something? - Yes, yes, yes.  - Gene, yes. - Okay, okay. Yeah, okay.  Good, good, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  - Okay. - No, thanks.  I'm more of a wet food guy.  Oh, no, these are for Donut. (clicking tongue)  It's so he doesn't bark and wake up my parents.  But I like how open-minded you are.  - Thank you. - All right, perfect.  Now let's go before he finishes.  But the fridge is over there.  Uh, what's going on?  - We're running away. - What?  - I mean, well, walking away. - We can walk away.  - No big deal. Let's walk. - You can't run away!  We were in the middle of my first sleepover.  I was told we were gonna gossip and talk about boys.  Alex! Oh, my God, you walk fast  for someone so horrible at running!  Alex, you can't run away.  Well, I can't live there anymore.  Why? Your parents seem okay-ish.  I mean, they shouldn't be allowed near food, but  I know! That I know. A month ago,  my parents watched a documentary about how sugar ""was evil.""  Next day, they threw out all the sugar in our house,  and put me on a diet.  Monsters! I mean, hmm  No, no, you had it right the first time. They are monsters.  And I'm done living with their dumb diet meals.  Well, I don't want to run away from your house.  I'm in my jammies.  My nighttime jammies.  If you don't want to run away, fine.  Go back, wake up my parents, and get me into trouble,  which would be snitching.  Uh puts kind of a bad spin on that.  Then come with me.  Like gym class, but for the rest of our lives.  Listen, I built a cabin in the woods.  It's stocked with food.  Real food.  A cabin in the woods?  - Didn't you see Cabin in the Woods? - No.  Me neither. But the music for the ads was terrifying!  Tina, Louise, it's late.  - You two need to go to bed. - Well, we can't.  We're helping you guys record yourselves sleeping,  just like every kid in every family does.  I'm in charge of tape. Anyone want some Scotch?  Actually, this is masking tape, but I really wanted to say that.  I thought all adults snored.  It's just the sound of them dying.  Maybe, you know, let nature take its course, right?  Aw, we're dying. All right.  Come on, you two. Off to bed.  Your dad and I have to fall asleep and snore at each other.  - Come on. - You guys have a beautiful marriage.  It has its moments.  What is this?  Some kind of animal trap?  No. (clears throat)  Welcome to my cabin.  I call it Alex's Alpine Oasis for Boys.  Hmm.  You know that thing where a place looks small  from the outside, but inside, it's enormous?  GENE: Mm-hmm.  That's what I want this to become.  How long were you planning on staying here?  Well, I think we have enough food for a month.  Maybe two, if we conserve these sugar packets.  - A month? Alex! - What?  (grunts) This is barely enough food  to get us through the next few minutes  while I stress-eat and convince you to go back home.  I'm not going home.  But yeah, let's stress-eat.  Mmm! Oh, oh, oh.  Hello, Shuggie.  Sweet, sweet Shuggie.  So, where are we supposed to sleep?  There are no beds in here.  Well, who needs beds when you have  these cool black sleeping bags?  Check them out.  Whoa-oh, coming at you.  These are for garbage.  Well, y but, yeah, but they're bags, right?  Look, look: here you go, here you go.  Slip into this little guy.  Uh, odor protection and drawstrings.  Nice and snug.  - Zip it up tight. (grunts) - (groans)  In a garbage bag in the middle of the woods.  My horoscope was right.  BOB: All right, you ready?  - LINDA: Ready. - Okay.  It's recording. (stiffly): Good night, Linda.  - Why are you talking like that? - I don't know.  I guess 'cause So it's clear for the recording.  - You sound weird. Just relax. - Okay, all right.  - Good night. - Still weird. That's not  Just let's just go to sleep.  (sighing): You're gonna lose.  What? Did you just say, ""You're you're gonna lose?""  - I didn't say anything. - Yes, you did.  We're recording ourselves. I can play it back for you.  I don't know what you're talking about.  - Snore loser. - What?  What? Nothing!  Night. You're dead.  Oh, my God.  (munches)  (whoops)  How many of those have you had?  I don't know, I stopped counting.  I hear my heartbeat. Do you hear my heartbeat?  Maybe we should conserve the rest of the food.  Yeah, good idea, good idea. Good idea.  Uh, I think I just felt a raindrop.  - Really? - Ah!  Did you mean to leave a gaping hole in the ceiling?  Uh, that's a skylight.  We're getting wet. (groans)  Okay, look, look, look.  Everybody just start thinking.  We can pull our garbage bags over our heads.  That'll keep us dry. Drawstrings, activate. Go!  Um, I don't think that's a great idea.  You know, because of breathing.  Oh, right. Yes, yes, yes.  See? This is why we're a great team.  I have sugar, and you you know about breathing.  Is it getting wetter in here?  Ah! Alex's Alpine Oasis for Boys has turned out exactly to be  as well-constructed as I thought it was!  Which is not well-constructed.  Are we done running away?  Can we go back to your house now?  I told you, I'm never going back there.  No, you're right.  We should stay here. This is perfect.  I forget, have I thanked you yet for inviting me over?  Oh, I know what we can do.  We'll hitchhike to the airport  and pretend we're ambassadors from Dubai.  And then they'll let us fly to Dubai.  Next thing you know, we're in Dubai, baby.  Okay, we could do that.  - Or, what if we went to my house? - No way.  Your parents will call my parents.  Bad plan. We're going with Dubai.  Listen, we won't tell my parents we're there.  We'll get my sisters to let us in.  - They'll know what to do. - Eh, I don't know.  Come on, at least we can get out of the rain.  Fine, but I feel like you're being really overcritical  of Alex's Alpine Oasis for Boys.  I mean, this could have been a place of learning.  (both snoring loudly)  (groans)  (grunting)  - (pebble taps glass) - (gasps)  Gene?  What are you guys doing down there?  Wait, is this a dream?  I wish. Now, don't tell Mom and Dad,  but Alex ran away from home, and I went with him,  and now we're standing here in the rain,  and Alex has had a lot of sugar.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep, yeah.  LOUISE: So,  the sleepover took a weird turn, huh?  - Yes. Yes. - No. No.  So, are you coming in, or  We can't go inside.  We can't let Mom and Dad know about this.  But they would love this.  They're so good at telling us  to change out of wet clothes.  Yeah, but they're gonna want to call Alex's parents,  and we're not doing that, for some reason.  - It's a pretty good reason. - It's not a good reason.  - It is a good reason. - It is not a good reason.  - It's a great reason, Gene. - I don't think it's  - a good reason, I've seen reason - It's a great reason!  - GENE: No. - I could listen to this forever,  but, uh, we'll get the keys to the restaurant  and be right back.  Great idea. Bring dry clothes for us.  Oh, and nothing fussy.  I hate buckles, buttons, and bows.  Maybe just a tapered jean,  or if you've got sweatpants, that'd be great.  (snoring)  Lin. Lin, wake up.  What? What happened? What happened?  You were snoring, and it woke me up, so I win.  Just because you woke up  doesn't mean you weren't snoring.  Maybe you woke yourself up, Snora the Explorer.  All right, well, let's listen to the recording,  uh, George Snoreman.  Okay, let's.  Ooh, maybe I confessed something fun in my sleep,  like I'm really a Russian agent, like, like Felicity.  BOB (on recording): Good night, Linda.  I told you that sounded weird.  Fast-forwarding.  - (loud snoring plays) - Oh, here we go.  Is that me? Which one's me?  Uh that one. Oh, oh, oh  - may-maybe that one. - (fart)  - Oh, that's you. - You.  - You. No, no, that's you. - No  - (loud fart) - Okay, that's me.  - Yeah, that was you. - Yep.  - (snoring and farting continue) - Hmm, toss-up.  Ugh, what is wrong with us?  LOUISE: Okay, we got you guys tucked away down here.  Out of sight, out of mind.  What happens now?  Uh I don't know.  (gasps) Peanut butter.  Oh, and the real kind, not that natural stuff  with four inches of oil on top.  (grunts) It's nice down here.  Gene, you know what we should do? We should live here.  I do live here. Aah!  - You are terrible at running away! - What?  And you shouldn't have run away in the first place.  Alex, sometimes you have to toughen up  and do stuff you don't want to do.  Like a no-sugar diet  or a sleepover at someone else's house.  And maybe, hopefully, those things will  make us stronger in some way.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  (sobbing)  Oh, my God, you're right. (sobbing)  Wow, I've never seen someone cry  and eat peanut butter at the same time.  It's a little hard to watch.  Okay, what do I do?  You could go home.  No. No, I can't. I'll get in trouble.  And then I'll get punished.  My parents let me have four ounces of ice cream a month.  They're gonna take that away from me. It's the one thing I have.  Okay, kooky idea What if you un-run away?  - What do you mean? - What if we sneak back into your house  before your parents wake up?  Then they'll never know you were gone.  It'll be like it never happened.  But the doors are locked.  My sister can pick locks.  I mean, I'm better at locks on Tina's room,  Tina's drawer, Tina's diary  - Wait, what? - But I can try a front door.  Ugh. But what about Donut?  I mean, he'll hear us and then bark  and wake up my parents.  I might have an idea for that.  Alex, we're sneaking back into your house,  going to sleep, and waking up  to a healthy, bland breakfast that probably involves muesli.  (sniffles) Okay.  Is Donut your brother? Just curious.  Okay, here's the plan. Tina's gonna distract Donut  - The dog. - Right. The dog.  And Louise will pick the lock,  and Alex and I will stand here and try not to panic.  Not panicking. Not panicking. I'm not panicking.  Good job. You're doing great.  - I am doing great. This is great. - Yeah.  - This is fun. This is a good idea. - Oh, my God.  I wonder what you'd be like if you were panicking.  (crazy laugh) That is funny.  Tina, get in position.  Ah, squishy.  Okay. Here goes nothing.  (chuffs)  - (barking) - Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.  He stopped barking.  Hope he finds my hand. Oh, wow. Yeah, he totally found my hand.  Are you sure this isn't your brother?  People. Hush. Please.  Little girl. Big lock. Need to concentrate.  - (snoring on recorder) - Is that you? That's definitely you.  - I can't I can't tell. - Yeah, it is hard to tell.  TINA (on recording): Quiet. Don't wake up Mom and Dad.  - Wait. Did you just hear Tina? - I don't know.  - I heard something. - LOUISE (on recording): No, no, no.  They're not gonna wake up.  They're in their angry rhino phase.  - TINA: Oh, yeah, of course. - Hmm.  (loud snoring over recorder)  Oh, that is you. Wow.  What do you think the kids were doing?  Don't change the subject.  You just started honking on a whole nother level.  - I'm winning this thing. - (loud snoring)  Oh, that's me.  - Ugh. We're both disgusting. - (beeps off)  So what now what do we do?  Is it a tie? Is the bet off?  No one wears the thing on the snoring thing?  - What do we do? - I'm fine with that if you are.  You know what? Yeah, works for me.  Can we just go back to sleep?  Yeah. I guess. Yeah.  (sighs loudly)  - I can't sleep. - Yeah, me neither.  - It's too quiet now. - Yeah, I know.  I think I'm not used to you not snoring  in the middle of the night.  Same here. I guess you're my white noise.  My disgusting white noise.  - I guess you're mine, too. - Aw.  I mean, maybe I woke up because you stopped snoring,  - not because you started. - Maybe. Should we turn it back on?  - Really? - Yeah. It's either that or pills.  - Okay. - (snoring over recorder)  (loud snoring over recorder)  (Linda and Bob snore loudly, along with recording)  - Mmm. - I'm running out of peanut butter.  Ugh. Can you hurry up?  It doesn't take this long to pick locks in the movies.  - Well, you try it, Houdini. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I got out of hand, and I'm sorry.  I told you it's possible  I might not even be able to open  (chuckles) I'm the best.  - That's it. - That a boy.  - Shh, shh, shh. - Good dog. -Good boy, Donut.  - (Donut whining) - Okay, we're in.  - We know. Now let's get upstairs before anyone hears us.  (grunting)  They have a fun way of going up stairs.  - What is that parkour? - Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.  Wait. There's someone in the kitchen.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear, darling, ice cream.  Are you kidding me?  - Should we join her? - What?  No, no. She can't know that we're not in bed.  Right, right, but every diet has room  for a little midnight kitchen sneakin'.  You should try it yourself sometime.  Huh. Yeah.  See? This is why we have sleepovers.  I'm never coming back here.  How long do I have to keep doing this?  You know what? Let's rub a bunch of peanut butter on the floor  - and just get out of here. - Okay. Bye, Donut.  I'll never forget you. Don't change.  - We did it. - Yeah. You know,  I think I'm crashing from all that sug ah  Oh, God. This is it.  This is the scary part.  (sighs) Think of happy things.  Mom smell, Dad smell, aioli, Rachael Ray, Luke Cage.  - (sighs) - (door opens)  - ALEX'S MOM: Good morning, boys! - It's morning?  - I fell asleep? - Oh.  Do you say that every morning? That's cute.  - How'd you boys sleep? - Like lambs.  Like little, sugarless lambs.  How about you, Mother?  Very well, thank you.  Breakfast is on the table.  Who likes muesli?   Ugh.  No one.   LINDA: Thanks for the recorder, Teddy.  Yeah, glad to help, or not help, I guess.  - No clear winner, huh? - Nope.  But definitely two clear losers.  Who? Oh, us.  Very funny, Louise.  They're back. Oh, they're back!  There's my little sleepover star.  How was it? Did you have fun?  It was bad, then really bad, then wet,  then suspenseful, and then it was over.  Like my second, fourth and fifth kisses.  Hmm. Uh-uh.  Well, you did it.  Now you never have to sleep outside the house again.  Not when you go to college, or when you graduate college,  - or even when you get married. - Yay! I love you, Mom.  I love you.  - Mwah - Mwah  Does anyone else feel like a third wheel?  Little bit.  - LINDA: I love you. - Let's throw stuff at them.  - LINDA: Forever. - Oh, yeah.  I don't wanna leave home   Because I hate sleepovers, sleepovers   I'm gonna go to bed alone   Because I hate sleepovers, sleepovers   Get me outta here, these sheets smell weird   Let's call my dad   And have him pick me up right now, thank you   I'm finished, I'm out, I'm done   Because I hate sleepovers, sleepovers   Okay, it was kinda fun   But I still hate sleepovers, sleepovers."
"1  Look what I found in Mom and Dad's interesting-smelling closet.  Wait, what were you doing in our closet?  Bup, bup, bup! A box of old tapes, which I believe  includes a tape of a certain song  someone sang to a certain poop  - when she was little. - (gasps) No! What?  I thought I destroyed that tape.  Your mom made a copy. She loved that song.  - Behold. - GENE: The legendary  Tina singing to her poop tape.  And after she sings to it, she flushes it and then cries.  Like a Viking funeral.  You know what? I think I might just go into the kitchen.  - Uh, anyone want any crackers? - Hey! Geez, Tina.  That's, like, the most athletic you've ever been.  No one can see this. I'm a mature young woman now  who just flushes her poop, and that's that.  So I'm gonna swallow this.  It's not working.  Tina, get the tape out of your mouth.  Fine, then I'm gonna go hide this.  - Not in my room. - I'm back.  - How was PTA? - P-T-Great.  After the meeting, I had a nice talk  with Ruthanne Donahue, Patrick's mom.  I think he's in your grade, Gene.  Patrick Donahue. Good at math,  has a weird laugh. That's all I know.  So, Ruthanne and I were talking,  and she said, ""We should do a double date sometime.""  And I said, ""Yeah."" And she said, ""How's tomorrow?""  And you said  - no? Lin. - Yes.  It happened so fast.  She pulled out her calendar and everything.  You were supposed to say, ""Let me get back to you""  and then never get back to her.  - So lie? - No, not lie.  Just say ""no"" but in a really indirect way.  Come on, Bob. We don't have any friends who are couples.  Think of how fun it would be  if we had best couple friends.  (all laugh)  (Bob and Linda laugh)  Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah   (Bob and Linda laugh)  Wait, you want to go on one of those train things?  - Yeah. Double date. - Can't we just tell them  - we got sick or something? - Lie again?  - Tina, please. - Maybe we'll have fun  and this date'll surprise you.  Like when you think a guy is gonna murder you  and then he proposes.  Come on, Bob. Please?  - Uh, fine, I'll go. - All right!  Whoa. What is this?  Oh! Oh, yeah. This is a zombie movie from the early '80s.  A bunch of people get trapped in a Jewish deli.  It's called Again with the Living Dead.  Zombies in a deli? I'll have some of that on rye.  - Am I right? - I forgot I had this.  It's so good. And scary.  But it's also funny. I mean, in a really messed up way.  - Huh. - Oh, but it's not for kids.  Y-You guys should never watch it.  Till you're maybe 20.  Sure. Sure. Sure, sure.  Tonight! One night only.  Again with the Living Dead.  The scariest movie about a Jewish deli  - you'll ever see. - Top ten, at least.  Our parents leave at 7:00.  Movie starts at 7:05. Who's in?  Me. I'll bring an extra inhaler.  I might watch through my hands, but just 'cause I like my hands.  I'm in. I like a little shiver in my liver.  - Right, Jay Ju? Get over - Ow! Zeke.  - Zeke, stop. - We want to come, too.  (screams) That's my scary movie sound.  A-ooga! That's my ""no, you didn't"" sound.  Oh, and this isn't a free show, people.  The entrance fee is candy. Plus tax,  which is candy. Okay, scat.  And don't tell Tina. She'll get all babysitter on us.  - Hmm. - Hey, T.  Hello.  Hey, what's going on?  We were just telling everyone how excited we are  to have you babysit for us tonight.  'Cause it's such a treat.  - Oh, thanks. I mean - Yeah.   babysitting is a lot of responsibility,  but at the ripe old age of 13,  I think I've learned a few tricks. Watch this.  (yawns) Who's getting sleepy?  (yawns) Me.  Oh, she's good.  LINDA: Okay, kids.  We're going on a double date with our new couple friends.  Double couple trouble.  Don't come on too strong, Mom. You don't want to give them  the full Linda on the first date.  I'll be cool.  Couple friends till the very end.   Ah! There, I got it out. I got it out.  - Oh, boy. - Bob, promise me  you'll try to have fun tonight.  Don't complain like you like to do.  W-What do you mean, ""like I like to do""?  You know, you make your little noises and your faces.  Dad has resting ""B"" face.  Okay, Lin, fine. I promise I won't complain  if you don't say ""this is fun"" over and over again.  Saying something's fun doesn't make it fun.  Fine. Come on.  Let's go. Bye, bye, bye. Mwah.  - Stay out of my room. - You got it.  All right, I'm gonna go into Mom's room.  Gene, check the VCR and make sure it's hooked up.  - On it. - What are you guys doing?  (sighs) Listen, I didn't want to say anything earlier  because I knew you'd be like  (imitating Tina): ""No, we can't invite people over  to watch that scary movie Dad told us not to watch.""  What? No, we can't invite people over  BOTH: to watch that scary movie Dad told us not to watch.  - Uh-huh. - You guys, I can't let this happen.  I'm the babysitter, damn it.  Tina, when Dad said, ""Don't watch the movie,""  what he really meant was, ""Watch the movie.""  I mean, he was practically winking.  I don't know.  (singsongy): Jimmy Jr. is already on his way over.  And he's gonna need someone to comfort him  - if he gets scared. - Huh.  Comfort Jimmy Jr. Okay, I'll allow it.  I mean, zombies are more sexy than scary, right?  I think everyone would agree with that.  (classical music playing)  Where are they?  They must not be here.  Uh, let's go home.  Stop being a negative noodle.  You just need to get used to the fact  that we're gonna have a good time.  BOB: Oh, God. There are people sitting  with a dog. Please don't let that be them.  Linda! Over here!  Oh, my God. It is.  Oh, hi, Ruthanne.  Bob, Linda, this is Nicholas.  - Hi. - Hi.  RUTHANNE: And this is Lars.  You brought your dog to a restaurant.  Lars is my emotional support dog.  Yep. We bring him everywhere we go.  Everywhere. All the time. It's fine.  So, uh, should we get another chair?  No, no, no, no. Lars, scoot.  Sit here, Linda.  Aw, thanks for the seat, Lars.  - (Lars whines) - Aw, he got scared.  Oh, don't pet his ears like that. He hates that.  -(Lars snarls) - Oh, my God! Oh, no! -Ooh!  Oh! Oh, oh, I'm stuck.  - I'm stuck. - Oh, God. Geez.  - Let me let me help you. - So sorry about that.  - It's okay. - I was talking to Lars.  Oh. Uh, well, this is fun.  - I-I mean, uh, double date. Yay. - Yep.  I'm so glad we decided to share everything.  I hate when people order their own meals.  It's like, ""Oh, you want to order what you like  and eat it all?"" Selfish, right?  Are there any more shrimps? I didn't get any.  Remember we said we were gonna order two,  and then Ruthanne said we were just gonna order one?  I You know, just one. We just need one.  Yeah.  There's tons of the tomato salad  that Ruthanne was very excited about at one point.  I need something over here. I'm starving.  So, uh, Nicholas, Lars gives you emotional support?  Yes, that's right. He-he does.  What's your emotional thing?  I mean, if you don't mind me asking?  My therapist says I have PTSD.  My other therapist says I don't.  But my psychic says I definitely do,  so that's two to one.  - Oh, were you - I'm working through some trauma  from when I was in an a cappella group in college.  And  And it was a cappella.  There wasn't any music. Ever.  - People hated us. - Huh.  And now we have Lars. And that's okay.  So, uh, what do you guys like to do for fun?  - Tennis, anyone? Ha! - I can't play sports.  - I have inverted arms. - Oh.  We do like to do escape rooms. Have you ever done one of those?  What's an escape room?  You go to a place where you get locked in a room  that looks like a war bunker or a-a dungeon,  and you have to figure out how to escape.  - Oh, that sounds, uh - It is.  Uh, Nicholas, you like going to escape rooms  after what you've been through with the a cappella thing?  You're not really locked inside, Bob.  (snorts) Grow up, buddy. Come on.  - Uh, okay. - (laughs) It's just fun.  - It's just a joke. Ooh! - We should all go sometime.  - Uh Oh! - Eh  Uh, Lars is, uh, sniffing my crotch.  - Uh, like, a lot. - (sniffing)  - Oh, yeah, he is. - Yeah.  I-I want to push him away,  but I'm afraid he's gonna bite me.  Yeah, that's the that's the thing.  Um, so Ooh!  Can you, um, get him to stop?  - (sighs) Lars. Lars. Lars? - (sniffing continues)  Lars. Lars!  Lars! Lars!  That's okay. Forget it.  All right, people.  Handy over the candy.  - Gene? - Welcome to the Belcherplex.  Please silence your phones and your butts.  (screams) I mean, ah, the Good.  - The lights are out. - Jimmy Jr., if you get scared,  - I'm here for you. - Uh, you're kind of close, Tina.  - Can you move over? - I'm right here if you need me.  Uh, you're still really close.  Shh. Don't talk during the movie.  MAN: Can I take your plates?  Oh, I'm still working on mine.  Ruthanne is the slowest eater I know. (laughs)  Lars is, uh, the slowest eater, too.  - He's still in there. - Oh, wow, he is.  And done.  I-I think we're ready for the check.  Yes.  The gentleman and lady already paid for your meal.  - What? - You did?  Yeah. We gave him our credit card when we got here.  Don't worry about it. You guys can get the next one.  - Yeah. Yeah, you know. - Yeah. Yeah, we'll work things out.  - We'll schedule something. - Um, whenever.  Or how about this?  You guys can get dessert right now.  Ooh, yes! Should we go get some gelato?  - Uh - Ooh, oh, my.  (chanting): Gelato. Gelato.  Hey, he's out.  My pants are really wet.  Girls in one car, boys in the other.  - Linda, I'll drive us. - Uh  We're with you, Bob. Lars calls shotgun.  He gets carsick.  - Bobby. Bobby. - Lin.  Lin.  ZEKE: This isn't so scary.  - (zombie moans) - (all gasp)  Nope, I was wrong. It's scary.  WOMAN (on TV): Hey, Mr. Goldberg.  You want your usual?  - (zombie moans) - You look different.  - Did you, uh, get a new haircut? - (zombie moans)  (all scream)  This movie's ruining roast beef sandwiches for me.  Smells like old fries in here.  Uh, it's probably the old fries.  I can't find the button for the window.  I just want a little air.  Oh, it's a hand crank. Sorry.  Oh. Uh, okay.  Let's see if I can deal with this.  -(Lars gagging) - Uh, w-what's wrong with your dog?  Oh, he's probably just gonna throw up.  Oh, God. Should we pull over?  Oop! He's fine. He swallowed it.  He's a trooper. Good boy, Lars.  It's not that I hate Lars. It's just,  why can't I be my husband's emotional support dog, you know?  - Uh-huh. - Ooh!  There's an escape room place.  A what? Oh, oh, yeah.  Crazy idea: should we skip dessert  and do an escape room instead?  Oh, I don't think we should.  You want to let the boys know the new plan?  LINDA: Okay, we're doing this.  I'll text Bob.  ""Going to escape room.  No gelato."" Send.  Oops, ""gelato"" auto-typed to ""genital.""  Oops, did it again.  (phone buzzes)  Can you check that? It might be from Linda.  I've never gotten a text from anybody else.  It says we're going to an escape room.  She signed it ""genitals genitals.""  Is that, like, a nickname for her or  Wait, we're going to an escape room?  - I know. Great, right? - (Lars sniffing)  I didn't even know they had one around here.  Uh-oh. Oh, God.  - He found the old fries. - Sorry.  NICHOLAS: It's not even his cheat day.  - (zombie moans) - (woman screams)  (screams) I don't even want to see it or hear it,  but I don't want to stop watching.  Oh, matzo brain soup.  - (zombie moans) - (screams)  - I got you, Jay Ju. - I got you, Jimmy Jr.  Okay, Zeke. Little bit of an eager beaver.  Maybe I'll just squeeze in here.  Maybe not.  MAN: Welcome, everyone  and dog, to the ""jail break"" escape room.  Wow, it's so dirty in here! Really authentic.  The lobby was dirty, too. Is that on purpose?  (chuckles): Whoa-hoa. You guys are comin' in hot.  Let's just take a step back and realize I'm by myself today,  and you guys are the last room of the night.  - Oh, he's in character. - I am not.  Once I close this door, you'll have one hour  to find the key and escape.  All the clues you need are hidden in this room.  I bet I know where the key is.  It's in that locker right there.  No, it's too obvious, Ruthanne.  I'm not allowed to say, but it's not obvious.  It's a pretty good spot.  I'll be right outside that door.  If you absolutely need to leave the escape room  before the hour is up, that's a panic button right over there.  If you press it, I'll come and then I'll let you out.  Can we press it now? Just kidding. Kinda.  And I'm gonna collect your phones  so you won't take any pictures.  We also don't want you to use them  to, uh, post bad reviews online.  Not that we've ever gotten lots of those.  Wait, wait, wait. Before we get started,  can Lars and I run to the boys' room?  Yeah, I want to go to the ladies' room.  I'll show you where it is.  Lin, this is an awful date.  I know you told me not to complain, and I'm not  - That's just a fact. - I know. I'm not gonna say  this is fun, because it's not fun, at all.  (sighs) Let's just do this escape room as fast as we can,  - so we can go home. - I should text Tina real quick  before that guy takes our phones away.  Doing an escape room, then coming home.  Double date awful. Nightmare couple. Kill me.  Sad face, sad face, sad face, turd. Send.  Okay, if everyone could surrender your phones, please.  - (phone vibrating) - Oh, wait, I just got a text.  Oh, it's from you, Linda.  Oh, God! Don't read that. Uh, Ruthanne  It says, ""Double date awful. Nightmare couple. Kill me.""  Sad face, sad face, sad face.  Turd. - Oh, boy. -Ooh.  Anyway, I'll take that.  Okay, everybody, happy escaping.  Okay, okay. I accidentally sent you a text that said  you were a nightmare couple, but it was a joke.  (chuckles): It was just a joke.  Lars, I need you more than ever right now.  Look, this is extremely awkward.  Let's just push the panic button and get out of here.  Sure. Push the panic button.  Get away from the ""nightmare couple.""  No, we don't want to get away from you.  Yes, we do.  No, no, we want to do the escape room with you.  - That'll make me feel better. - All right, fine.  Ruthanne said the key was probably in that locker.  Okay.  It's a combination lock. It's locked.  Yeah, it's a real sad-face nightmare locker.  - Turd. - Ignoring Ruthanne and Nicholas.  Look. A letter.  ""Dear Prisoner,  The Code is my name. Sincerely, Your PAL.""  - Huh. - The word ""PAL"" is capitalized.  Maybe it's a clue Maybe the code  for the lock combination is P-A-L.  - Ruthanne, right? - Mm, mm, mm.  - Nicholas? - Mm, mm, mm.  Lars? Why am I asking a dog? Wait, there's more.  ""A + B=14.""  - There's math? - Yeah.  So the letter ""A"" is in the word ""PAL.""  - Right. - And ""A"" and ""B"" are numbers  that add up to 14, right?  - Right. - So  - Four. - Wh-Why are you saying ""four""?  - I don't know. - Okay, 14 is  - Four. - Stop saying ""four""!  I'm sorry! I'm sorry!  That was amazing.  Everyone have a good time?  At our little movie screening? Anyone?  (squeakily): Can't talk.  Too scared.  I'll never not be scared.  I'm burning through canisters here. (inhales loudly)  - Are you guys really scared? - Mama.  I'm not gonna close my eyes again, I'll tell you that.  Wait. Let me try.  Bad idea! Oh, no, no! Bad idea!  - Zeke, open your eyes! - Okay, okay, okay!  - Guys, it's just a movie. - A great movie.  I mean, it's gonna stay with us,  probably for the rest of our lives, but  People, zombies aren't real.  Then how'd they get the idea for that movie?  Can I use your phone I'm calling my mom to come get me.  No. No parents. You're not supposed to be here.  And you definitely weren't supposed to be watching  a scary movie under my supervision.  Hey, we talked about this, remember?  You were never here,  you didn't watch a scary movie at our house,  and you're gonna leave here on your own two feet  in the next few minutes before our mom and dad come home.  I'm only stepping out of this house  if there's a long line of grown-ups going all the way  to my house and they're all willing to hug me.  Louise, no one's leaving. We've got a problem.  - (whispers): Yeah, you do. - Me?  You're the one who invited everyone over.  But you're the babysitter. I'm nine. What do I know?  (sighs) Let me try something.  Hey, guys, let's pretend we're on a treasure hunt  and the treasure's at your house.  Ready? Go!  Huh. Weird. That didn't work.  BOB: Okay, so we found the letter.  - Right. - And we found the Bible  under the mattress with another math problem in it.  It's like the friggin' SATs in here.  Oh, we're so bad at this.  (sarcastically): Oh, no, you're so good at this.  - Okay, Ruthanne. - Oh, what is that smell?  I think it was Lars.  He had those fries from your weird old car, remember?  Ugh. Did it just get worse?  That time it was me. Sorry not sorry.  Oh, two can play at that game, Missy.  - You wouldn't dare. - Escape this.  Oh, my God.  TINA: Okay.  We brought in every lamp from the house,  so it's nice and bright in here,  and we've got The Equestranuats on.  That's a happy show.  You're gonna forget all about that silly zombie deli.  Aah! Zombie pastrami!  Darryl, we went over this.  The zombie grandma didn't feel anything  when her face went through the meat slicer.  (groaning)  She doesn't feel pain because she's not alive.  - Not-not helping. - Tina, no one's budging.  I know. I-I need to find something  that will make them forget what they've seen.  What's the exact opposite of an R-rated zombie movie?  - (gasps) I'll be right back. - Well, she's dead.  BOB: Ugh! I'm getting close to passing out.  I think I have to push the panic button.  Yeah, the vent's not working.  (gasps) Wait. Bob, the vent!  Maybe there's a clue inside. (gasps) It opens!  - (squeaking) - Aah! Aah! Aah!  - Oh, my God! Oh, my God. - (Ruthanne and Nicholas scream)  - Aah! Aah! - Okay, hit the panic button!  - Oh, my God! Aah! - Hit the panic button!  -(barking) - Hello? Hello? Where's the guy?!  BOB: Let us out! We're panicking! We're panicking!  LINDA: Is this how escape rooms are supposed to work?  Trapped in a room with a crazy rat?  Nicholas, why is the rat chasing your dog?  (Lars whining)  Shouldn't it be the other way around?  He's an emotional support dog. He's very sensitive.  Ooh, this is a cappella all over again.  (beat-boxing)  Oh, Mickey, you're so fine   You're so fine you blow my mind, hey, Mickey!   - Nicholas, stop doing a Capella! - (beat-boxing)  I can't help it! I'm having a flashback!  - Ruthanne, Nicholas - (barking)  I'm-I'm sorry I sent you that mean text.  I don't want to die knowing that I hurt your feelings.  Look, we really need to get out of here.  Can you please help us?  - Yes! - Yes!  Bob, stick your hand down the toilet.  - Excuse me? - It's not a real toilet.  - Just do what I say! - Okay, okay.  - (squeaking, Bob shrieks) - The rat just grazed my foot.  I found something! It's a UV flashlight!  Shine it at the walls and ceiling.  LINDA: Look! There's secret writing on the ceiling.  It says ""B equals 8.""  (gasps) ""A"" plus ""B"" equals 14!  That means ""A"" equals 6!  So the second number on the combination lock must be 6!  Oh, my God, we're crackin' the code!  I feel just like A Beautiful Mind.  (insects trilling)  Wait. Is that the tape?  (gasps) I think it is.  Talk about jumping on a grenade.  Everyone, I found something that might help.  But before I play this, let me say, I was four,  and I was going through a phase that I grew out of mostly.  - Jimmy Jr., close your eyes. - Okay.  LINDA (on TV): You ready to flush the poopy, sweetie?  Let me sing my song.  (to ""Twinkle, Twinkle): Poo, poo, poo, poo   -  I love you  - (Linda laughs)  Poo, poo, poo, poo, I'll miss you.   - Uh, what's happening? - TINA: Oh, and cover your ears.  LINDA: Okay, say ""Bye."" We're gonna flush now.  - Bye, poopy. - (toilet flushing)  (crying): Hope you're okay.  LINDA: Aw, my teeny Tina and her giant poop.  - Uh-oh. Second flush. - (toilet flushing)  It's better than I remembered.  - Yikes. - Yup. Yup.  Well, I loved it, but I wish  they didn't kill off my favorite character.  So, how's everyone feeling?  I personally am feeling mortified.  I feel better. (laughs)  That taught me how to laugh again.  And how to love.  Okay, so, bye. Get out.  Geez, now I know how that poop felt.  Yeah, at least sing us a song, Tina. Come on!  Out! Out! Out!  - (barking, squeaking) - Okay. Ruthanne figured out  the math problem in the bible, so now we know  that ""P"" equals two and ""A"" equals six.  So we just need to figure out what the letter ""L"" equals.  - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Aah! Aah!  - (barking) - Hey, someone wrote the words  ""life in prison"" on the calendar.  Ooh, that's a clue. What date is the letter ""L"" on?  The fifth. Oh! The last number on the lock must be 5!  (whoops) Let's unlock the door!  -(barking) - (Ruthanne screams) -I'll unlock it.  - Really, Nicholas? - Yes. I can do this.  - Go, Nicholas. - Go, Nicholas. Go!  - Go! - Gee. Nope, can't do it.  BOB and LINDA: Damn it!  Nicholas, you can. You can. I know you can.  Look, I'll distract the animals somehow so you can make it, Nicholas.  I'll help you, Bob. I'll take Lars, you take the rat.  - Wait. What?! - Uh. (whoops)  - Lars, run to me. Come on. - (barking)  - Oh, they're both coming to me. - Go, Nicholas!  (whimpering) I can't remember the numbers!  I can't remember any numbers!  Oh, my God, Nicholas, it's 265. No pressure!  Right, right, right, right, right, right.  I unlocked it, and there's a key!  - Yes! Open it! Open it! - Open it! Open it!  - Open it, honey! - I opened it!  - (barking) - (Nicholas grunts)  - Come on, Lars. - (barking)  - We escaped! - (Ruthanne whoops)  - Ha! Ha! - We're free, buddy!  (snorts) Oh, hey, you guys escaped.  - Were you asleep? - Uh, I might have dozed off.  - There's a rat in there! - Oh, shoot.  Uh, the rat was a clue.  - Oh, I don't think so. - All right, fine.  I'll, uh, I'll give you the rat-in-the-room discount.  We'll take it. Bob and Linda, pay the man.  Here's three credit cards. Spread it around.  And your place smells like farts.  Hey, what are you kids still doing up?  (gasps) Aw, Tina's poop song!  Yeah, I'm gonna hit it with a hammer pretty soon.  - How was your double date? - It was fun.  It was?! You had fun?  I mean, it was awful, but I feel kind of brave and smart?  - Me, too! - Eh, that won't last.  - Yeah, you're right. - Yeah, yeah, it's already gone.  Why are there so many lamps in here?  We were playing lamps and we won.  Uh, okay. Well, time for bed.  Mom, Dad, can I sleep in your room tonight?  - Sure, honey. Is everything okay? - Oh, yeah. I'm fine.  I'm just gonna need to sleep with a kitchen knife.  Is that gonna be a problem?  Did you guys watch something scary?  - No. - Uh-uh.  But maybe I'll sleep in your bed, too,  you know, just to keep the knife company.  Wait. I want in on that action.  Yay! My little bedbugs!  BOB and LINDA:  Best couple friends   We're gonna be best couple friends   All four of us are gonna be friends till the end   Best couple friends   We're gonna be best couple friends   We go great together   Like tonics and gins   LINDA:  And we'll be singing   LINDA and BOB:  Someone's on a double couple date   Someone's having fun   Someone's on an old-time train thingy   LINDA:  'Cause we rented one   BOB: Really?  LINDA and BOB:  Best couple friends, we're gonna be   Best couple friends, all four of us"

Hey, nicknames don't last forever.  But be careful: the more you fight it, the more it sticks.  I knew a kid who had to change schools 'cause of a nickname.  - They called him ""Bobby Belchbottoms."" - Aw.  - LOUISE: Who was that kid, Dad? - No one you know.  This isn't about some random kid from your past, Dad.  This is about me,  and how Outdoor Ed is gonna fix everything.  So say good-bye to Fluffy-Butt, 'cause it's the last time  anyone's gonna hear it.  Fluffy-Butt, Fluffy-Butt   Oh, Fluffy, Fluffy-Butt   Fluffy-Butt.   RANGER CARL: If you get bit by a tick,  let Mr. Tweezers know.  If you get a splinter, also a job for Mr. Tweezers.  Oh, and, uh, another topic, totally unrelated to safety:  there may or may not be someone living in the woods nearby.  The so-called ""Windygap Hermit,"" he's not dangerous  Or, maybe he is, we really don't know.  I mean, there have been some missing hatchets  and some other things, but they could be anywhere.  So if anyone notices anything suspicious,  - please tell - ZEKE: Mr. Tweezers?  Uh, no.

Or Mr. Tweezers, yeah.  - I'll probably tell Tweezers. - I get it.  Now, we're gonna do things a little differently this week,  because they're predicting rain for the next few days.  There's gonna be a lot more indoor ed  - here at the Outdoor Ed Center. - JOCELYN: Wait, what?  - ZEKE: Come on. - Yes?  But we're still gonna team-build on the ropes course, right?  No, the ropes course isn't safe in the rain. Yes?  But we're still gonna hike to the top of Mount Windygap,  for our nature-iphanies, right?  No, the last quarter mile of that trail is in a steep notch.  It's like the mountain's rain gutter.  Totally impassable in bad weather. Really?  But what if the rain stops before Friday?  - Well, it's not supposed to. - But what if it does?  - Well, I don't think it will. - But what if it does?  Well, there's no sense discussing that,  because it's not gonna happen.  - Damn it. - (whispers): Sorry, T.  At least we still get a few days of blowing off school.  For those of you who think  you're just gonna blow off school  while we're up here, forget it.  You'll have your regular classwork, plus nature stuff.  - Oh, man. - Son of a bitch.  TEDDY: Wow. Three big nights alone. So what's the plan?  Well, we haven't made any plans.  Wait, aren't you excited to have couple time together?  - Of course we are. - Um, yes.  Oh, then let's brainstorm.  There's, uh, stand-up comedy classes.  - Ah. - Uh  - There's couples hot therapy. - Ooh. -Mm.  There's watching hockey with a friend. Huh?  - Hmm - All those things sound great.  Ooh! We're gonna go crazy.  (both snoring)  (yawns)  - Lin. - What? What? What?  We fell asleep on the couch.  What? Did we do anything fun?  I mean, we ate a lot of cheese.  Ugh, carry me to bed.  Ugh, carry me to bed.  TINA: I don't remember kids being all cooped up in the video.  We're supposed to be out there.  Up to our asses in nature.  Whoa, Tina, nature's all around you, girl.  This napkin came from a tree.  Yeah, and this syrup tree.  Sausage tree.  - Hey, Fluffy-B, pass the salt. - Ugh! That's it.  I need some space.  How about that salt? Little help?  I don't think you're supposed to be out here.  Well, I didn't come all this way to not go  on a life-changing nature hike.  - Who's coming with me? - Ugh, fine.  We'll go with you on your life-changing hike.  Just make it quick.  Hey, let's go off-trail to find some fox scat.  A scat-Enger hunt.  Is it everything you hoped it'd be?  (sighs)  We can go back now, if you want.  Already walking.  Huh, where's that darn trail?  Whoa. What the hell is this place?  Can't even see all this from just back there.  It's literally off the beaten path.  Do you think someone's here?  We should ask that lady holding an axe!  - Hi. - (screaming)  (moaning)  Wait, you're scared?  I'm the one who should be scared.  You're barging in without knocking. Rude.  Right, but you're the one with the axe. So  This? (laughing) Oh  I was just playing darts.  Whoa.  Live out here as long as I have,  and you get tossy with the hatchet.  Wait, you live here?  Are the hermit Ranger Carl told us about?  The Windygap Hermit?  ""Hermit""? Really? That's what society is calling me?  Not the Wonder Woman of the Woods?  No, just ""hermit.""  I hate labels.  (inhales, exhales)  Labels.  All better.  What was that totally normal thing you just did?  A cleansing ritual I made up.  - Does it work? - Don't I look cleansed?  - Eh. - Yes? - Uh  So what's a girl got to do  to get a turn throwing that thing?  You want me to teach you how to throw a hatchet?  Um, does a hermit scat in the woods?  There they are. Party animals.  So what'd you do? Where'd you go?  - We, um - Oh, we ate a bunch of cheese  and fell asleep on the couch.  What? You fell asleep on the couch?  This time is a gift.  It's a chance to reconnect with one another.  Why do I have to explain this to you?  Okay, Teddy, calm down.  We were tired.  We'll make up for it tonight.  Damn right you will. And when I come in here tomorrow,  I better be dazzled by your date tonight.  Dazzled! (panting)  What burger today, Bobby?  ""Paprika,"" that sounds pretty good.  So how long have you lived here, um, Hermit Lady?  My name's Martha Uh, well, it used to be.  The wind spoke through the trees, and I was born anew as  (whooshing)  Cool if we just call you ""Martha""?  - Sure. - Thanks. We don't speak wind.  What do you kids go by?  That's Louise, he's Gene and I'm Tina.  But I'm hoping to get a nature name of my own.  - Teagle. - That's up to nature, now, isn't it?  First, you got to level up.  ""Level up""? What's that?  ""Level up""? It's level up.  Level up!  Oh, like, level up.  Yeah, you got it. Level up.  I was supposed to level up, when-when we did  the hike to the top of Mount Windygap.  - Now that's not gonna happen. - Why not?  'Cause we're not allowed to do the team-building ropes course  in the rain, or hike the mountain in the rain.  It's a real ""blame it on the rain"" situation.  Team building?  You really think other people are gonna  help you get what you want in life?  It looked really good in the video.  Take it from a hermit teams are dumb.  - Feels like it's almost lunch. - Oh, we better go.  If we don't show up for the next meal, they're gonna look for us.  Uh, I hate to be that lady you met in the woods  who's like, ""Hey, kids, don't tell anyone about this,""  but, uh, can you not tell anyone about this?  About me?  You got it, fun stranger.  Where are you kids coming from?  We just stepped out for a smoke.  Well, I guess in all this rain, you can't burn down the forest.  Hey, but also, don't smoke. (chuckles)  You know, I can't tell if you're joking.  Well, let's get inside.  It's time to learn our famous weasel song.  I can't tell if you're joking.  Well, I've got the weasel.  You can pretty much see that I'm not joking.  And then you guys sing  Who's that   Knocking on my hole?   And then you all sing Weasel, weasel   If you please'll   And then this group goes,  -  Eeh, eeh  - Where were you, Tina?  Oh, just off, trying to level up.  ""Level up""? What's that?  What's F-Butt fluffering about?  You know what, Tammy?  Wait, no, I know what to do.  (exhales)  Labels.  Wow, that did feel good.  Whoa, did you just call me ""Labels""?  - No, I was - It's not nice to call people names.  Huh? No, no, that's what you guys have been doing to me.  - I was just - Not cool, Fluffy-Butt-Label-Face.  Not cool.  LINDA:  I'm putting on my shoes   My really good shoes   My date night shoes   And my date night earrings.   So, what sounds good, Lin?  Dinner and a movie?  Dinner and two movies.  All I know is, we're gonna go nuts.  Let's get this party start  (both snoring)  - Oh, no, oh, no. No. - What? Wait, what? What happened?  We fell asleep on the couch again.  Maybe we're too old to have fun.  I'm not old, you're old.  Going back to sleep.  Rub my bunions.  First stop when we get home (grunts)  - (hatchet thunks) -  hatchet store.  And then, I did the cleansing ritual  and felt better for, like, a second.  But then, they started all over again. (groans)  Why do you care so much what these other kids think?  Because I don't know, I-I just do.  It's because you're living your life for other people.  I am? Huh. Maybe I am.  I used to be just like you.  I thought I had it all.  The one bedroom apartment, the Nissan Altima lease,  the job at a brand management company in an office park.  But ever since I was like ""see ya"" to society,  I don't care what anyone thinks of me.  Wow, and I thought Outdoor Ed was gonna open my eyes.  But it turns out, it took a weird lady hermit.  And her three amazing hatchets:  Buddy Hatchet, Teri Hatchet and Orrin Hatchet.  Still, it would've been great  to get to the top of Mount Windygap.  Yep, old Mount Windygap, so gappy, so windy.  Oh, my God, you've been to the top of Mount Windygap?  - Mm-hmm. - By yourself?  Yeah, uh, yep. Mm-hmm.  Huh. I thought the only way  to get to the top was with teamwork.  I think you're my hero.  - I want a poster of you. - (grunts)  And how has this not replaced golf?  LINDA: Don't even think about that couch, mister.  I'm not. Much.  What's taking you so long?  I wanted to change my look a little,  get in the mood to go out.  Can't stay home looking like this, huh?  Ha, ha!  I'm Miami Beach bronze, baby.  You used a tanning spray?  I'm a hottie in another body.  Mm. Does that body have jaundice?  Yeah, well, now, you have jaundice.  - Ha. - Ow! Hey, stop.  - (laughs) - Oh, man ugh.  It isn't coming off.  Well, there's only one thing to do now.  Lin, there's a reason I never wear these old clothes.  Okay, that white sport coat might make me look incredible.  And it does. You look good, too.  Actually, I don't know how you look,  'cause I can't take my eyes off me.  Oh, yeah.   Just an FYI, Tammy.  I don't care what other people think about me anymore,  - so, yeah, good night. - Really?  - Yep. - So you don't care if we call you ""Flufficus-Butticus""?  Which is, of course, the Latin name for your species.  Nope. Not at all.  What about ""Fluff With a Side of Butt""?  Nope.  BOB: Oh, my God.  Wh-Why do we have to go dancing here?  There has to be a place that's, like,  - more from the present. - What'll it be, chief?  Oh. Chief. I like chief.  Yeah, you do. What are you drinkin'?  Um, I-I don't know. What should I get?  Two Long Island Iced Teas.  Whoo-hoo! Whoo! (rhythmic grunting)  - Nice moves, Bobby! - This one's called  another round of Long Island Iced Teas!  LINDA: Ha-ha-ha!  (cackling laughter)  Oh, we never want this night to end!  - Oh, it ended. - That's it, people. We're closed.  - Hey, our kids are out of town. - Party at our place!  (whooping)  I'll bring me!  (both snoring loudly)  (Linda snorting)  Lin. Lin.  - Wha-Wha-Wha? - (groans) Did we bring people back here?  Yeah, I think we did.  Are we really cool now?  I think we are.  Oh, no.  - No, no, no! - Oh, God!  Linda! Why did you bring people back here?  I'm never gonna stop caring what people think about me  if I'm too afraid to level up.  I got to get to the top of Mount Windygap.  Martha did it alone, so I can, too.  P.S. I had another dream where Jimmy Jr. and Zeke  switched heads What's up with that?  There's a bear over there   With a ribbon in her hair, and she says   (deep voice):  ""Howdy do!""   - Know what time it is? - Hatchet o'clock.  Yep. Where's Tina?  She's not here.  Did she go see Martha without us?  This is why we need to put a GPS chip in that gal!  Or what if we read her journal?  Blah, blah, blah.  Teen stuff. Hormones.  (gasps) Tina's going to the top of Mount Windygap by herself?  - Aah! - And she's having that dream again.  The one where Jimmy Jr. And Zeke switch heads?  - Yeah. - What's up with that?  Come on, Teagle, you can do this. No, I can't.  That's Tina speaking. Don't listen to her, Teagle.  Martha? Martha!  -(in distance): Way to go. Level up. - Shh, shh. Wait.  Do you hear that? It's coming from in there.  AUTOMATED VOICE: Way to go. Level up.  (screams) What the ?  LOUISE: What is all this stuff?  Is that a towel warmer?  (gasps) You're no hermit!  You're not even a camper! You're a glamper. Ugh.  - Way to go. Level up. - ""Level up"" is from a video game?  - (sighs): Yeah. - Letting Go  Cleansing Rituals for Divorced Men.  (gasps) I suppose you didn't even think  of that slightly underwhelming cleansing ritual yourself!  It came from this disc of sadness!  Where'd you get all this stuff?  Mostly from the ranger's cabin.  We believed you. We believed that you were  the Wonder Woman of the Woods.  I know. I got excited. I almost believed me.  I mean, I was the Wonder Woman of the Woods at first,  for a day Well, for half a day.  Then I got so hungry.  Then I had to steal frozen food from the Outdoor Ed Center,  and then the microwave from the ranger's cabin.  And is that a Wi-Fi router?  Yeah. Do you need the password?  - You're a total fraud. - Um, ouch?  And you probably never climbed Mount Windygap by yourself.  The mountain? (chuckles)  No. It's a mountain.  Well, guess who's trying to climb that mountain  in the rain by herself.  Ooh! Is it someone famous?  No. Our sister! Remember? There was three of us?  One was hanging on your every lying word?  Crap. What could I do? She was staring at me  with those ""I want you to climb the mountain"" eyes.  - We know those eyes. - Gene, we need to get help  - from grown-ups. - I'm a  - Real grown-ups. - Gotcha.    Mr. Frond, we need your help.  Not now, Louise. I'm swamped.  Whatever you're thinking about doing  with that banana and those plums, don't!  - It's an emergency. - Everything's an emergency!  I've got six kids locked out of their cabins,  another six locked in, and I have a kink in my neck  'cause I don't have my neck pillow.  You're not listening!  A hermit has led Tina astray!  She's going up the mountain!  Damn it, Andy and Ollie, don't kiss the weasel!  It's got mites!  Where's the rescue party?  You're lookin' at it.  - Where are you guys going? - Is it anywhere but here?  Yeah, we can't take it in there anymore.  I can't stand any more songs that start at different times.  Rounds. They're called rounds.  - What's round? - Ugh!  So what are you guys doing?  - Going to save Tina's life. - What? Where is she?  Trying to get to the top of Mount Windygap in the rain  -by herself, thanks to Hermit the Fraud over here. - Hi.  - Can we come with? - Sure, fine, but we're going now.  - ZEKE: Let's move! - TAMMY: Ugh. Can we rescue someone else?  Bob? Linda?  You in there? You gotta open up!  It's way past restaurant time.  LINDA: Teddy! We're up here, Teddy.  - Linda? I can't see you. - We're up here. We're up here.  Where are you, Linda?  I can hear you, but I can't see you!  - Look up, Teddy. - Oh. you're up there.  - Why didn't you just say you're up there? - She did say it.  Oh. I get a strong whiff of vomit. What happened there?  - Vomit. - We went to the Lucky Lizard,  and then some lizards followed us home,  and the whole place is trashed.  Really? I'm proud of you. I'm so proud of you.  - Thanks, Teddy. - You guys look weird.  - We got some color. - Got some color. Good for you.  So, uh, about the burger?  It's gonna be a while, Teddy.  I'll wait. Maybe down the block a little.  Kind of stinks here. You stunk up the block, Bobby.  But I'm proud of ya!  FROND: Okay, okay,  Henry Haber got his nasal irrigation kit. Check.  The Belchers. They-they wanted something.  Where'd they go?  Everything okay? You look really sweaty.  It's fine. It's nothing. A couple of kids were saying  something about their sister going up the mountain  in the rain, and something about a hermit.  Probably just messing with me, out of respect.  - Hermit? Did you say hermit? - I don't know!  I-I don't have a recording of everything I've said!    I'm gonna get you, hermit  and/or missing kid.  (grunting)  You're not gonna stop me, rain. I'm almost there.  (rumbling)  Aah! Damn it, rain, I didn't know you were gonna bring  your friends, mud and rocks!  Okay, okay, too steep in there to go forward,  no trail anymore to go back. Cool, cool.  So I'll just live here. Good plan.  Help!  (panting): Wait! Everyone, just wait!  - So you're the Windygap Hermit? - Yes.  - Eh. - Barely.  I've dedicated the last 14 days of my life to catching you.  Can this wait? We need to rescue my sister.  Damn it! You're right. Listen, hermit,  we'll work together to rescue this kid,  but right after that, you're getting a citation  for illegal camping and possible microwave taking.  - Fine. - Great.  - Great. - Just one more thing.  I wasn't expecting you to be so not a man.  Okay, that's it. Let's go rescue this kid.  Oh damn you, nature.  GENE: Tina! We're here!  You're gonna live! Probably!  Watch your step. The trail washed out.  - (gasping) - JOCELYN: Oh, my God!  - Yeah, it does that. - Damn!  I think we did this rescue thing wrong!  I'll radio this in.  Oh crap.  I'm starting to think it was a bad idea  to try this alone I'm no warrior hermit  like you, Martha.  Yeah, about that, Martha  Right. So  Tina, look, I never reached the top of Mount Windygap alone.  I'm not really technically a hermit, I guess.  What? But all that stuff you said, it seemed so true.  That's because I was throwing a hatchet.  Everything sounds great when you're throwing a hatchet.  Look, I tried to be a real hermit, I really, really did,  but it's so hard and so boring and so wet and so cold.  - So why didn't you just go home? - It's complicated.  I had my own team-building issues,  and label issues.  Like when your hip brand management company  expects you to run a small team and you're stuck with Brian,  who undermines everything!  And I'm the mean lady who told him to stop saying  ""Brian no likey"" during meetings! That's a label!  Can we talk about this later? We got to find a way down.  I don't think we can go down. I think the only way out is up.  (sobs) I will kill you if I die out here, Fluffy-Butt!  Me, too. I don't want to die in this jacket.  Really? I think that jacket's cute.  - You do? - I'd totally die in that jacket.  Now I wanna die in it.  Oh, yay! Somebody finally ate my leftover Linguini.  (sighs) Do we have to do this? Can't we just move or something?  No, no, no. The kids cannot know this happened.  If we get busted for having people over,  we'll never be able to tell them not to do dumb things like this.  And clean, and clean, and clean.  I'm cleaning, I'm cleaning.  I mean, I'm just throwing everything away.  - Is that cleaning? - No, that's a plate!  I don't want to alarm anyone,  but this rain is gonna wash us off the rock.  And not in a good way!  Outdoor Ed, why have you forsaken us?!  Oh, Outdoor Ed. The Outdoor Ed video.  Guys, we can get to safety. We'll have to work together.  - Fine, great, let's do it. How? - In the video, there are  these kids doing this thing where they put their hands  You're talking about the four-man hoist-and-pull.  That won't work. The rain makes it impossible.  No, not that. It was a ropes course thing,  where two people lean out and put their hands together.  - Oh, yeah. The two-man steeple. - Can we say ""person""?  Sorry, all the names are from a pamphlet Teddy Roosevelt wrote.  Oh, good, really interesting! Tina, what do we do?!  You lean out towards the person across from you and grab hands.  Tammy, you and me. On the count of three.  One, two  Wait, what? What?  Lean to me now!  It's working! Now we sidestep.  (grunting)  Come on, guys, partner up and get moving.  - Here we go. - Here, climb on.  (all grunting)  (gasping)  We made it  to the top of Mount Windygap!  - Ah - Yeah!  - Sweet. - Wuff.  You guys, it's happening.  We're having our nature-iphanies.  - Do what? - Our epiphanies in nature.  I'm realizing you can't level up all alone,  but you also can't rely on other people  to make you feel the way you want to feel.  It takes both teamwork and alone stuff.  - I taught her that. - So I don't care  if people call me Fluffy-Butt  or Teagle it doesn't matter.  - Teagle? - A cross between Tina and eagle.  Anyway, I know who I am.  - (bird cries) - (gasps) An eagle? Where?  - Nah, it's just a crow. - (high-pitched): Fluffy-Butt.  - Did that crow just say ""Fluffy-Butt""? - What? No.  - (high-pitched): Fluffy-Butt. - Oh, maybe.  - Even if it did, I don't mind it. -(high-pitched): Fluffy-Butt.  Okay, that's enough.  So, uh (clears throat)  hermit, is there a his-met?  Ranger Carl, are you hitting on me?  Yeah, he is!  So, how was it? Tell us everything.  (sighs): Ah, where do I even begin?  Wait. (sniffs)  It smells like beer. And puke.  Uh, that's your mom's, uh, new, uh, new perfume.  Did you throw a party while we were out of town?  Some kind of tanning party?  A party? (scoffs) Us? What are you No!  GENE: There's a middle-aged lady in my bed.  - Uh-oh. - WOMAN: Ooh! Hi!  Is there any Linguini left?  - LINDA: Ah, crap. - Aha!  RANGER CARL:  Who's that knockin' on my hole?   KIDS:  Who's that knockin' on my hole?   RANGER CARL:  Weasel, weasel, if you please'll   KIDS:  Weasel, weasel, if you please'll   Whoo, whoo   Whoo, whoo, whoo   Whoo, whoo   Whoo, whoo, whoo   RANGER CARL: Really do it like a weasel would.  Second verse, same as the first   Who's that knockin' on my hole?  Come on!  Who's that knockin' on my hole?   Weasel, weasel, if you please'll   Weasel, weasel, if you"
"1  It's a good thing I'm finally  trimming your bangs, Gene.  You probably couldn't see anything.  - Could you see anything? - Who's talking?  Personally, I enjoyed watching you bump into things.  Huh. I feel like I forgot to do something else important.  Something yesterday.  Did you forget to take out the trash?  - Did you forget to fart? - No.  Did you forget where you came from?  You're from the streets, Mom. From the streets.  No. Darn it! It's on the tip of my tongue.  Oh, well. Maybe I'll go downstairs and ask  your father!  Oh Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  - What, what? Mom? - Mom! What is it?  - Wh-What What's happening? - Y-Yesterday was  was your father's birthday!  No, it wasn't, that's not until Oh, wait, yeah, it was.  It totally was.  I forgot your father's birthday.  No, no, why?  Why, God? No!  I feel bad for Dad.  I feel bad for Mom.  Look at her. She's a hot mess.  Speaking of hot mess Gene, you might  want to take a look in the mirror real quick.  My bangs are bungled!  I have bungled bangs! Why?!  - No, no, no, why?! - No, no, why?!  Yeah.  - Bob's Burgers. - Bob, it's Teddy.  - Hey, Teddy. - I'm sure you noticed  I haven't come in for a few days.  I did. I mean, I just noticed.  I'm out of town with my mom.  She signed us up for a silent retreat.  Teddy, isn't the point of a silent retreat not to talk?  I'm calling to see if you opened  the birthday e-card that I sent you yesterday.  Yeah, I was going to, but it wanted me to download  three new programs It just seemed like too many.  It's a picture of a dog drinking a soda,  a-and when you click on it, he burps and says ""Happy Burpday!""  I-It's a It's a little  bit of a thinker.  - Yep, that's kind of funny. - Open it.  I actually am in the middle of something right now, Teddy.  I'm in one of those Internet auctions,  trying to get this vintage bacon weight I've had my eye on.  Geez. You didn't get enough presents yesterday?  I'm assuming Linda went all out, right?  Actually, no. She didn't do anything.  I-It was a little weird. Maybe she forgot.  Bob, there's no way Linda forgot your birthday.  Sir, I can't understand what you're mouthing.  ""Get off the phone""?  Okay, Teddy, I'll talk to you later.  Say hi to your mom for me.  Hey, Mom, Bobby says hi.  Hey, Mom. Mom.  Ma! Mom!  Why?  Don't be so hard on yourself, Mom.  We forgot his birthday, too,  -if that makes you feel any better. - It's true.  Oh, it does. No, it doesn't. There's no excuse.  I can't walk around like this. This isn't me!  I'm not an Icelandic punk rocker.  Oh, I'm sorry, Gene. I'll fix it later.  First I need to fix this situation with your father.  Why didn't he say anything?  Were there hints or signs that I missed?  My driver's license expired today.  Wow, Mister Popular over here.  So glad Facebook reminded me  that it's your special day!  Nope, nothing.  How could we ever make this up to him?  - Maybe apologize? - Fake a coma?  Wait a minute. I know  what we have to do.  We have to give your father a surprise party. Tonight!  - Tonight? - Yes, yes, tonight.  We-We just got to get your father out of the restaurant  for a while. That way I can say  I was pretending to forget his birthday,  just to set up the best surprise ever.  Like the end of that movie, Seven.  Hi, Bobby.  Hi, guys. Hi, Tina.  You're standing really close to me.  Hi, Dad. How are you today?  Hey, you know the guy who makes the huge bubbles down at the wharf?  - Um, the Bubble Master? - Well, I heard he's making them  bigger than ever these days.  Maybe you should check him out.  That's a great idea, Tina.  Bob, you should go down there for, uh, three hours.  What? No. We have to prep for dinner.  Also, everyone knows the Bubble Master  doesn't work past noon He doesn't need to.  He makes a fortune. I think about him a lot.  - Oh. - Gene, your hair looks  uh, great. ""Great"" was my first thought.  The people who did this to me will be prosecuted  to the fullest extent of the law!  Damn it.  - What was that? - Oh, just this dumb online auction.  What are you bidding on One of those flashlights  that can blind a bear?  A bunch of Ritalin from Canada?  Just this vintage bacon weight.  - Hello, Belcher family. - Hi, everyone.  Hi, Hugo. Hi, Ron.  What do you want, Hugo?  - Guess what time it is. - W-What time is it?  Health inspection o'clock.  - Hmm. - Come on, Bob. Let's do this.  All right. Hopefully no one outbids me on this  Crap.  Wait, wait. Uh, hold on, Bob.  Why don't, uh, I just go with Hugo and Ron,  and, uh, that way you can stay here,  watch the dining room and finish your thing.  Oh, uh, great. Thanks, Lin.  Let's start in the basement, where molds and bacteria  start their families.  This is weird everything seems to be in order down here.  Ron, you find anything?  I thought I saw a dead mouse,  but it was a potato next to a string bean.  Psst, Hugo, Ron. Come here.  What's going on? Why are you whispering?  Shh, shh, shh. I'm planning a surprise party  for Bob's birthday, and I need to get him out  of the restaurant for a few hours.  Is there any way you two could help me?  Help you with Bob's birthday?  Do you have any idea how uncomfortable  - that would be for me? - What? Why?  Linda. You and I were fiancÃ©s once.  Yeah, I remember. Kinda.  Those were the best four and a half days of my life.  - Okay. - And now you want me to help you  - plan a party for your husband? - Yeah.  Well then, I'm gonna need something out of this, too.  - Like fries? - No, Ron, not like fries!  Okay, Hugo, what is it you want?  I want I want you  to call my parents.  - What? - It would make a big impression  if you called and asked them in a sad,  almost begging tone, if there's any possible chance  that I'm still single.  Oh, Hugo.  - Oh, Hugo. - Oh, shut up, Ron.  You know what? I'll do it. I'll call them.  But only if you can get Bob away,  and keep him away until 7:00 tonight.  - Do we have a deal? - Deal.  - Now, let me hear you do it. - Do what?  The call. What're you gonna say?  Oh, uh. Hello, this is Linda.  - Is Hugo still single? - Sadder.  Oh, um, uh  Is Hugo still single?  - I hope so. - Too much. Split the difference.  Uh, so, how'd the auction go?  Not good. BaconltToTheLimit31 beat me at the very last second.  Turns out he really does bacon it. Right up to the limit.  He really does.  The bad news is I didn't find anything downstairs.  The good news is that I did find  - something upstairs. - Where?  You need to, um  update and sign your safe food-handling license.  W-Wait, what? I-I don't even think this one's expired, by the way.  Uh, yup. This thing's super expired.  Might as well tear it up.  This is ridiculous.  It is ridiculous.  You're attempting to operate a restaurant  with a torn-up food-handling license.  That's why you need to come down to the Health Department office  and sign for a new license.  In person. Right now. Or I shut you down.  You can't be serious.  Bob, maybe you should just go.  Take as much time as you need.  All right, fine. I'll drive down there,  but this better be quick.  Uh, you? Drive? No, no, no, no, no.  They would never let you in without a certified vehicle.  W-Wait, what do you mean, ""a certified vehicle""?  Get in the van, Bob.  Or, as I like to call it, Health on Wheels.  Oh, my God.  Okay, we only have a few hours to plan this party  and hide the fact that we all forgot your father's birthday.  And if we pull this off, we shall never  speak of this in our family again.  Like that time I caught Dad flexing his legs in the mirror.  We can do this. I mean, I love to plan parties. That's my thing.  That and talking during movies.  All right, we need, uh, decorations and gifts  and guests and refreshments.  I can be in charge of decorations.  - Great. - Yes!  Gene, Louise, what do you want to be in charge of?  Uh, I can't help until my hair is  slightly more back to full hotness.  All right, how about I give you ten dollars  and you go ask Gretchen if she can fix it?  Or better idea I'll help Gene with his hair.  And I'll do it for a discounted rate of only eight dollars.  But I don't have any change, so I'll just take this.  Okay, okay, just do it quick.  I'm gonna start making calls.  Everybody, hands in the middle.  Let's throw a party to cover up the fact  we forgot Dad's birthday!  Let's throw a party to cover up the fact  we forgot Dad's birthday.  Is that sound coming from the van?  I've been telling Hugo to get it checked for months.  It's fine. It's probably just a rusty wheel plug.  - A rusty wheel plug? - That's not a thing.  Oh, are you both van experts now?  You know what? I don't really care.  I just want to get this over with as soon as possible  and get back to work.  And what do you think we do, Bob?  You don't think we work, too, Bob?  I know you work, Hugo.  I'm sure it's exhausting harassing people  and trying to shut down literally  every restaurant in town.  - Ow! - Harassing people? Wow.  Bob, health inspectors are the thin green line  between the diners of this town  and gastrointestinal catastrophe.  - Preach. - You know what?  I'd like to show you something.  Is it something that will  - make this day take longer? - Yes.  You're coming with us on an inspection.  No, no, no, no. No.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Welcome to your worst nightmare, Bob.  Except worse, because of all the violations.  Hugo, has this place even opened yet?  It opens next week. What's your point?  How bad can it be? It looks like a nice place.  It's probably just a nice person serving nice food.  Oh, is it nice food, Bob?  Is it a nice person serving nice food, Bob?  I don't know how you get through the day, Ron.  - What? - Why don't you put your mouth  where your mouth is?  No matter what happens in there, no matter what you see,  no matter what you smell,  you will eat a wrap at the end of this inspection.  Yeah, I'll eat a wrap. I'll eat the crap out of a wrap.  Okay. After you.  Wait, no, you go after me. Ron, get the door.  Ooh, wow. Real-life health inspectors in my restaurant?  Now this is getting real.  Now, this is getting very real.  I'm sorry, I didn't get your name?  Don't worry about him. He's just a guy named Bob. Bob Dork.  - That's not my name. - He's not a health inspector.  - Thank God. - He just wishes he was.  - And he doesn't talk. - Mm.  We're still in the middle of our ""medium soft practice  kinda-sorta not really opening"" opening.  Hey, where do you guys think this plant should go?  - Here? Here? - Mm.  - Mm. Mm. Mm. - Here? Here?  - You don't sound happy. Here? - Mm.  - Here? - Uh, yeah. There.  - Really? Wow. - O-Or maybe there.  Are you kidding me? We don't care about the plant!  Take us to the kitchen.  Uh, this chicken needs to be stored at 40 degrees or less.  Oh, fun chicken fact. How do you even know that?  Oh, God.  Hold on. When was the last time  you washed this rag?  I'm sorry washed? Are you saying washed the rag?  Oh, God.  There are rodent droppings near your salad prep area!  Oh, that's what those are.  - Okay, you can just flick them away. - Oh, God.  So, what do you say, Mort?  You gonna come over to celebrate your favorite burger man?  Gosh, Linda, I wish I could, but I have a funeral tonight.  Can't be in two places at once.  Which, by the way, is how this guy died.  So, what do you say, Reggie You think you can make it?  Aw, geez, Linda, I would, but they  have to check me out of Intensive Care.  Just a little heart attack, nothing to worry about.  Oh-oh, my God, Reggie, I'm so sorry,  but I got to call you back tomorrow. Okay, bye.  Delightful. I will absolutely be there. Count me in.  Oh, really, Mr. Fischoeder? That's great.  Wait, who-who is this?  It-It's Linda. Lin  From Linda and Bob?  Oh, I can't make it.  I, um, a dog is, uh,  biting my, uh, leg.  You can bring the dog, if you come.  Mm, he doesn't want to go.  - So, how did I do? - Not good.  - So not too shabby? - No!  You did bad.  I don't understand. I-I did everything right.  You did almost nothing right.  Okay, so what does this mean for the restaurant?  It means the last wrap you're making today  - is for Bob. - Oh. Okay.  And while you do that, I'm going to read off your violations.  Dirty utensils. Illegal use of the finger.  Strange, booger-looking viscous material  on your cutting board.  Keep chewing. We had a deal.  Excessively thick milk.  Moldy mango. Fuzzy tortillas.  Mom, I know you're busy, but look whose hair  is perfectly normal.  Does he have magic marker on his forehead?  I'm really surprised you noticed,  but I don't think anyone else is going to be able to tell.  I like the smell, but I'm dizzy.  Enough hair talk. I've got a party to plan here.  Reggie was a no. Mort was a no. Teddy's out of town.  Mike the Mailman said he left something in his truck  and then he never came back.  At least we have decorations.  I mean, I'm pulling my weight.  - Tina, the party's upstairs. - What?  Yeah.  Son of a bitch! Why didn't somebody stop me?  Just kidding, I'm just kidding.  You're nailing it. You're nailing it.  I mean, you're not. You're taping it, but  Yeah, I found this tape in the bathroom.  It had a lot of floss on it, but it still works.  You guys having a ""going out of business"" prom, or  Come on.  Oh, go put a cannoli up your holey.  Oh  Hair.  We're planning a surprise party for my dad  and you're not invited.  Oh, yeah? Well, how many people are coming?  Uh we got a few.  I mean, tons. Tons of people.  Whoa  Everyone said no, huh?  - Oh, you shush. - Oh, no!  - Tina, what happened? - Damn floss tape!  This is the saddest surprise party ever.  - When is it? - 7:00.  I'm coming back.  Oh, I cannot wait to see the look  on Bob's dumb face when he cries.  Uh, at least we have Jimmy Pesto. That's one.  You, sir, are hereby prohibited from serving food  until all violations have been corrected.  - You get an F. - Out of ?  Here's the sign. You're supposed to put it in the window.  -'Kay, but what if people see it? - That's the point!  - Ron, Bob, get in the van. - Oh, God.  At least we'll be moving, I guess.  And this will be over soon.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Is smoke supposed to be coming out of the front or the back?  Because it's coming out of both.  - And the sides. - Damn it!  Okay, new plan. All the customers that are here now  Let's just keep 'em here until 7:00.  We'll, uh, pretend they're your dad's friends.  He'll never catch on.  It'll be an extra surprise party. It's not even  people your father knows. It's total strangers.  That's a good idea, right?  Uh, Mom? Are you feeling okay?  - Your eye is twitching. - I'm f-I'm fine. I'm fine.  Miss? I'll-I'll take a check when you get a chance.  - Oh, God. - Stall, Mom, stall.  - Don't give it to her. - Uh No.  - What? - Nice one, bro.  I mean, um, I got to go into the kitchen.  Uh, I won't be back until, uh 7:00.  I know what a dipstick is, Ron.  When you're called something enough times, you look it up.  Wow, I'm really surprised I did so bad.  - I've never done bad at-at anything. - Really?  Ugh, sorry.  I mean, in the finance world, I just kept making money.  - Too much money, you know what I mean? - Uh, yeah.  I mean, no, I don't really know what you mean.  When I said I was gonna open this place, people were like,  ""You should go to school and get training.""  And I was like, ""I just want to open it.  I've got the killer name. The rest'll work itself out.""  Oh, Bob Dork, are you okay?  Do you always sweat this much?  Am-am I sweating? Yeah. I am.  Hmm. You think it's something you ate?  - I do. I really do. - Hey, guys,  I think Bob Dork's not feeling very well.  Are you gonna throw up?  Yeah. A lot.  Geez, you're right in front of my restaurant.  I feel like, you know, you puking plus the ""F"" rating,  it-it might not so look good.  He's fine.  Ev-Everything's fine. Yeah, we open next week.  Come by, lunch and dinner.  Okay, uh, Th-there you go, big fella.  Okay, I-I know some of you don't know Bob that well,  but all you got to do is stick around till he shows up,  you say, ""Surprise,"" and I'll give you all free ice cream.  - That's pretty sad. - Yes, it is.  This is gonna be hilarious.  Guy probably doesn't even like surprise parties.  What do you mean? Everybody likes surprise parties.  That's a known fact.  Uh, yeah, Linda. Everybody loves  coming back to their peaceful abode  and having a bunch of people jump out and scream at 'em.  Or ""Surprise"" or whatever.  Huh. That is true, Mom.  Dad doesn't like parties very much.  - Or surprises. - Or us. Well, you guys.  Oh, my God. I guess that's true.  Just because I like throwing parties  doesn't mean he likes having 'em thrown for him.  I was so caught up in all the party planning,  I missed what was right in front of me.  Your boobs?  I know what we need to do.  Is it something with your boobs?  No. Get off the boobs, guys. We're moving on.  Never!  Well, Bob, is there anything you want to say  about health inspectors?  Okay, Hugo. You were right. I admit it.  Y-You have a very important job.  You keep people safe from restaurants like Sam's.  It's nice to be appreciated, Bob.  And I can smell how much you mean it.  You know, in finance, there's no inspectors.  You just don't need 'em.  You know, Hugo, we need to get Bob back by 7:00.  If a certain phone call is going to happen?  You know what? I don't care, Ron.  Watching Bob vomit and say how cool health inspectors are  is way better than that phone call ever would've been.  What are you guys talking about?  Let's just stick him in a cab and call a tow.  I might have an alcoholic drink tonight, an alcoholic wine.  Wait, don't I have to go to your office to   sign a form?  ""Sign a form.""  That's you, Bob.  Forget about the license. We'll do it later.  Consider it a birthday present.  Oh, is it your birthday, Bob Dork?  Wait, h-how did you know it was my birthday?  Uh Ron told me.  Uh yeah, I know everyone's birthday.  It's a blessing and a curse.  Oh, God. Did Linda ask you to get me out of the restaurant  so she could set something up? Is this all made up?  Uh Ah, fine. Yes.  Wait, was my health inspection made up, too?  No, your restaurant's disgusting.  - Mm. Fair enough. - Oh, I really don't want to go  - to a surprise birthday party. - You don't? Why not?  I don't like surprise parties or non-surprise parties.  Oh, do you think your birthday is about you, Bob?  - Huh? - It's not.  It's about the people who care about you  showing that they care about you.  And you don't complain about it, you appreciate it!  Unless you're a baby. Are you a baby, Bob?  No.  Well, you are throwing up a lot. Like a baby.  Do you know what I would give for someone anyone  To celebrate me? I have no one.  - No one! - Well, you have one person.  - No one! - You have Oh.  Oh, God. Hugo, I-I can't believe  I'm about to say this, but  I I think you might be right. Again.  You do?  Yeah. I shouldn't complain about a surprise party  if it makes Linda happy to throw one.  Go to her, Bob.  - I need a ride. - I can give you a ride.  I've got a convertible, so you can just puke over the side  - if you need to. - I will need to, Sam.  I will need to. Oh, and Hugo?  - Um, thanks. - I hate you.  - What's that? - Nothing. Uh, happy birthday.  I hate you.  Uh, thanks for the ride, Sam.  Uh, listen, don't take this the wrong way, but, um,  chef to chef, you should get some training.  Um, maybe a lot of training.  Or maybe I'll just switch to something easier, like sushi.  That's fish, right?  - Hey, Gene. - Aah! He's here. He's here.  And he definitely didn't see me.  Okay, act surprised. Just  just act surprised and smile.  That's not a smile.  That's a smile. I think.  Hello?  Hello? Hello?  Hi, Bobby.  Hi. Is anyone else here?  - Just us. - Hello, Father. -Hi, Dad.  Hi, kids. Gene, I like it. I like what you're doing there.  Thank you. I'm turning lemons into  ""lemme tell you about my hair.""  So there's not a room full of people  waiting to jump out and yell, ""Surprise""?  Bob, listen. The truth is  we all forgot about your birthday yesterday,  and Wait, how'd you know we were planning a surprise party?  Hugo and Ron spilled the beans.  I'm sorry, Bob.  I felt awful about forgetting your birthday,  and I really wanted to make it up to you.  - It's okay, honestly. - Well, it's not okay to me.  At first we wanted to throw you a party,  but then we realized that's probably not what you wanted,  so we canceled it.  Dad, you should've seen how many people showed up.  And the streamers looked amazing.  So, we got you what we think you really wanted.  Bobby, I present to you your belated birthday present.  The couch?  Yes, but not just the couch.  Also, we put one of your Western flicks in the DVD player,  and we made you a freshly grilled steak. Look.  And I promise it always had those bites taken out of it.  And we warmed up your sweatpants in the dryer,  -the way you like them. - Hot pants. -Toasted buns.  It's perfect. It's absolutely perfect.  Really?  Yeah. I mean, I was ready for a big party.  I-I really was, because I know you like to throw those,  and that's totally fine.  Okay. Sounds like it's not fine, but go on.  This is so much better.  Oh, oh, I almost forgot. Uh, here, for you.  - Here you go. - Oh, my God!  It's the bacon weight. H-How did you get this?  I drove over to the antique shop in Bog Harbor.  Oh, it feels nice. Really nice.  - Get a room. - I will.  Having a real rager for  your birthday, huh, Bob?  Oh! Keep it down up there  or I'm calling the cops.  - Ha, ha. You're dumb. - No, Jimmy, you're  On your left, ma'am.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's  Can't stop watching. Jimmy, you all right?  I'm all right.  He'll probably be fine. Let's start the movie.  Stupid bike. Drive a car, you cave man!  This really is the best birthday ever.  Aah!  Happy birthday   Happy birthday   We forgot about your birthday   And then you threw up   Oh, no   Happy birthday, Bob   We forgot it then you threw up, we forgot it   Then you threw up, we forgot it then you threw up   We forgot it then you threw up, we forgot it   Then you threw up   Sorry."
"1  TINA: Whoa, the beach is littered with tourists and litter.  LOUISE: Who just lays on a blanket all day?  Yeah, give your couch another try!  - Couches are wonderful! - Totally.  And I hate how the water makes the sand stick to your  - (whistle blows) - Sugar cookies!  -  skin. - (laughter)  That's a lot of contact.  Good idea. We should go in for a closer look.  Hey. Hi. We were just wondering why you're rolling around  in the sand like that? On each other? No judgment.  - We're doing sugar cookies. - Sugar cookies?  The sand's the sugar, we're the cookies.  Listen, pal, if sand was sugar, I'd know it.  It's a cool way for the squad to bond. And warm up.  The squad? What kind of squad is it anyway?  Just curious about squads, mainly this one.  - We're junior lifeguards. - We get to do several  of the same drills actual lifeguards do.  And when we graduate, our squad's picture will go  on the wall of honor in the lifeguard station.  Just above the copier. So  - Wow. - Well, thank you for you service  - to our beach, to yourselves. - (whistle blows)  Hydrate, snack, sunscreen!  (laughing, panting)  So how does one become a junior lifeguard?  Well, you got to love, but also respect, the beach.  That's so funny. I was just saying  how much I love, but also respect the beach.  Ha!  You got to be a strong open ocean swimmer,  you got to thrive in a disciplined environment,  and you got to enjoy hard work.  - It's like you people know me. - GENE: Hmm?  So where do I sign up?  Sign-ups were last week.  Kelly's right. This session already started,  and we're at capacity.  Thanks for the helpful bit of info, Kelly.  No prob. Hey, Michael, want me to get your back?  Sure, and I'll get your back.  - So much contact. - (whistle blowing)  - Partner up for the buoy swim! - (laughter)  You can always sign up for the next session.  - When's that? - Next year!  Next year? That's in, like, a million years!  Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!  I fell in a dumb hole!  - Kelly, don't move, girl. - Ow! Ow!  We're looking at a grade three sprain.  - (gasping) - Ooh! - Aah!  - But that'll take weeks to heal! - It's true.  And by then, this session will be over.  Oh, my God. I wish I never even had stupid ankles.  Parker, Willow, help her to the station.  - (groaning) - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!  Why don't stupid people fill in holes?  Speaking of filling in, since Kelly's out,  does that mean I can fill in for her?  Huh. Let me think about that.  Mm. Let me ask you this.  Why do you want to be a junior lifeguard?  I want to be a junior lifeguard because  - (laughing) - Ah.  Because I love the beach, I'm a very, very strong swimmer,  I'm super into discipline,  and I've always wanted to be a lifeguard.  Yup, all true. You can check my journal.  Uh, can we get the Wi-Fi password?  The-the Wi-Fi password?  Yeah, for the network ""Kids Trapped Send Help.""  Oh, uh, that's my family's Wi-Fi network.  My-my kids named it that. They're not really trapped.  I just don't know how to change it.  Uh, pretty sure it's pronounced ""wiffy,"" right?  Dude, it's ""Wi-Fi.""  I think I mean, I think it's ""Wi-Fi.""  Are we sure? Everyone's in agreement it's ""Wi-Fi""?  Yeah.  Well, I'm gonna keep calling it ""wiffy"" in  my head. Can't stop me from doing that.  So, can I get the password?  Right, but it's my family's personal home network  for upstairs family use, so  Should we go across the street? I'm pretty sure they have Wi-Fi.  The password is ""dadsbald,"" all lowercase one word.  - Lin! - Great. Thank you.  Bob, people expect to have Wi-Fi nowadays.  Free Wi-Fi is this generation's free pens at the bank.  Those pens aren't free, Lin.  You have to break the chain to get the pen.  Yeah, it's easy. -But maybe free Wi-Fi is good for business.  - TEDDY (laughs): That guy falls. - Except for Teddy,  - using it here for that. - Oh, that's got to hurt.  (door bells jingles, whistle blows)  Everyone, out of the water!  Why am I saying that, you ask?  - No. I mean, yes. - Because I am  As soon as you sign this fun  and mostly filled-out permission form  The newest member of the famous Junior Lifeguards.  - So famous. - So junior.  Um, Tina, should we work on your swimming?  I remember you not knowing how to do that so great.  - Don't write that. - It's fine. She floats.  - It's like me. We're floaters. - All right.  Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.  - Ow. - It's not.  All right, gang, it's time to officially welcome Tina here  - into the Junior Lifeguards. - Thanks, Zack.  Couple things about me I go to school, I live at home.  And I swim really, really well.  Okay, cool. Thanks a lot, Tina.  Oh, and I'm pretty single right now.  I believe you guys were wondering about that earlier.  All right, time to stretch out, everybody.  Look, I know I'm only here  because Kelly had that super embarrassing fall.  Yes, I'm taking her place, but I'm not the new Kelly.  Michael, whatever you had with Kelly  doesn't just mean you have that with me.  No, yeah, I-I know that  - Unless it does. - (whistle blowing)  Tina, less talking, more stretching!  Sorry! Hey, how about some of us start a second row back here?  Uh, this is too much, actually.  - I'm coming back. - Tina, stop messing around!  (whistle blowing)  All right, guys, let's set up for a paddle relay.  Or we dive right into sugar cookies?  - Some of us haven't done that yet? -(whistle blows)  All right, that's it. Drop and give me 20. Everybody!  - Why everybody? - Because, Parker, this is a squad.  You sink or swim, or save sinking swimmers as a squad.  (all groaning)  - Thanks a lot, Tina. - (groaning)  High step, high step and dolphin dive!  - Great dolphin, Willow. - Thanks!  Tina, you're the last one.  Okay. Wow that's cold.  This is gonna take me a few minutes to ease in.  Run! Now! Go!  Aah! Aah!  (coughs)  That's enough of the water for me today.  Are there some indoor drills we can do?  - (whistle blows) - We're startin' over! - What?!  The squad does not finish  until everyone can get past the breakers.  - So unfair! - Huh. If ever there was a time  to do sugar cookies, am I right?  Who wants to show me the proper rhythm for chest compressions  on Can't Breathe-y Stevie here?  Jason, you ready to shine, bro?  So, what do you think of Jason? I'm pretty sure he's into you.  - Jason's my brother. - Oh. I was wondering  why you both said ""Bye, Mom"" to the same lady.  Still, there's something there.  So, whatcha writing? A novel?  What? Oh, no, just catching up on e-mail.  Ooh, is it an e-mail to your publisher about your novel?  No. I-It's about the kids' soccer schedule.  - Oh. - (laughs)  I can't believe we didn't think of free Wi-Fi before.  It's busy, but calm.  Everyone's happy just staring at their screens.  Yeah, but I thought it'd be different.  Like, creative people, writing the next big thing,  free-flowing ideas.  Instead it's just e-mail and online shopping,  and whatever that guy's watching and crying about.  Uh, it's the British Baking Show.  Yeah, some old guy made a Swiss roll  that made me feel something, for once.  It's weird that this is how they choose the prime minister.  - (bell jingles) - There's my little Tina-la Anderson.  Was your first day at the beach a day at the beach?  Ugh, I'm tired, but also exhilarated.  So, what did we learn?  Well, we learned that Michael and Kelly are still texting  each other even though she's not in Junior Guards anymore.  Which is fine. Love triangles are pretty common  in JGs, I think.  Right, but did you learn anything about life-guarding,  or swimming?  Geez, Dad, give the girl a break.  She's probably exhausted  from staring at all those lifeguard butts.  - Oh, my God. - Well, I'm gonna go rest up.  Tomorrow is another big day of drama on the beach, starring me.  Beach drama   Beach drama, whoa   Beach drama, beach drama   Can't Breathe-y Stevie   Ooh, ooh   Beach drama.   (whistle blowing)  When you're done cleaning the boards, you can go.  And I hope it's as un-fun as it looks.  It is un-fun. And it's messed up  that we're all punished when only one of us is messing up.  Well, it might be ""messed up,""  but it's how we do things in Junior Guards, gang.  That person you're referring to needs to think long and hard  about why she's here.  And that she can quit at any time.  'Cause if this continues, I'm not so sure  this squad is gonna graduate next week.  - Jeesh, what's his problem? - You.  - You're the problem. - Yeah. Just quit, Tina.  Okay, I-I think we all just need to cool down and lotion up.  Want me to get your back, Michael?  No, I don't want you to get my back.  I just want to get through one day  without you getting us in trouble.  Ouch. (chuckles)  Tina, why are you even here? You're not JGM.  - What's JGM? - (groans)  Junior Guard Material.  Face it, Tina, you're a screw-up.  But I'm the lovable screw-up. We all have our roles.  He's the hot one, he's also the hot one. You guys get it.  Tina, Zack, Jason and Parker are right.  Mm, I think Willow said it, too.  You should really think about quitting.  - Yeah. - Oh, if that's how you all feel,  then, fine, I guess I'll quit.  What was that, Michael? I should stay? I'm the quiet leader?  Did not say anything.  Oh. So, n-no one's gonna stop me?  Fine.  I'm gonna turn in my whistle and can.  (laughs) Bob, have you seen that video  where the monkey falls out of the tree  after he smells his stinky finger?  Take your headphones off, Teddy. You're talking way too loud.  Yeah, he scratches his butt, then he smells his finger,  then he falls right out of the tree.  Oh, I'm not doing it justice.  I can't describe it. Y-You got to see it for yourself.  - Teddy! Take your head - No, I'm just gonna forward it to you.  Ugh. Forget it.  Here's your order.  In the mouth, headed south.  Ha, ha!  Nothing? Really?  You're not gonna look up from the screen,  even with me talking to you now?  Hello? I put poison in your fries.  Okay, that's it. That's enough screen time, people!  Let's all take a ten-minute break.  - Lin. - Okay, I'm going upstairs  - to unplug the router. - No, no, no, Lin.  The Wi-Fi has been good for business.  It's good for business, but bad for humans.  I don't want to live in a world where people don't look up  and smile at me when I say hilarious stuff.  Aw. Not you, too, Sergeant Bosco.  Shush, shh, shh. Shut up.  Don't say my name.  I'm undercover.  Um, but your badge is right there.  Damn it. Don't look at me.  Just act normal and pretend I'm a customer.  Uh, what would you like to eat today, Sergeant Customer?  I'll, uh, have, uh mm, a coffee.  - GENE: Very natural. - Shush!  (whispering): Um, why are you undercover?  I'm investigating cyber robberies, that's why.  Hence the shorts.  Some scumbag on your Wi-Fi network  is hacking into people's computers  and stealing identities and credit card numbers  and buying some really dumb stuff online.  (gasps) Who is it?  If I knew that, I wouldn't be undercover, would I?  Um, it says ""police"" on the back of your shirt.  Got-dangit!  (quietly): Bob, change shirts with me.  Um, no.  So someone in the restaurant is a computer hacker, huh?  Well, it's something.  Okay, I'm in.  What do you what do you mean, you're in?  I'm in. Let's go, let's do it, baby.  - What? - Is it him?  - Is it her? Is it is it her? - Her what? -Is it him?  - BOSCO: What are you talking about? No. - GENE: Is it him?  - Not No. - LOUISE: Is it that one? -GENE: Him.  - LOUISE: What about that one? - I don't know. Shh!  You shush. We're helping.  ZACK: Yeah. Uh-huh.  Okay. Sure. Yeah, we can make  the fun run a 3K instead of a 2K this year.  Yeah, another K is no prob.  Okay, look, I got to go. The other line's ringing.  Lifeguard station, this is Zack.  Uh-huh, mm-hmm,  you want to move the sand castle contest to south of the pier?  I bet you can't wait to get up on that wall of honor.  (sighs) I'm not going up on the wall.  Sure you are. You're a Junior Lifeguard, ain't ya?  Not for much longer.  I'm turning in my whistle and my can.  What?! I can't think of a reason  anyone would want to leave the Junior Guards.  The truth is, I only signed up  to be around shirtless, teen boys.  Oh. Yeah, maybe quit then.  You might not be JGM.  I appreciate what you're trying to do, but really,  I think everyone is right. I should quit.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  But it doesn't feel right to quit.  Tina Belcher isn't a quitter.  But maybe she should be?  Quitting is liberating  and could be the way to go.  That's right, Mr. Old Man, quitting is not the way to go.  I might've joined Junior Guards for the wrong reasons,  but I'm gonna finish it for the right ones.  Sure. Later. Yeah, Tina, what do you need?  - I came in here to quit - Oh, okay, cool.   but a wise, old, wrinkly man convinced me otherwise.  - Ugh, Gus. - I swear, I didn't mean to.  Also, ""wrinkly""? No.  I've taken very good care of my skin.  So, I quit on quitting.  I'm gonna graduate Junior Guards  and I'm getting on that wall right there.  Uh, not that wall. That's the missing person's wall.  Um, that wall.  I can't believe you unquit, Tina.  Now we're never gonna graduate Junior Guards.  Look, we all just need to give me a second chance.  I promise I'm gonna work hard  and I'll keep my eyes on the thighs.  - I mean, prize. - (whistle blows)  Partner up for the buoy swim.  So cold! High step! Aah! High step!  And  (coughs)  I did it. I-I dolphined.  Eh.  (panting)  Well, it wasn't the prettiest buoy swim  and it looked like you swallowed a lot of water out there  All the water.   but you did it without needing to be rescued.  - Nice job, Tina. - Thank you.  It's the bare minimum, but you did it.  Thanks again.  Are you close to finding the cyber crook?  No, no, I'm using some new program  to trace the hack back to the source computer,  but I'm-I'm no good at this tech stuff. I'm terrible.  Maybe hit the keys harder?  Wait a minute.  My Laptop.  ""My Laptop""?  Yeah, it's the name of a computer  that's initiating the attack.  Which one of you is My Laptop?  (quietly): So, we're looking for someone with a lap.  I'm on it.  No, no, get back here. Damn it.  He's the best in the business. You're in good hands.  - I forgot what I was looking for. - My turn.  Don't mind me, I'm just a little girl lost in a restaurant.  Are you my mommy?  Are you my mommy?  You know, your children are awful.  No, I-I know.  (all panting)  Ah, thanks, everybody.  - Whatever. - What's that, Parker?  You might have everyone else fooled,  but I still think you shouldn't be on this squad.  Ugh, come on, Parker.  Tina is really trying.  She hasn't gotten us in trouble in days.  Yeah, and I'm keeping the chest glances to a minimum.  And I'm not even thinking about the love triangle  I'm in with Michael and Kelly.  We're not in a love triangle.  Yes, we are. We're handling it.  You really think she could save your life out there?  You'd be willing to put your life in Tina's hands?  - Um definitely no. - Mm, I guess not.  - That's what I thought. - Guys, come on.  I'm real deal JGM. I'll prove it to you.  What if, um, I-I did the open ocean rescue drill?  Tina, that's not a JG drill, that's an LG drill.  - Right. What's LG again? - Lifeguard.  Right, right, right. But I can still do it. I can.  A-And, you know what, if I can't, then I'll quit.  I just need one of you to volunteer to be my victim.  I mean, to be rescued. Fine.  I think I know where I can find a volunteer.  What do you say, Can't Breathe-y Stevie?  Want to go for a little swim?  Tina, you can do this.  I think, maybe.  Dolphin dive.  (panting)  Come on, Stevie, let's show these guys that I can  Oh, God, you're heavy.  (groaning)  WILLOW: She's doing it, sort of.  Are you absorbing water? Please, don't do that.  - Looks like she's gonna make it. - I can't believe it.  Remain calm. Help has arrived.  Wait a second, is that Ti Tina and Can't Breathe-y Stevie?  What are you doing out here, Stevie?  Oh, hi, Zack.  You come here, too? No way.  Okay. Bye.  So, let me get this straight.  You snuck into the equipment shed,  you stole poor Stevie here,  dropped him into the ocean Probably ruining him  And attempted to perform a non-sanctioned LG rescue drill?  - Did I miss anything? - You missed the part  where I was about to complete an open ocean rescue  to prove to the rest of the Junior Guards that I belong.  Let me stop you right there.  You don't.  None of you do.  In the 58 weeks  that I've been lead instructor of Junior Guards,  I've never had to do this, but guess what?  You're all kicked out.  - What? - (gasping) - Yeah. Yeah.  You break the rules as a squad, you get kicked out as a squad.  You're dismissed forever.  - (sighs) -Ugh. - Oh, boy, um  should we exchange info and stay in touch?  - Ugh. - Plan a reunion?  - Okay, everyone is crying. - Unbelievable.  We can maybe regroup later.  Sorry, Junior Guards of yesteryear.  Don't say sorry to them.  Say sorry to Stevie. He's dead.  Aw, poor baby.  You know, there are a million junior lifeguard programs  in the sea. You'll find another one.  No, this is the only one in the area.  Oh. Well, I'm sorry.  Yeah, sorry, Tina. I know how much fun you were having  being around boys not wearing shirts.  But it was more than that.  I really was loving being a Junior Guard,  being part of a squad that meant something.  At least you get to keep that sweet, sweet whistle.  Oh, no, I got to bring it back tomorrow.  Well, play us something before you bring it back, will you?  Ma-Maybe not. Maybe not.  I-It's a little shrill.  - You let Mom talk. - What?!  (groans)  (sighs) I let you all down.  I really thought I belonged up there with you.  Well, good-bye, lifeguard station.  Good-bye, beach. Good-bye, litter.  Good-bye, sand castle contest.  Good-bye, 3K fun run. Wait.  What the the fun run is on the same day  as the sand castle contest?  And the lifeguards are tending to a level orange,  real-world, Jet Ski reprimand. Oh, no.  Guys, we have a situation.  Why are you wearing that like that?  Because of the situation.  What are you talking about?  Some idiot scheduled a 3K fun run  on the same day as the sand castle contest.  - So what? - ""So what""?  Willow, the fun runners are running into a death trap  for their ankles.  See for yourself.  (gasps) The finish line  is just past the sand castle competition.  TINA: Castles, moats, holes,  and runners headed straight towards them!  If we don't do something,  those sprained ankles are gonna be on us.  What can we do? We're not even Junior Lifeguards anymore.  Should we call it in? Tell the real lifeguards?  They're busy. It's up to us.  We've been trained to deal with this situation, right?  - Not exactly. - But pretty close.  - I mean, kind of. - That's the spirit.  Look, I know there's been some drama  and I know you all think it's my fault  we got kicked out of Junior Guards  - It was. - Totally was.  Uh, right, yeah, sure, possibly.  But right now, we got to put our issues aside, put our love  - triangle on hold, Michael - There's no love triangle.  - Okay, fine. Love square. Looking at you, Jason. - What?   and we go out there and save some innocent ankles.  Now, who's with me?  - I'm in. - Me, too.  - (sighs) - Let's do this.    Aah!  (grunts)  Faster. Hurry.  The fun runners are almost here.  (grunting)  (slow-mo): No.  Aah!  (grunts)  Sergeant Bosco, you're not undercover anymore?  No more shorts?  Yeah, no more shorts, probably ever.  Girl, say it ain't true.  So, you got the guy?  Yeah, but it wasn't a guy. It was a lady.  - (Gasps) The soccer mom. I knew it. - You did?  - No, but I know it now. - Well, that's just her cover.  In reality, she's a hacker, a sort of not-that-great hacker.  But you're a sort of not-that-great cyber cop.  Yup, so it worked out.  So, are we done then?  No. I got to take your router for evidence.  I'll get it back to you as soon as possible,  and when I say that I mean maybe get a new router.  - Hmm. - Anyway, thanks for your help.  I mean, you didn't help, but  can you get the router, please?  Whoa, what the hell is going on here?  I just got a report that a bunch of Junior Guards trashed  - the sand castle contest. - No, no, we were helping.  Tina Belcher. Of course you were behind this.  What are you even doing here?  What are any of you ex-Junior Guards even doing here?  You're kicked out. I already told you that.  Yes, we destroyed the sand castles,  but we were filling in holes and moats  so people wouldn't break their ankles.  ""Break their ankles""?  Look, the fun run finish line was over there,  past the sand castle contest.  What? (scoffs) That can't be.  I think the fun run usually isn't this long.  Plus, the sand castle contest is usually on a Sunday.  Yeah, some idiot put them both on the same day.  Oh, my God.  I may or may not have been that idiot  that we're all talking about right now.  You kids saved the day  and you saved my hide. You're heroes.  Sir, Tina is the one who spotted the situation  and pushed us to do something about it.  She's the real hero here.  Tina, is that true, girl?  I don't want to say hero, but I like hearing it.  Well, then I guess I have no choice  but to let you all graduate  the Junior Lifeguards program.  - (cheering) - All right. - Yes.  And I'm gonna request that you never tell anyone  that I was the one who scheduled all those things  - at the same time. - Yay!  So, go ahead, everybody.  Get up on that pier for your final exam.  - (cheering) - What final exam? - Aw, it's great.  We get to jump off the pier before we graduate.  That pier?  (shouts)  - Come on, Tina, jump! - No, thank you.  You can do it!  - No, I really can't. - Yes, you can.  And, plus, also, you sort of have to in order to graduate.  - Fine, then. I'm out. - Tina, no.  Look, I'll tell you what.  If you jump, you all get to warm up in the sand together.  You mean, sugar cookies?  That's what I'm talking about.  - Aah! - Sugar cookies.  I'm never using a towel again.  Blow that whistle   Make it thunder   Save that guy   He's going under, under   Jump in the water   Hair's getting tangled   Time to check in, on my love triangle, lookin' good   Sand's the sugar and we're the cookies   Sugar cookies   Sand's the sugar and we're the cookies   Sugar cookies   Sand's the sugar and we're the cookies   Sugar cookies   Jump in the water.     MICHAEL: The sand's the sugar, we're the cookies."
"1  Nothing like a game of bike ride trash toss.  Sport of kings.  It's like Quidditch, if Harry Potter's life  took a really sad turn.  Taco wrapper off the back lid.  - Nice, T. - Gene,  I'm loving the new bike basket.  You mean this sweet handlebar candy?  Why should girls have all the fun?  This summer's all about boy baskets.  You're a pioneer.  Now watch me sink these moldy buns  from out in three-point land.  Geez!  Hi, I'm Alice, your new neighbor.  Could you move, please?  - Nice to meet you, too, Alice. - We'll move.  We just have to deal with this pile of garbage.  My name is Gene.  Could you speed it up a smidgen?  Sorry, we're working at full smidgen.  Uh, try doing it like you were strong, healthy children.  What's the racket?  Oh, you guys are playing bike ride trash toss?  - We were. - How's the notary business, Mr. Huggins?  Well, you know what they say about being a notary.  - What? - Nothing. Nobody ever says anything about it.  Hello? Did everyone forget about me?  I did. Sorry.  Smoothies and Hair Removal.""  So, you guys remove hair from the smoothies?  Ugh. This question again.  I don't have time for this.  Lady, if you're in such a hurry,  why not use the street, like a normal person?  Because if I drive that way, I have to make a left  into traffic and it takes forever and it makes me cranky.  This is you not cranky? No thanky.  But if I go this way, it's easy, and I can get lost  in my CD of New Age Celtic pop, and begin my day.  But I can't do that if kids are blocking the alley.  So  All done, drive through.  Yeah. So sorry to keep you waiting.  Thank you, tricycle girl.  You're welcome, weird business truck lady.  Starting my day now, bye.  Ancient fountains   -  Ooh  - Yeah! Get that Enya in ya.  What a piece of work.  She's not gonna ruin our fun, though, right?  Bean can from downtown.  Should've gone in.  Bob's Burgers.  Oh, hi. Whoa, whoa, whoa, sweetie, hold on.  Slow down, you're talking crazy, honey.  - Oh, is it your sister? - Bob says hi.  O-Okay, okay, just sit tight.  - I'm coming over. - What's wrong?  It's Gayle's first day at her new job at the art museum,  - and she's gonna quit. - That's her thing, right?  She gets a job and threatens to quit after one day.  You know what? You're right. Maybe this time,  I should just let her figure it out for herself.  You're grabbing your keys,  and you're picking up your purse.  I got to go, I got to go.  Gayle, sweetie, I'm here.  Oh, thank God. Hold me up.  I've been standing so long.  Gayle, G-Gayle.  I can't be a security guard, Linda.  Gayle, stand up.  I can't feel my legs.  Here, here, you're standing up, you're standing.  I got to quit, Linda.  I'm not made for this.  I'm not an athlete.  Gayle, look at that guy.  - Yeah? - He's, like, a hundred years old.  If he can do it, you could do it.  I'll never be that good.  Listen, you'll get used to it. I stand all day.  Now I've got the best calves in the family, besides Gene.  It's not just the standing, Linda.  I thought I was gonna be a protector of art.  Guarding it from art thieves, and people who lick sculptures.  People lick sculptures?  Of course they do. Grow up, Linda.  Oh. I-I What the hell is wrong with this world?  But look around. It's boring here.  Gayle, give it another day.  And if you still hate it after that day,  you give it another day.  And you keep going like that. Forever.  - That's what working is. - Linda, no!  But it's not all bad.  They pay you, and you get to go home after  and say, ""What a day,"" and drink.  - That does sound nice. - Thatta girl.  - Now stand in the place where you work. - Okay.  And then, she just drove away.  What's her problem? She doesn't own the alley.  Yeah, kids play in alleys, right? I did.  I was a real Alley Sally till I met your father, settled down.  I hate when people cut through the alley.  E-Except for that guy in the Corvette. He's cool.  I think we'd be friends if we had the opportunity.  She called me ""tricycle girl.""  What's up with that?  Jealous, probably.  Yeah, probably. Hey, uh,  speaking of your, uh, big wheel  Mean green machine.  Right, mean green machine.  Maybe it's time for another, um, you know.  - What? - Another go at the old two-wheeler?  I could give you a lesson again.  No offense, Dad, but the last one didn't go so great.  Louise, tell me when you want me to let go.  - Not yet. - Okay, now. Let go now.  I'm trying. Your hands are on top of my hands.  - Now, Dad! - Louise, relax your grip.  - Let go now! - You're digging your nails in!  Louise, honey, let me teach you.  Your dad's nice, but uh, you know, he's not so bright.  Hey, I'm good at it. I-I taught Tina.  - Ha! - What?  I taught Tina.  I worked with her for a week.  And you swooped in at the end to give her her last push.  I ""swooped in""?  - Like a pterodactyl. - Hairy-dactyl.  Hey, with me, the proof is in the pudding.  Don't forget, I taught Gene.  AKA the pudding.  Actually, I taught Gene.  Mom kept running off to answer the phone.  That woman never says no to a phone call.  It was Ginger. She was going through something.  I'm not allowed to say what, but it rhymes  with ""botched schmemorrhoid surgery.""  Hey, I helped teach Gene, too, remember?  I remember.  - I remember the crying. - The crying?  Your dad usually cries when he teaches bike riding.  Well, yeah, because a beautiful moment is about to happen.  A kid's first ride.  - Oh, boy. - Here it comes.  Guys, I appreciate what you're trying to do here,  but I could ride a bike.  I choose not to.  Three wheels are better than two. It's math.  Well, what do we do to put off doing the dishes?  - Parcheesi? - Cheese party?  Parcheesi cheese party.  Wow, that actually sounds great.  But, before that, Gene and Tina and I were gonna  do a thing real quick? R-Remember?  - Um, sure. - Yes?  Well, be quick. We got your father all excited.  I'll get the Parcheesi board.  Uh, Lin, you get the cheese board.  W-Wait, let's switch.  - Where are we going, Louise? - And am I dressed for it?  Is this a missed scarf-ortunity?  Remember our friend Alice?  She parks right here, so I'm thinking,  we write something in the dust on her back window.  And by ""we,"" I mean ""you,"" 'cause I can't reach.  - What are we gonna write? - Glad you asked.  ""If You Can Read This, You're Behind A Stinky Turd Truck.""  - Huh. - Oh.  Yeah. Pretty good, right?  It's kind of rough?  - Why don't we, um, tweak it a little? - Okay.  ""If you can read this, you're behind  ""what might be a stinky turd truck.  Anyway, have a nice day. Smiley face, one love.""  - It's perfect. - Good collab, guys.  I got to meet some kids who know more curse words.  Louise, we're not gonna start something  when the lady comes through, right?  Nah. We've sent a message.  A weird, wordy message.  I'm glad ""one love"" stayed in.  You guys were gunning for it.  Look, here she comes.  - I'm so nervous. - Relax.  She doesn't know we did it.  I know what you kids did.  - Uh-oh. - Lady, drive on by,  we don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, you do, tricycle girl.  Okay, enough with the tricycle stuff.  Why don't you want to talk about it?  Because you're too old to be riding one?  - Okay. - Whoa.  That's right, I went there, with a child.  And now, I'm so upset, I don't even want this smoothie  I worked so hard on.  What the hell just happened?  I didn't mean to do that, but let's call it a happy accident.  This is an active alley.  It is not for little kids on bikes.  Whispering birds on a tree stump   Still feel good about the ""one love,"" Gene?  Yes, I do.  Fire escape, huh? Whatcha doing? Escaping fires?  We have to hit back at Alice, and hit hard.  Because of what she said about your green machine?  This isn't about my green machine, Tina.  But we can all agree, nine is not too old.  It's single digits.  It's a six upside down; how is that too old?  Sure, s-sure.  This is about our God-given alley access.  Oh, and not getting smoothie splashed on us.  Subpar smoothie.  Bananas and beets are not friends.  But what can we do? We're just three kids,  and she's a mean woman with a big truck.  Right. But what if we weren't just three kids?  Come back in 20 years?  I am loving this plan.  Rudy, buddy.  We're, uh, planning a bike party in our alley.  Do you still have those ramps you built with your dad?  Huh, smaller than advertised, but not bad.  Lot of good memories in these ramps, huh, buddy?  You and I, hammering away at them  - in the driveway of my condo. - Mm-hmm.  Always something fun happening at Dad's, huh?  - Right, son? Right, son? - Ow. Don't do that.  - We don't do that. - Sorry, yeah. Sorry.  So how many people did you invite  to this bike party, Louise?  A few. Everyone.  It doesn't matter.  If you have ramps, kids will come.  Yeah, not in my experience, but okay.  What's Louise doing in the alley?  Setting up for a bike party.  Huh. I didn't get invited.  And I'm the two-wheel teaching master.  What about me? I'm a good teacher.  I taught you all the difference  between Dermot McDermott and Dylan Mulroney.  Dammit. Oh, ugh.  Bob's Burgers.  - Hi, Linda. - Hi, Gayle. How's work?  Terrible. So boring. I got to quit.  Gayle, any good protector of art  knows the threats don't always jump out at you.  - I don't know. - Look around, Gayle.  - What do you see? - A statue.  Oh, wait, that's a lady. She's wearing all white.  - Oh. - Oh, no, wait, it's a statue.  - Oh, no, she moved. - Oh.  Do statues move?  Gayle, Gayle, what else? What else, honey?  Well, there's a guy in the next gallery.  He comes here every day and stares at this one painting.  Every day?  Gayle, you think nothing happens there.  You're wrong. That guy?  He's, uh, casing the joint. He wants that painting.  - What?! - What's he look like? Describe him.  Good-looking, but not too good-looking.  Like the Planters Peanut.  Sounds like he doesn't want to draw attention to himself.  He's that good. You got to watch him.  You might just stop the biggest art heist in history.  You think so?  I know so. Now, I'm gonna check back in with you  at the end of your shift. I want a full report.  Okay. Call me every ten minutes.  No, at the end of your Oh, Gayle, Gayle, I got to go.  You hear that? That's why I'm the world's greatest sister.  Oh, they all left.  - Wow, Louise, nice turnout. - I'm pretty happy with it.  Well, I guess I got to go back inside.  I'm-I'm getting a little weepy  just being around all these bikes.  Yeah, go inside, Dad.  That's not really the vibe we're going for.  Okay, I'd say be careful on the ramps,  but those are some very small ramps.  Yeah, don't let Rudy hear you say that.  Here goes everything.  They should serve a meal on that flight.  So you call this thing a ""boy basket""?  Also known as a ""man-sket.""  And Zeke, if you're thinking about getting one, do it.  I got my wax lips in here, extra socks,  a free yoga magazine I found, prednisone.  I could give my turtle a ride.  You have a turtle?  You've met Terry, like, a thousand times, Zeke.  Oh, Terry.  Right, I met him.  See that, Tina? That is a woman  who's about to take a left into traffic.  Huh. Yeah, she's not even trying to come down the alley.  It's called defeat.  And she wears it like a splattered smoothie.  - Po Po. - Oh, crap.  Hey, is everything okay over there, Louise?  Hang back, Rudy. I'll handle this.  Oh, boy  Having a bike party?  Yeah, Officer, just some wholesome summer fun.  Well, uh, we got an anonymous complaint  from, uh, actually, that lady right there,  that you're blocking the alley.  Yeah, we need you to disperse.  We'll move. Right, Louise?  'Cause the police are saying to.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right away.  Ugh  This is gonna be hard to break  this to the little guy.  It meant so much to him.  What little guy? You're all little guys.  That one. This is kind of, um, a benefit for him.  Oh, yeah, I have a cousin like that.  He's not asthmatic, he's just like that.  Yeah, we set up some ramps, passed the hat.  I wish we could do more.  Can't you do it somewhere else?  We could. It's just he likes the alley.  It's more private here. People don't, you know, stare at him.  - What's going on, Louise? - Ah Oh, God.  Rudy, buddy, I've got some bad news.  Hey, you know what? Never mind that.  We, uh, w-we'll block off the alley.  - Yeah, yeah. - Good luck, kid.  Why are you saying good luck? Why did he say, ""Oh, God""?  Hey, we're here for you, son, the whole damn police force.  Um why?  Ah Look at that face.  - And your shriveled-up little arms. - Yeah.  What's happening? Should I be insulted?  Can we still ride bikes?  Of course you can, just like a normal kid,  just like a normal kid.  Thanks for your help, officers. You did a good thing today.  - I'm a normal kid. I He's - Yeah, yeah.  - You're real normal, Rudy. Right, officers? - Am I not, like, a normal kid?  That's right.  God, I'm so cranky! Getting crankier!  Check and mate.  Yup. She's really having trouble with that left.  Mess with the Belchers and you will be mildly inconvenienced.  You kids are quiet tonight.  I can actually hear the show we're watching.  It's called Mr. Robot, but he's human?  I don't get it. Pass the nuts.  Guys, this is a silence that falls over  a just and peaceful land.  - Who's Justin Peaceful? - I think he's a folk singer.  Oh, must be Rudy.  Him and his dad were gonna come pick up the ramps.  Thanks for holding on to 'em, Louise.  That's weird. I left them right here by the back door.  - Oh, crap. - Wh-What? What, oh, crap?  She took the ramps.  What? We've been ramp-jacked?  I knew we should've insured them.  Who would do a thing like that? Maybe rollerbladers.  - Those guys are pretty tough. - Someone else.  Someone who just took a left turn into a world of hurt.  Oh, no.  So, you wanted my ramps  to get back at a lady who was mean to you,  - and now that lady has them? - Maybe you shouldn't have  left the ramps in the alley, Louise.  Yeah, there's only five things thieves are looking for:  cash, jewelry, swords, velor and ramps.  I didn't think about it, okay? But don't worry, Rudy.  We're gonna march over and take what's yours.  She doesn't have your ramps. The garbage men took 'em.  - What? - I tried to stop 'em.  I was calling, ""Hey! Don't take the ramps!  Don't take the ramps!""  But I had a toothbrush in my mouth then,  and it probably sounded like,  ""Mwah, mwah, moo, moo, moo, moo, mwah!""  But I put the ramps over there.  They were nowhere near the garbage.  - Well, she moved 'em. - What?  That lady you guys are fighting with,  she moved 'em by the Dumpsters.  Ugh. She must've known they'd get taken.  I didn't know why she was moving 'em.  I mean, she was laughing like a crazy person saying,  ""That'll show 'em!""  You know, maybe that should've tipped me off.  It's okay, Mr. Huggins.  It's only partially your fault, mostly her fault,  and nobody else's fault.  Well, I mean, you're the one  who left the ramps out here when there's  Rudy, I threw you a benefit.  Bob's Burgers.  Linda. The eagle has landed.  The hawk is in the hamper.  What? Wh-What are you talking about?  - I got the bastard. - You what?  The art thief, I got him in custody.  Gayle, Gayle, where are you?  The interrogation room.  Wha? They have one of those at the art museum?  Mm-hmm. It's also the employee bathroom.  Oh, my God, Gayle, don't do anything.  I'm coming over there. Don't do anything.  Bob, if I'm not back soon,  it's 'cause I'm on the lam with Gayle.  - Okay, sounds good. - Okay, I got to go.  Oh, God. Here she comes.  Move, Little Trikey Me-No-Likey.  Not until you pay back my friend for his surprisingly safe ramps.  Hi, I'm the friend.  Pretty dangerous ramps, actually. Pretty scary.  I said move.  Oh, I am not moving.  I am gonna eat in this alley and sleep in this alley,  and you are never driving through here again  in your whole life, or at least until school starts.  Move. Honk.  No. Honk.  Do it. Honk.  I won't. Honk!  I mean it. Honk.  I don't care! Honk!  What a couple of honkies.  I don't like this, Louise. It's dangerous.  - Tina, it's fine. Honk! - Louise.  Honk infinity.  - She's good. - What if she thinks  she's in park, but she's not,  and she takes her foot off the brake and Ah!  - Sorry, sorry, sorry. - Oh, Tina, come on!  You kids aren't ruining my morning.  Moss and fog, moss and fog   -  Moss and fog.  - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Are you frickin' kidding me?!  Oh, whoa.  Tina, put the pedal to the  However this thing works. Go, just go.  We got to catch up with that truck.  I got eyes on your green machine.  So far it's hanging in there.  - Kind of. - Whoa! Bikes can go so fast.  I mean, how does it even stay up?  We should be wiping out all over the street right now.  Ahh! Okay, now you're getting in my head.  Let's not look at this too closely.  She's turning on Garden Street.  She's heading towards downtown.  Where the young professionals are.  They love smoothies and hair removal.  Let's cut through that alley.  But what if we run into a bunch of kids who don't want us to?  Whoa, irony, Right?  Hold on. It's a tight squeeze.  Guys! There's a board against some trash up ahead.  I think I think I'm gonna have to take it.  Rudy, be care Oh, that's not very scary.  Whoa!  - Did you guys see that? - See what?  - It's okay. God saw. - There she is!  Faster, Tina!  Gayle, it's Linda, let me in.  We got him just in time.  He was about to make a move.  Oh, hi, hi. How are you? You good?  - What's your name, hon? - Neil.  Neil? It's nice to meet you, Neil. I'm Linda.  Are you the good cop or something?  Oh, my God.  Uh, Gayle, sweetie, he's innocent.  You know that, right?  - He is? - Of course he is.  I'm sorry I got you riled up. I was trying to help.  I didn't think you were gonna kidnap a guy.  You should always think I'm gonna kidnap a guy.  I know. You're right. But, you know,  now you got to put him back where you found him.  But he knows too much now.  - We got to get rid of him. - No, Gayle.  - Stop. - Okay, fine.  Sorry, sir.  We're really sorry.  You're not mad, right?  I'm just confused. I mean,  I-I love this place.  I love that painting.  I-I would never hurt it or steal it.  No, of course not.  What's so special about that painting, anyway?  It's just a bunch of lines and colors and splotches.  I'm an artist, so I know the terminology.  Oh, I-I guess you could say it gives me some comfort  ever since my wife died.  Oh, aw.  Did I say ""wife""? I meant ""cat.""  Oh, my God, you poor thing.  H-Hey, I think you two should get some coffee.  - Really? - You do?  Yeah, I do.  A guy who says ""wife"" but means ""cat""?  That's a guy you got to get to know, Gayle.  How about right now? Oh, I have a job. Oh, I want to quit!  Gayle, just meet him at 5:00, for God's sake.  Oh, it's okay, Gayle.  Uh, I'll just hang around until then.  Oh. Maybe I can lean against you.  Oh. You're really gonna lean, huh?  Yeah, this'll work. Let's go guard some art.  There she is.  You followed me?  Yeah, we did.  You dragged my green machine all over town.  I what? Oh, my God.  That is not easy to look at.  It's like something you dance around at Burning Man.  I didn't know it was there.  Understandable.  It's only a big chunk of plastic  you dragged under your truck for, like, two miles.  I could have killed you.  Oh. Huh. Well, I guess that's true.  I like how upset you are.  Keep that coming.  - Okay, too much. - I'm sorry.  Things have been crazy. I've been so on edge  since I dumped my savings into this truck.  It seems like a can't-miss idea, right?  - Um, yeah, uh - Sure, sure.  But business is bad.  Business is very bad.  Well, maybe that's your problem?  It makes me feel awful, you know?  That part of trying something new  when I just suck at it.  What if I suck at it forever?  I don't know. Give up?  No, no, no. It's okay, Alice.  We've all been there. Haven't we?  Sorry, lady. You're not gonna get me  and my messed up green machine to feel bad for you.  I'm just saying, we've all had that fear  when you're trying something new  that's kind of scary  and you think you're never gonna be able to do it, right?  I did when I was switching from boob to bottle.  Hardest four years of my life.  Okay, so we covered Gene. And maybe someone else  can relate in some way?  - I don't like bats. - Okay, that's totally off-topic.  Sorry, I thought we were just talking about scary stuff.  Louise, what have you been scared about lately?  Something that's ""wheel-y"" hard to start doing?  - ""Two-wheel-y"" hard? - I'm gonna also say bats.  Nope, that's not something you do.  Uh, can I guess?  Shut up, Alice. Sorry, sorry.  All right, I get it. I get it, Tina. Geez.  Oh, good.  And maybe you have a point.  Alice, I can see how you might not have been  your best self during our alley interactions.  Thank you. And I just want to say  I also don't like bats.  Hard thing to admit. Respect.  You know what?  I am gonna stick with this business.  Good one. Oh, you're serious.  I mean, good. Solid plan.  And I want to pay you back for the ramps and the trike  - Great. -  in store credit!  - Would you prefer waxes or smoothies? - Smoothies.  - Smoothies. - Smoothies. - Waxes!  Sorry again about your ramps, Rudy.  It's okay.  My dad and I will build more ramps.  From the ashes rise ramps.  - More ramps. - Huh.  Is there something different about Jimmy Jr. and Zeke?  Check it out, Gene. Our man-skets.  How'd I ever get by without one of these?  Yeah! Summer of the boy basket.  And what about your green machine, Louise? I mean,  free smoothies take some of the sting out of it, but  Yeah. Well, I've been thinking  Move back. Everyone move back.  We're back as far as we can go, Louise.  Move back further. Mom, no pictures.  Right, right, right. Mr. Huggins, you got this?  I got it.  Mom, who are you taking to? What'd you just say?  Nothing, nobody.  Just focus on the bike and smile.  Here we go in five, four  - Dad, no crying! - I'm sorry.  Don't worry, Louise. If your father screws this up,  I'm ready to step in and be the hero.  For the record, I totally paved the way  for this whole thing to happen  with my amazing speech earlier.  But yeah, it's fine.  Three, two, one  Oh!  Pedal! Pedal! You're becoming a woman, Louise!  Okay, Dad, let go.  Wait, not yet! Okay, now!  Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone   When the morning comes   Oh, when the night is over   Like a bat out of hell   I'll be gone, gone, gone   Like a bat out of hell   I'll be gone when the morning comes   But when the day is done and the sun goes down   And the moonlight's shining through   Then like a sinner   Before the gates of heaven   I'll come crawling on back"
"1  Here she comes. It's go time.  One, two, three.  Happy Mother's Day!  - Aw. - We made you a card.  It has a picture of you giving birth to all of us,  and you're saying, ""Ow-chi-wah-wah!""  Ooh. It's so graphic, but I love it.  Happy Mother's Day, Lin. I snuck out early this morning  and bought bacon and eggs and berries,  and I was gonna make a special Mother's Day breakfast.  But I didn't get started yet 'cause I went to the bathroom,  and it took, um, it took a long time.  Aw, that's really sweet, but I've actually got  a little Mother's Day idea. (clears throat)  Today, all of you have to say yes to me, no matter what,  because on this Mother's Day, I am all-powerful,  I am mom-nipotent!  That's hot. I like a mom who takes control.  What if you snap and ask us to murder somebody?  You'd have to do it, 'cause it's Mother's Day.  - LOUISE: Hmm. - Okay, Your Momnipotency,  uh, what do you want to do today?  Well, Ginger was telling me about the open houses  on Kingshead Island.  Not only do you get to walk through  beautiful homes for sale,  apparently, the realtors put out amazing finger food.  - Go on. - It's all free.  We'll act rich, we'll take the tours, and we'll eat our way  - around Kingshead Island. - (sighs) I-I don't know.  And you have to say yes 'cause it's Mother's Day,  and I'm mom-nipotent.  Isn't it wrong to pretend we're buying a house  to eat free food that isn't for us?  Don't worry, these richy riches can afford to feed us.  Oh, but before we leave, all of you have to bathe,  'cause you all look a little gross.  But I love you. Happy Mother's Day!  (seagulls chirping)  So, uh, none of you wanted to dress up  to do the whole rich family thing?  - I changed my walk. Look. - Damn.  Uh, well, I'm gonna go buy a snack.  - Watch my walk. - Oh, he looks so tired.  - Hmm. Kind of hard to open, huh? - Lot of plastic wrap.  It's like they don't want us to get to the muffin.  - But we're gonna, aren't we? - Yeah. Yeah, we are, eventually.  Are you going to Kingshead Island?  Yeah. I'm going to my mother's house.  - Do you live on Kingshead? - Oh, God, no. We're poor.  We're just gonna go for the day to check out open houses.  Wait, if y-you're poor, why are you going to open houses?  Oh, 'cause my wife is forcing us  to go and eat the free food they give out.  - Oh, so you mean lie. - No, we're-we're just gonna  pretend to be people that are different from  Yeah, lie, lie.  - We're gonna lie. - (gasps) Hey, I did it!  Ugh, I feel like I'm still 20 minutes away, but  You'll get there.  LINDA: Okay, remember:  we're very rich, we're here to buy a house,  so when we get in there, don't go right for the food.  Just play it cool.  Oh, my God, look at that spread!  - Lin, calm down. - Look at it!  - Lin. - Okay, you're right.  I'll calm down. I'm just gonna touch a shrimp.  Oh, they're real.  Wow, they have a downstairs that's not a restaurant.  Tina, get in character.  So, now we've seen the guest house.  Where's the main house? Oh. (chuckles)  This is the main house?  (laughs): Oh, why, it's so cute.  I think we should buy it as a vacation home for my ferrets.  Oh, okay, kids, go upstairs, and, uh,  you pick out your rooms.  - I call dibs on the biggest one! - Hell no! I'm the oldest!  - LOUISE: Oh! - (panting)  LOUISE: My room has its own bathroom!  - GENE: Mine, too! - TINA: So does mine!  LOUISE: Mine has a huge shower!  TINA: Mine just has a sink and a toilet.  - A half bath? - You disgust me!  You know what's weird? I think you might be  - a little overdressed. - Yeah, I know.  All the rich ladies are wearing yoga pants.  Well, at least I'm doing a great job  acting like I'm not here for the free food.  Look how casual I am when I eat this shrimp.  (moans)  Lin, you're moaning when you chew.  It's shrimp, Bob.  (moaning)  - Hi. - Oh, God.  - That's my wife. She's - Oh, ooh, one more.  - One more. (exhales) - She's eating shrimp.  Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp and houses   Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp and houses   Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp and houses   Open house, open house, open houses   Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp and houses   Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp and houses   Shrimp and houses!   Ah, I'm limp from shrimp.  Well, this is it, the last house.  We're being watched. Realtor at three o'clock.  - That guy? - No, that's nine o'clock.  - That guy? - No, that's Gene.  - 'Sup, girl? - Uh, okay.  Uh, kids, go pick out your rooms.  As you wish, Mother.  Cute kids. Happy Mother's Day.  Aw, thank you.  I'm Julia. This is my listing. Chocolate covered strawberry?  Okay, I might have one. Or four. (laughs)  I love your dress.  Some of these other ladies should take a lesson from you.  I know, right? Yoga pants to an open house?  - Come on. - (laughs)  They just come to snoop around and eat the free food.  - Can you believe that? - What?!  Ooh, clogs! Let me guess. Are you a chef?  Do you have a restaurant?  - (chuckles) I-I do. - Which one?  Uh, it's, uh, a little, out of the way bistro  that serves f uh, food.  Mmm, that sounds good.  Can I say something that might seem a little out of bounds?  Uh, sure.  I don't know if you belong here.  Uh, what-what do you mean?  I think you're too interesting for this house.  (laughs): Yeah.  Oh, you're right, we are.  I just got a new listing. It could be a good fit for you.  I can get you into a private showing right now.  - Oh, no, that's okay. We got to go. - I'm listening.  It's a Victorian mansion. Old school Kingshead.  - Ooh. - Lin.  - Lots of character. - Character.  I should tell you, it does have some ""old house"" issues.  - Old house issues. - Oh, my God.  Lin, uh, quick talk, please, uh, right now.  A private showing is very different  from an open house, Lin. Plus, I don't think  we should waste this realtor's time.  What? She makes a ton of money doing this stuff.  Look, I'm mom-nipotent, so say yes.  - (sighs) Yes. - All right!  Let's go buy Mama a new house!  Thanks for the ride. We don't have our car.  We took the boat here.  Oh, you don't live on Kingshead?  I mean, our boat. Uh, we took our boat here,  from our island Uh, we have a little island.  - It's nothing. - Wow. Here we are.  Okay, let me just clear some stuff out of the backseat.  (grunting) Just this oh, God!  These things are a pain to get out. (chuckles)  - (shouts) - Oh, you're a mom.  Uh, happy Mother's Day.  Thanks. Yeah, I'm only 12 weeks  into being a mom, but I'm loving it.  I'm also not sleeping, my boobs hurt,  - and I'm up to my neck in poop. - Been there.  Well, hop in. Let's go check out your new home.  So, uh, how long you been selling houses for?  Well, these are my first two listings.  We got pregnant, and I decided it was time for a career change.  And if I don't go broke buying all that food  for the open houses, it'll be worth it.  Oh, my goodness.  Ooh, gas station. Do you mind, real quick?  I've been running on empty.  Be right back.  Oh, my God, Lin, we-we can't go to this house.  We need to leave, now.  I'm really uncomfortable with this situation.  - And with Gene on my lap. - You love it.  LOUISE: I've got Dad on my lap.  Oh, sorry. There you are.  This is awful. She's so sweet and normal  and a new mom, and it's Mother's Day.  Lin, let's just tell her something came up,  and we'll take a cab to the ferry.  - Yeah, yeah. Let's do that. - Okay, I put in three bucks.  That should get us there.  Uh, hey, Julia, so something, uh  You know, I actually thought I might lose this listing  'cause I only found one couple to come look at the house.  But now that I'm bringing you,  I think everything is gonna be okay.  Oh, uh, well, let's go see this house already, huh?  (Tina groaning)  JULIA: All right, so the owner is also here.  I called him before we left. This was his mom's house,  and he really wants to sell it to a nice family, like you guys.  Okay, let's just go in, take the tour, and leave.  Doesn't feel good lying to her, but at least we won't get caught.  Learning some strong lessons from you today, Mom.  Look, we shouldn't be doing this,  and your mom has made some bad judgments today,  but it-it'll be fine.  Nobody knows we're poor people who came over on the ferry.  - Oh. Um hi. - Oh, my God.  Um, h-hello.  Spencer, this is Bob, Linda and their kids.  Hi, Linda, kids, Bob.  Spencer, so I, uh, I feel like, uh  Bob, let me stop you right there and say,  it's nice to meet you, for the first time.  I-I agree. I-It's also nice to meet you.  - For the first time, as well. - Huh?  Oh. You guys are good at talking.  Shall we go inside?  What the hell is going on? You sound weird.  You're gonna get us caught.  Lin, I-I have something to tell you.  I met Spencer on the boat. I told him everything.  He knows what we're doing today.  - He knows we're faking. - What?!  JULIA: Linda, come inside! There's a whole house in here!  Told you it had character. I've got to show you the library.  My Mom loves to read.  - Mom, name two books. - Shush.  - Mom, can we go pick out our rooms? - Uh  You may absolutely pick out any room on the second floor.  But I'd like to ask that you do not,  and I repeat, do not go up to the third floor.  Okay, that was just a little scary the way you said that.  It's just, I'm remodeling the third floor.  It isn't safe.  O-Okay, kids? You got that? No third floor.  Come, come. Let's have a look-see.  And maybe a purchase-y.  What's going on?  Why didn't you want Julia to know we met?  And why aren't you kicking us out of your house?  Oh, you mean because you're faking being rich,  going around, looking at houses, wasting everybody's time?  - Yes? - Because I realized  - I could actually use your help. - Wait, what?  There's another couple coming to look at the house.  They've been sniffing at this listing for months.  And what they need is a little competition  to get them to make an offer.  And Julia doesn't need to know you're lying liars.  She seems like a good person.  - Unlike you, Bob. - Fair enough.  But we're not really able to buy a house?  Just keep doing what you're doing.  - Help me unwrap this muffin. - I never got mine unwrapped.  But-but I know what you're saying.  - I smoked you fools! - (panting) Damn it.  (panting) I am so full of cruditÃ©s!  TINA: Oh, mine has a swing!  LOUISE: Mine has a bathtub in the middle of the room!  GENE: Mine has a swing in the bathtub!  I don't know if it's a sex thing or a disabled thing.  Either way, it works!  OLD WOMAN: Leave!  - Did you guys hear that? - I hope not.  I hope so.  OLD WOMAN (growling): Leave now!  - (Gene and Tina scream) - Whoa.  It's a ghost. This house is haunted!  (slow footsteps)  Wait, were those feet? Ghosts don't have feet.  I think we should go up there and check it out.  You mean up to the third floor?  - It's off-limits. - I know.  And I feel really bad about that, but we're going.  I can't believe my last meal was cruditÃ©s!  I can see this house is winning you over!  Do you think you're getting close to making an offer?  Do you want to call your bank? Is that crazy?  Uh, no, it's, uh, it's not, uh, crazy.  Uh, I can call them right now.  1-800-BANK.  Uh, hi, bank, it's Linda.  Uh, yeah, it's Linda with the money.  Uh, how are interest rates?  Oh, Julia, I can't do this.  I got to tell you something, sweetie.  Hi, Lin, I just want to interrupt real quick  before you say any more words.  Can I talk to you in the hall?  So we keep acting interested in the house,  help push the other people to make an offer,  Julia never finds out we're phonies,  and she gets a commission on the sale and everyone's happy?  Yes. I mean, I don't know about happy,  but that's the plan.  Oh, this is great.  I already had an amazing Mother's Day,  and now it's time to give Julia one.  - We're heroes. - Y Yeah, sure.  It's so murder-y up here.  LOUISE: He's definitely not remodeling.  He's hiding something, something horrible.  - Tina, you go first. - Wait, what?  Well, fine, we'll all go together, but with you in front.  - Okay, that's fair. - Mm-hmm.  (Tina groans)  (door creaks)  TINA: Oh, hell no.  What is this?  Maybe he's just a good dude who opened a medical lab  and is doing important medical research?  (all scream)  Huh. This is incredible.  The squirrels are all wearing little costumes.  ""Professor Nutstein.""  This is terrifying.  I've got a ""Captain Nutstein"" over here.  Look at this one. ""Pope Nutstein.""  Very accomplished family, the Nutsteins.  Leave!  (all scream)  Leave (coughs) Lea  - (coughs) Tea. - What?  (coughs) Tea. Tea. Fetch my tea.  - It's on the table. (coughs) - Here you go.  Damn dust in this house.  Wait, were you saying ""leave"" in a really scary way on purpose  or is that just how you talk?  And are the squirrels part of it?  There's just a lot going on.  Uh, yes, I was trying to be scary.  I was trying to get you to leave.  No, the squirrels aren't part of it.  That's just a thing I do.  Follow-up question: um, who are you?  My name's Ethel. I live here.  Where did you get all these squirrels?  From the house. It's infested with them.  You found all these dead squirrels in your house?  Yes. Let's say I found them all dead, natural causes.  So this is your house?  I thought it was Spencer's house.  This is my house. Spencer's my son.  Aren't you trying to sell it?  Why are you trying to scare us away?  I don't want to sell. Spencer wants to sell.  He's trying to push me out of here.  So every time he shows my house, I try to scare away the buyers.  By pretending to be a ghost?  Mm-hmm. I've been spooking the hell out of this place.  That's badass, Ethel.  I know. I've rigged the whole house.  I cut eye-holes in the paintings and everything.  And I've been saving buckets of squirrel blood  for the right moment.  - (Tina gags) - I've lived here for over 60 years.  I got married in this house. I raised a kid in this house.  - I learned taxidermy in this house. - LOUISE: Yeah, you did.  Eventually Spencer moved away and my husband passed.  It was lonely at first, but this place is still my home.  That is so sad.  Yeah, we thought you guys should hear that.  You're selling your mother's house on Mother's Day?  Okay, so now I know why I got this listing  and why it's been on the market for so long.  Your mother has been haunting all the showings.  Haunting and/or just seeming really freaky.  Oh, okay. So, uh, are we still showing the house?  - Yes. - No.  Yes, we are still showing.  We have been over this, Mom. You are moving in with me.  Okay, good. Uh, Kyle and Claire are gonna be here any minute.  You know what, Julia?  When Kyle and Claire get here, I think it might be good  if you tour everyone around together.  You know what I mean?  Oh, okay. Get a little competition going.  Oh! They're here.  Mom, please can I take you back upstairs?  So I can haunt?  - No. - Freak it?  - No! - Mm.  Okay, you can do this.  You are gonna sell a house today.  Oh, no. Torn between two mothers on Mother's Day.  Mamma Mia.  I can't believe you're selling my house on Mother's Day.  It was the only Sunday we could do this.  I got you that card with the monkey on it  that said, ""I'm bananas for you.""  - Then act like you're bananas for me! -(doorbell rings)  I'll get it! There's an accent I've been wanting to try out.  No, kids, go-go keep Ethel company.  Fine. Team Ethel heading back to the third floor.  I don't know what to do. I want to help Julia get a sale,  but I don't want to be shady to an old lady.  I know. We shouldn't have come here or done any of this.  I just wanted to eat shrimp and feel fancy on Mother's Day.  What are we gonna do?  Look, I think we just have to keep up the act,  try to get this other couple to buy the house,  and then get out of here.  So keep up the act, screw over an old lady,  and try to sleep at night?  I like the way I said it better,  but yeah, that's basically the plan.  Oh, we're going to hell.  Maybe there's another room we could sit in,  because I'm getting a little naus (gags)  - Oh, God. Oh, my God. - Whoa.  Oh, what's the big deal? It's like a Fruit Roll-Up.  - You just ruined Fruit Roll-Ups! - Just let me work.  This might be the last one I make before he sells this place.  Wait, so you're giving up? That's it?  Is Spencer even gonna let you bring all of these to his house?  I'll probably donate them to the children's hospital.  No! Don't you do that to those kids!  I-I mean, cool, cool, v-very cool.  Seems sad if you've been saving  all that squirrel blood for nothing.  - You feel me? - I feel you.  Kyle and Claire have been e-mailing me a lot of questions,  but this is their first time up here.  You've been circling this property for a while,  like hungry wolves that don't ever actually attack.  Oh, we're gonna attack.  We watch the drone video of the property, like, every night.  You know what they say, drone it till you own it. (chuckles)  BOB: Hmm, that's great, Kyle.  That's-that's great that you've seen that video.  I have a computer, too.  My wife called the bank already, so loan it till you own it.  Wait, you're not paying cash?  That's gonna slow things down for you.  Oh, no, I meant I'm, uh,  loaning money to the bank to then pay me.  You're loaning money to the bank?  One of us is kind of embarrassing himself right now.  We rattled them. I think it's already working.  I know. This guy wants to fight me.  (chuckles): I love it.  Ooh, water damage. That wasn't in the photos.  - ""Water"" we gonna do about that? - I love that water damage.  Don't you love it, Lin? Lin, the water damage?  Oh, yeah, it's, uh, great. It's real, uh I love it.  CLAIRE: It's a little gusty out here.  I love a little breeze.  I could come out here and, you know, fly my kite.  I have a gold kite. Do you, Kyle?  Do you have a gold kite? 'Cause I do.  We could get rid of that old swing set, right?  - Bit of an eyesore. - Yeah, it was mine as a kid.  - Poor kid. - Aw, swing set.  I love this room.  It just needs a fresh coat of Kyle and Claire.  Or we blow out this wall, blow out that wall,  and put a fresh coat of Kyle's sword collection right there.  Did you say swords? (laughs)  I-I remember when I used to be into my sword collection.  I-I'm into spears now.  That's my family in squirrel form.  - I meant to hide that. - Aw.  SPENCER: My mother's first squirrel-sterpiece.  - Her word, not mine. -   I think we've seen everything we need to see.  Linda, uh, let's make a move.  It's gonna be a big move into this house.  - Oh. - Babe, I think we pull the trigger.  - Should we just do it? - You think we should do it?  - I want to do it. - I want to do it if you want to do it.  - Cock it? Pull it? - Cock it and pull it.  All right. Let's buy this place.  No, stop! Nobody should buy this house!  - What? - Huh?  I can't do it anymore, Bob.  We're not making an offer, all right?  We're not interested in the house.  We can barely afford our apartment.  Apartment? Gross.  We're only acting interested to get you to make an offer.  We were just trying to help Julia,  but I think we're supposed to be helping Ethel.  Julia, I'm sorry.  Who's Ethel? Did you hire these people?  Wait, are you trying to trick us into buying this house?  No, no. I just met Bob and Linda.  - Kyle high club? - Claire-atin?  Un-cock it, un-pull it. We're going home.  Please don't go. Uh, re-re-cock it.  - Mommy, Daddy, help! - CLAIRE: What is happening?  - Ghost! We saw a ghost! - The damn house is haunted!  ETHEL (growling): Leave!  (kids screaming)  Person blood!  Leave! (groaning)  - Everyone was just leaving. - Oh, good.  (sobs) This would probably be considered  a very bad private showing.  Full disclosure, this is squirrel blood, not human.  Um, but each squirrel only bleeds a few ounces,  so do the math.  So many squirrels!  She peels them like Fruit Roll-Ups!  Julia, I'm so sorry.  I'm just a mother who was looking  to have a nice Mother's Day, and things got out of control.  Oh, cool, got it, thanks. Great explanation.  (groans) My hip is killing me. It must be the weather.  It's not the weather. It's the stairs, Mom.  This house has too many stairs for you.  You're so old.  It's why I want her to move in with me.  Right, right. That makes sense.  - Honey, let's go. - I'm leaving, too.  I'll find a new job.  - Maybe I'll be a spine-o-cologist. - What's that?  (crying): Isn't that what they call spine doctors?  I don't know. I'll find out when I become one.  She's gonna be okay.  Wait, wait, don't go. Let me say something.  Spencer, I-I thought you were being mean to your mom  and you just wanted to sell the house for money,  but-but really you were being sweet.  You were just worried. I get it.  This house has, like, 600 freaking steps,  and you're scared she's gonna fall  and end up looking like how she looks right now,  all bloody and gross.  Yes, I am. I'm scared of a lot of things.  The house catching on fire  because of the exposed wires in the basement  The what?  -  and the lead in the pipes. - Wait, what? - Oh, my God.  You should be worried about the squirrels, bro.  They are gonna rise up and tear that lady apart!  And-and you two, you love this house  and you were about to make an offer on it.  We were, but then you made things super weird  and tried to trick us.  And Spencer just disclosed, like, five other things  - that are total deal breakers. - I was kidding. (giggles)  Look, we did tell a fib,  and-and Spencer did say some stuff,  but that stuff's all fixable, and that fib that we told  got you guys to finally realize  that this is the right house for you.  You're not gonna find another place like this one.  - This house is special. - It is.  I mean, we'd have to change everything, but it is special.  So you don't collect spears?  - Um, I mean, no. - I'm gonna do it, then.  Ethel, listen to me, honey. This place is just a house now.  Your home is with your son.  He wants you to move in with him. He cares about you.  Hmm. Spencer never said it to me quite that way.  He talked a lot about me falling down stairs,  but I could never tell if he was pro or con.  - I've been both. - Oh, fine.  I'll move in with you, Spencey.  Sell the damn house.  Well, I'll let you take it from here, Julia.  So, do you guys want to buy a house?  - We're gonna need 50,000 off. - And then another 50,000 off.  - No. - You got a deal.  Oh, say yes, Spencer. It's a good price.  They don't even know about the sinking.  - The what? - What? -Nothing. Deal.  - Fine. - I just sold a house! I sold a home!  All right! (sighs) I'm exhausted.  I'm starving. Who's hungry?  - Anyone want a Fruit Roll-Up? - (Tina gags)  - I make them myself. - (Tina gags)  - Jerky? - We got to go. We got to go!  LINDA:  Mommies are the best   Mommies are the best, mommies are the best   Moms!   - LINDA:  My mom  - ETHEL:  His mom   -  Your mom  -  Her mom   -  Moms!  -  Moms!   LINDA:  If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy   (vocalizing)  Mommies are the best   Mommies are the best, mommies are the best   Moms!   - LINDA:  My mom  - ETHEL:  His mom   -  Your mom  -  Her mom   LINDA:  I'm mom-nipotent!   - ETHEL:  Happy Mother's Day  - LINDA:  It's my day."
"1  LOUISE: Feast your eyes. My Burobu card collection.  So, Burobu's like PokÃ©mon, but just everybody's a slug?  - Uh, yeah. - Finally.  TINA: Why are there three empty slots?  Because I'm missing three of the nine stages of Slugodactyl.  My favorite slug.  Gah, can you believe this collection's  taken me two and a half years to build?  Buying all these card packs, making all these trades  Nerd. I-I mean wow.  Yeah, well, guess what. Now I have a new plan.  - Get another hobby? - No.  I'm gonna speed things up with these less-than-authentic  Burobu cards I found online.  TINA: - Are they blurry?  Only if you look at them.  Here's the thing, these are all Mega Ultra.  When I trade with these, mama gets what mama wants.  Mega Ultra Macho Slugmarine. Brag.  Don't touch it too hard. The ink's not the kind that dries.  So, I'm gonna take a few of these to school Monday,  make some trades, get those last three Slugodactyls,  and my empire will be complete.  ALL: Yay!  Wait, didn't you say those cards got banned from school?  Yeah, we got a little out of control.  Stop it.  Put 'em away.  KIDS: I pledge allegiance to the flag  Son of a All right, you punks, that's it.  Those cards are banned.  If I see 'em again, it's detention  and I'm confiscating them. Now apologize to America.  But relax, we're not doing the trades until after school.  So there's my plan. Feedback? Praise? Yes, Tina.  It seems sort of dishonest.  I mean, those cards are fake, right?  Oh, I don't like the ""F"" word.  I prefer non-official, non-approved, m'kay? Uh, Tina.  Now can we talk about our study buddy time together tomorrow?  I have some ideas.  - Let's try to keep it on Burobu for now, huh? Okay? - Okay.  - That's what we're doing in my room right now. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  - Okay. - Okay. Uh, yes, Gene.  Did John Lithgow play John Larroquette in a movie,  or was that just a dream?  - Oh, that's a good one. Uh - Yeah.  I thought you were only doing Burobu questions.  - I know, but that's interesting. - LINDA: Kids! Dinner!  What were you kids doing?  Well, Louise is really excited about her Burobu cards,  but what some people think is more exciting  is we're gonna be study buddies tomorrow.  - Oh, yeah. - Uh, what are you two gonna be studying?  We're supposed to help them with homework  from the class they just had. So, math.  Oh, boy. - Oh, God. -What?  It's just, Tina, when it comes to math, you  - are bad at it. - Have room for improvement?  Don't worry. I think I've found someone to help.  Oh, look, she's here now.  'Sup? I'm Mathy Cathy from the mean streets of Fraction Town.  Sure, math is tough, but so am I.  - Hmm. - Damn!  I already feel like I know more math.  - (phone ringing) - Hello.  Listen, kid. Sometimes on the streets,  - stuff doesn't add up. - Yup.  - Things can get negative. - Yup. Yup.  (sighs) Okay, fine. B Uh, bye.  What was that about?  Harry, the pickle guy we used to go to he died.  (gasp) Oh, no! Poor Harry and his pickles.  That was his lawyer on the phone.  Apparently, in his will,  Harry requested that I speak at the funeral.  - Oh, no. - Yeah.  He must have forgotten to take me out of his will after  The incident.  - Okay. Don't say ""the incident"" like that. - Wha ?  Whoa, whoa, wait, what incident?  Which one of us is the pickle man's child?  I don't want to talk about it.  Dad, would you be more comfortable telling  Mathy Cathy? 'Cause, man, I've seen some stuff.  Thank you, Cathy, but no.  LABONZ: Okay, students,  Mr. Ambrose is gonna watch you during study buddy time  while I go outside to not smoke several cigarettes.  Okay, do your math or whatever. I don't know.  You're never gonna use it. I never use it.  All right, tiny Andy,  you want to get into some fraction action?  Half of me does.  Zeke, do you want to draw stuff on my arm?  Oh, man! Dang, do I ever! Come on.  - Ow. Not with your pencil! - Give me that arm. Give it to me!  - Ow! Zeke, that hurts! - Come on. Give it to me! Come on.  Two-thirds plus four-fifths.  The age-old question, huh, Tammy?  - Ooh No, thanks. - Okay.  Jocelyn, braid my hair.  Okay. Which one?  Hey, Louise, your sister told me  you had a beef with some homework.  Whoops. Little mishap.  Okay, Louise, two hours till school's over.  Then you can trade. You can make it.  (strained): You can make it.  No, you can't.  Hey, Rudy, Large Tommy, Andy, Ollie.  You know how we were gonna do that  Burobu trade sesh after school?  - Yup. - Yeah. -Big time.  What if we go back behind that shelf  and do it right now?  No way. We'll get detention and the cards will be confiscated.  - Yeah, they'll get constipated. - No.  Rudy, come on.  Wow. That's a powerful argument. Yeah, okay, I'm in.  Whew, I'm back. Now let's open up a can of whoop-ass  on these fractions, huh, kid?  Actually, you'd, uh, really be helping old Cathy out  if you read aloud the problems.  So, Tina, Cathy, whatever, look.  We're gonna hit the back corner for a quick Burobu moment,  and I need you to be on the lookout.  What? Now? No, we'll get in trouble.  Tina, I'm over here.  Oh. What? Now? No, we'll get in trouble.  Come on, Tina. Get my back.  Mathy Cathy would be down with it, right?  - Yeah. She's always down. - Yeah.  Okay, so if anyone comes, just make a loud fart noise  with your face or your butt or whatever feels right.  Let's go. Come on.  So we're just gonna go read something from a book.  Seems like a waste of time, but, sure, go nuts.  What do I care? I'd rather go home.  - I don't know what I'm doing. - (nervous groan)  MORT: So, Bob, you gonna be ready  for Harry's service at my place Tuesday night?  Why is it at night, anyway?  I think Harry wanted all the other farmers market people  to be able to go, after they finish packing  their unsold rhubarb.  Ugh. All the farmer people are gonna be there.  Right! They all saw the incident.  - Lin, stop. - Incident.  - Wh-What incident? - (sighs) Okay, fine. I'll tell you.  I bought from Harry for about ten years.  We were friends, farmers market friends.  And then one day,  I said maybe his latest bath of sweet pickles  was a little too sweet, and he didn't take it well.  He started throwing pickles at me, and I retaliated.  I picked up a pickle and I threw it  at that 80-year-old man's face.  Oh, my God. Is that how he died?  No, Teddy, that was four years ago.  He just died recently, remember?  Oh, right. Probably didn't help, though, huh?  It's true.  Andy and Ollie, I think you'll be very happy  with this Mega Ultra Slugerantula.  I'm gonna rub it on my belly to get my scent on it.  Me, too. Then we'll be its mom.  Uh, hey, not so much rubbing, okay? Enjoy.  Why do these smell like gasoline?  Oh, that's, uh, a new thing.  - Oh, interesting. - Yeah.  (door opens)  Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.  - Hey there. - Oh, God, no.  So, I just wanted to, uh, super casually ask you  if you'd heard anything about some faculty folks  getting together for a Martini Tuesday kind of thing?  - Oh, Martuesdays? Nope. Sorry. - I Oh. Oh. Because  Oh, my God. This cart of books  -has to be anywhere else right now. - Nuts.  Oh, thank God.  - Ah! Okay. (weak fart noise) - What the ?  Eighth graders, where are all the fourth graders?  They're living their lives.  - Tina? Tina? - (weak fart noises)  - Where are your study buddies? - Uh  Okay, Louise, I guess you've got a deal.  Yes! All nine Slugodactyls are mine.  - Got you! - (kids gasp)  I'm taking those cards. Thanks for telling me, Tina.  (growls)  Oh, crap.  Wow, I've never been back here. Ugh, it's just more books.  Well Louise knew if she brought the Burobu cards to school,  she'd get detention and they'd get confiscated  and she shouldn't have put Tina in that position.  Yes. Right.  Yeah, no, true, but then Tina ratted on her.  You never go against the family.  - Never. - Easy, Don Corleone.  - You mean Don Pepperoni? - You don't understand!  Ms. Labonz made me talk.  Where are they?  - Where are your study buddies? - Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!  - Where are they? - Uh! Uh!  - Hmm. - Mmm  O-Okay, that might be slightly exaggerated.  (growls)  (glass squeaking)  (whispering): I'm so glad I'm not Tina.  (whispering): Yeah, me, too.  (sighs)  Louise, listen.  I'm sorry about what happened, but  LOUISE: Oh, can it! You knew how much those cards meant to me,  and you ratted anyway!  You went against the family, Tina.  Why does everyone keep saying that?  Because you're a scaredy-butt banana rat!  I think I follow, but what's the banana part about?!  - 'Cause you're yella! - Okay, got it!  So I'm guessing you two have worked things out?  Gene, you're gonna have to choose: Tina or me?  I lost one sister today. Am I gonna lose another?  Aah! I won't take sides! I'm like a sexy Switzerland.  Fine. Then you're both dead to me.  Hmm. Looks like we're sleeping on the couch.  So, how's your speech for Harry coming, Bob?  Yeah, did you work in the part  where you hit him in the face with a pickle?  No, Teddy. I was gonna talk about safe stuff.  Like, all his stories about dill.  And you think that's gonna fly?  Yeah, Bob, there's gonna be a room  full of judgmental farmers watching you.  Not to mention Harry,  looking down on you with his deformed face.  I didn't deform his face. It always looked weird.  You know what you should do, throw in some jokes. You know?  - Pickle jokes. - Ooh! What if you said something like,  ""I'm glad everyone could 'cu-come-ber' to the service.""  No.  How about this? ""I relish the opportunity to speak here today.""  - Mm-mm. - You should sing ""Danny Boy,""  but replace the word ""pipes"" with ""pickles,"" you know?  - Oh, my God. - Eh  And off Labonz goes to Tuesday cafeteria duty,  right on schedule.  Now, Rudy, all you got to do is stand watch  while I pick the lock on her desk and get our cards back.  I don't feel comfortable with this.  Well, you sound ready to go. Come on.  Ah, wait! (inhales) There she is.  - Hi, Ms. Labonz. Uh, may we join you? - Eh?  What's going on?  Are you two pulling a Clueless  and trying to set me up with another teacher?  Not interested. I like firemen, a lot.  A-Actually, Ms. Labonz, I-I just wanted to ask you  if you could return the Burobu cards to the fourth graders?  No way. Not gonna happen.  I'm hearing no with a hint of yes?  No! You know where those cards are?  In the bureau by my front door in the drawer  where I keep the baggies I use to pick up the crap  my neighbor's stupid dog, Spritzel,  leaves in my front yard, so when I run out of bags,  I'm gonna use the cards.  Okay. Well, that paints a picture.  I looked everywhere nothing.  Maybe she stashed them in the teacher's lounge.  Come on, let's move.  Sneak into the teacher's lounge? Oh, no, I need to sit down.  Oh, Rudy, God.  Where's my inhaler? Where's my inhaler?  - It's right You're holding it. - (wheezing): Oh, my God.  LOUISE: Where are they?  AMBROSE: Oh yeah, Labonz is definitely in for tonight.  Martini Tuesdays are the only reason  - she's still a teacher. - Oh! Oh!  And my roommate Joyce will be  at her dumb kidney donation thingy,  so we can be as rowdy as we want.  - What about Frond? - Yeah, does he know?  Ugh, why does that buzzkill want to come, anyway?  He doesn't even drink, which is amazing  since he has so many reasons to.  - (laughing) - (Rudy inhales)  BRANCA: Did you hear that?  - Ugh, Branca, again? - It wasn't me.  LINDA: Okay, we're leaving.  Wish your father good luck with his Harry pickle eulogy.  BOTH: Good luck with your Harry pickle eulogy.  I feel like we say that too much.  If Labonz doesn't have the cards at school,  where could they be?  Louise, I don't know if I expressed this enough,  - but this is literally killing me. - TINA: Louise?  I just wanted to say that I tried to get the cards back  from Ms. Labonz, but she said no.  But don't worry. They're in a safe place.  I mean, not really, they're in the drawer by her front door,  and she's gonna use them to pick up her neighbor's dog Spritzel's poop.  But, hey, forget that.  Let's just work on rebuilding our relationship.  Oh, great, there you are. Should we hug or something?  Wait, why do you have your lock-picking kit?  Rudy, the cards are at Labonz's.  We know she's not there 'cause it's Martini Tuesday.  Meet me at her house, stat. We're a go.  - RUDY: Okay, I've been - Uh-oh. Louise? Louise!  No go! No go! Aah!  - Gene come on! - What's going on?  I may have accidentally told Louise  exactly where Ms. Labonz has the Burobu cards in her house  and now Louise is going over there to break in!  Aah! She'll go to jail!  What will I wear to visit her?  You can't wear stripes, so that's out.  So, Bob, you'll be batting cleanup.  You feel loose?  (whispering): You look terrible.  - Thanks. - Wait, is the urn a pickle jar?  MORT: Yes, it is.  Did he want that or did you just run out of urns?  I think it's safe to assume it's what he would have wanted.  Hello. How are you?  Oh, God, I feel like everybody's looking at me.  Nah. I bet they all forgot.  Yeah, I know. He has some nerve showing up here.  They're probably talking about someone else.  What he did to Harry's face with that pickle  That-that could be anybody.  And now he's here in a wrinkled suit with his fly open.  Okay, that's you.  Oh, God. Should I zip it?  Don't give 'em the satisfaction.  LOUISE: Okay, looks like nobody's home.  This is what they mean by peer pressure.  This is everything they warned me about  in that after school special, Peers of a Clown.  Stop. You can't do this.  And I can't do this. My thighs are thundering.  This is breaking and entering, Louise. It's a crime.  Well, it's your fault I have to crime this crime  in the first place.  GENE: - Someone's coming!  - Hide. - Aah!  What the hell are they doing here?  Sorry we had to come here because my dumb roommate, Joyce,  wasn't a match for the kidney donation  and now she's just sitting on the couch with all her kidneys,  ruining everything.  BRANCA: It's okay.  Labonz has got that sweet backyard.  They're going to the backyard. Let's go.  (whispering): Or we could just leave.  Oh, you're going that way. Okay.  Who wants to play a drinking game?  BRANCA: Oh! Oh! Me, me, me, me, me!  (gasps) Our Burobu cards.  Bastards.  Hey there. I'm Alfred. Leafy greens.  I've known Harry a long time.  Our booths were right next to each other.  He was a good man, a proud man,  and when you got him talking about dill,  well, his face just lit up.  It's so beautiful.  And I'm, I'm, I'm glad we could all be here,  even if one of us committed an unforgivable act  for which he should be ashamed.  - Okay. - Mm.  Hi. Hi, hello. We're divorced.  LABONZ: Ha! Branca,  your slug has the lowest health points. Slug it.  This is a disgrace.  They don't even know the rules.  Well, nobody does.  - Rudy, just shush. - Sorry.  They're not acting that different.  Are they always drunk?  If only we could distract them,  get them out of the yard for a second,  and we had a rope or something.  Then we could tie it around my waist,  I could climb up this tree, and you guys could lower me down  and I could grab the cards.  Man, if only we had a rope. Too bad.  (gasps) There was a hose in the front yard.  - Damn. - I'll go get it.  You guys think of a way to distract them.  Are we talking streaking? Shall I disrobe?  Huh?  Mr. Frond?  Aah! Huh?  Are you stalking Martini Tuesday?  (laughing): N-No. That would be psychotic.  Okay, I am. It's just (sighs)   why didn't they invite me?  Is that a rhetorical question or ?  Just because I don't drink and I go to bed early  and I told them all  - I'm concerned about their drinking. - Uh-huh.  They don't think I'm cool enough?  Well, would a guy who's not cool enough go home every night  and put on Best Dance Music of the '90s  and dance his little heart out?  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I know how we can distract  I mean, how you can show them that you're cool.  - You do? Wait, why are you here? - Let's focus on you.  By any chance, do you have any music with you now?  - Uh, you tell me. - Oh, my God.  TINA: Is that Mr. Frond? What's Louise doing?  Is she his dealer?  You really think this will work?  - I never said that. - Wait, what?  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Just play the music, cool guy.  (humming and grunting)  (""Groove Is in the Heart"" by Deee-Lite playing)  - Oh, my. - What is that?  Every dance move in the world?  Go, go, go, go!  Come on, take the bait.  - What the hell? -  The chills that you spill   It's Frond. He's outside.  And I think he's dancing?  Let's hit it. And here's the cards for the switch out.  What? Louise. Your Mega Ultras.  Wait, aren't those cards fake?  - Gene! - I mean, hello.  Your groove I do deeply dig   No walls, only the bridge   My supper dish   My succotash wish   Lower. Lower.  (whispering): We're out of hose.  And also, bros before hose.  Arms too tiny.  Pull me up! Pull me up!  I couldn't ask for another   Pew, pew, pew, pew.  I couldn't ask for another   Pew, pew, pew, pew.  Well, shucks. What?  No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Tina, I need your freakishly long arms to grab those cards.  Louise, Th-Th-these cards are making you crazy.  - I'm not crazy! - Aah!  No, not at all. Here I go.  (nervous groaning)  (all groaning)  Groove is in the heart   Ah   (laughs) I'm gonna get my drink.  You keep filming. Aah!  Oh, hey, Ms. Labonz. You come here, too?  Tina, why are you hanging from a garden hose in my backyard?  I can see why you'd ask that. That's fair.  I bet this is a bath salts thing.  - Hi, Mr. Branca. - Hi, Tina.  Wait a minute. Is this about getting  those damn Burobu cards back?  Did Louise put you up to this?  I know you're there, Louise.  Oh, God, I'm feeling too dru I got to get down.  -  Groove is in the heart  - (panting): Are they coming?  They're not coming.  You know what? Screw 'em.  Where's the groove, Phillip?  It's in your heart. It's in your heart.  I'm gonna go treat myself  to some low-fat fro-yo from the gas station.  So long, suckers!  Tina, I know you didn't do this alone.  Who put you up to this?  Give her a martini. Then she'll talk.  Tina, tell me now.  It-it was it-it was  - me. - What?  It was all me. Did Louise try to stop me? Sure.  She was like, ""No, Tina, it's too dangerous,""  and I was all, ""Pfft. I am dangerous.""  And then what did she say?  Well, she was pretty blown away at that point.  So you were gonna climb up that hose by yourself?  Oh, um, yup.  Really? I teach you in gym.  Okay, Tina. Do it.  Y-Yup, no problem.  Oh, no. This is gonna go so badly.  I got to come clean.  (Tina grunting)  - (whispering): She's doing it. - What?  (grunting)  - It's so awkward. - Yeah.  (grunting)  Ah, I made it. Like I, uh,  knew I would the whole time.  That's inspiring. That's inspiring.  Very good.  You forgot the dumb cards, by the way.  Also, principal's office, first thing tomorrow.  I'm calling in sick, so don't forget.  Um, hello.  Uh, some of the stuff I was gonna talk about,  uh, kind of already got covered.  You know, like the dill stuff.  I-I was gonna anyway  Uh (clears throat)  Oh, God. He's bombing.  Do the jokes.  (whispering): Yes.  Oh, God. Um, well  I'm-I'm glad everybody could ""cu-come-ber"" to this service.  (Linda and Mort laugh)  (sighs) Right. And I, uh, I-I relish the support  - Boo! - Hey. You can't boo a eulogy.  Sure you can. Boo!  Look, everybody, Harry started it, okay?  He threw first.  You called his pickles too sweet.  What'd you think was gonna happen?  Well, they were too sweet.  I was the only one who was brave enough to say it.  Anyway, I wish I hadn't thrown the dumb pickle, okay?  - Everybody happy? - ALFRED: No.  Well, what am I supposed to do about it now, Leafy Greens?  - Apologize. - What?  Apologize to Harry.  - Yeah. Apologize to the urn. - Yeah.  (sighs) Oh, my God. Fine!  Uh, hi, Harry.  So, sorry I hit you in the face with a pickle.  (voice breaking): Truth is, I miss you, pal.  (clears throat)  I, uh I miss us.  (crying): I didn't think I was gonna get like this.  (whispering): Oh, he's crying. Now he's crying.  Wait, what's go what's going on?  It was stipulated in the will that I do this to you.  - Ow. - And then I was supposed to say,  ""Now we're even. Love you, buddy.""  Wow. That felt right.  I-I love you, too, Harry.  (to the tune of ""Danny Boy""):  Oh, Harry boy   The pickles   The pickles are calling.   Tina, I can't believe you did all that.  I mean, I can't move my arms now, but yeah.  You didn't make it look easy, but you did it.  Good day to wear underpants.  Boy, too bad about the cards, though.  You mean these?  - (grunts) - (gasps)  Our Burobu cards! And they've got bra on them.  You made the switch out?  I took a sip of a martini, too.  Well, that was more Mathy Cathy than me,  but we're both not into it. Stay in school.  (sighs) Well, I guess if we're being  all in-your-face heroic today  Here, Rudy. I want to give your Slugodactyl card back.  The card I traded for it is fake.  I guess I probably should have known.  The smell made me sick and I think it had a Minion on it.  I'll give the other guys their cards back, too.  And, Tina, I'm sorry I called you a scaredy-butt banana rat.  You're not. Your butt is strong.  - Mathy Cathy's, too. - Thanks.  (grunts) From both of us.  Rudy, do you want to have a moment with me like that?  Uh, yeah, sure, I'll have a moment.  - Pull my finger. - You got it, mister.  - Rudy, don't. Rudy. - Huh, what? - (grunts)  There's only one way to win this fight   Beat the other guy   The one rule to climbing the highest heights   Is to climb up really high   Burobu   - KIDS: Slugaconda! -  Burobu   Slugstronaut!  -  Burobu  - Slugvertible!  -  Burobu  - Slugicopter!  Slugsaphone!  -  Burobu  - Slugodactyl!  Sluggy Stardust!  -  Burobu  - Slugatomic!  - Slugpreme! -  Burobu."

Oh! Look at that.  - Bobby - Sorry.  TEDDY: So after that, I dreamt I was in a hot tub  - Mm-hmm. Mm. -  and then I woke up,  and I was in a cold sweat. You ever have that one?  - Nuh, uh, yeah, I think. - Okay. I'm coming clean.  I didn't really dream that.  But can you imagine how weird that would be if I did?  Hey, you guys need a hand over there?  - LINDA: No. - TINA: We're good.  - GENE: No thanks. - LOUISE: You stay there and chat.  Oh, thank God.  Uh, welcome to Bob's Burgers.  - Hi. - Hi.  Uh, do-do you remember us?  I-I do not, I'm sorry.  Oh, well, I'm Connor Coloroso. And this is Farrah.  - Hello. - And we had our very first date  here about three months ago.  Oh, uh, good.  Happy anniversary.  It's a funny story, actually. How we met.  We got into a fender-bender down by Wonder Wharf.  Speed Racer here clipped my bumper when I was parking.  It's true, Your Honor.  And after we exchanged information,  we decided to walk over here for lunch.  And I've been clipping her bumper ever since.  - TINA: Aw. - BOB: Hm.  - That's fun. - Well  what can we get for you new lovebirds? A couple of burgers?  Uh, actually, we came to tell you  We're engaged!  - BOB: Uh that's great. - LINDA: Congratulations.  LOUISE: I always knew you two would make it work.  Let's see that rock, girl.  Sorry, I heard someone say that on TV. I-Is it offensive?  We have a big question to ask you,  and we really hope you say yes.  Will you cater our wedding?  Us? Cater your wedding?  Don't take this the wrong way,  but don't you want your wedding to be nice?  'Course. But we're not really into the whole  traditional wedding thing, you know?  - Yeah. - I mean, we'd love to,  but we're not really set up for catering, per Se.  - Or very good at it. - Right.  And we sometimes use our kids,  which you probably might not want.  - What? We're great. - Oh, no, no, no,  we definitely want the kids as well.  Yeah, they brought us our burgers on that first date.  I have chills. Chills.  You should name your first baby The Belcher Children.  We really want this to happen.  Something that's meaningful to us,  instead of, like, a random caterer, you know,  with their chicken or their salmon.  That-That is kind of touching.  It'll be for about 50 people.  W-We could handle that.  And we're having the wedding by the water,  just outside of Bog Harbor.  Oh, o-outdoors?  Uh, I guess we could borrow a couple of coolers  and rent a gas grill.  Sure you can. They could cater your wedding  if it was in a ditch by the highway.  Hey, that's my wedding spot! Don't give it away.  So, when's the big day?  A week from Saturday.  - Huh? - What? A-A week from Saturday?  That's not a lot of time to prep.  We're both just really excited, and we don't wanna wait.  Right. What's the point of waiting?  Nobody gets better looking, huh? Right, Dad?  - Louise. - Sorry.  Oh. So romantic.  You know what, Connor, Farrah, let's do it.  - Great! - Yes! Thank you guys so much.  We'll call you with all the details.  - Sounds great. - Bye!  - They're never gonna make it. - What?  Y-You just said how romantic this is.  What else am I gonna say in front of them?  - What do you have against love? - Nothing!  How am I excited about this and you're not?  You love weddings. You love all this stuff.  It's just three months isn't enough time.  People should live together for at least 20 years.  Uh, wait, what? 20 years?  Okay, fine. But-But three months?  You haven't been in a fight yet. And if you did, it was cute.  You haven't even smelled each other's farts.  You're still holding them in.  You farted on our second date.  Because I knew you were the one.  Sitting on my lap. Just for the record.  You loved it.  If that's all it takes, I'm married to Dad, too.  And to a bunch of people.  My point is, we didn't get married  three months after that fart.  Well, I think this is great.  The rest of us are excited for this couple, right, kids?  - TINA: Hell yeah. - GENE: Meh.  LOUISE: No, I'm nine.  I mean, our burgers brought those people together.  It's kind of beautiful.  Bob, you're like a greasy Cupid. Do me, do me next.  I've been trying for a long time, Teddy.  Now come on, everybody, hands in the middle.  One, two, three best wedding ever!  No one said it. What happened?  You didn't tell us what to say.  Sorry. ""Best wedding ever"" on three.  Nah, the moment's passed.  I'll do it with you, Bob.  What? You're against this wedding.  I know, but I like to chant.  It's true. I got her to chant,  ""herpes, herpes, hooray"" once.  Oh, yeah, let's do that one again.  ALL EXCEPT BOB: Herpes, herpes, hooray!  Oh, my God.  Okay, this might be the most important day  in our restaurant's history.  Our food helped make this wedding possible,  and now it's gonna make it a success.  If the marriage tanks, is that our food's fault?  I blame the buns.  You can't blame our food if this marriage doesn't work.  They're the ones rushing into this.  The marriage is gonna work, Lin.  Carter and Farrah have a love that burns brighter  than any of us can comprehend.  - Connor. - What?  - It's Connor. - Who is Connor?  - Carter is Connor. - Oh. Right. Connor.  Anyway, the grill has a grease trap that needs to be cleaned  before I return it, and since I'm gonna do  most of the work today, I don't think it should be me.  - Not it! - Not it! - Not it!  One of you kids is doing it.  I'm not greasing up these gorgeous hands.  We'll figure something out. (coughs) Gene will do it.  - Bless you. - Whoa.  Pretty windy out here.  It's almost as if God is whispering,  ""Three months is not long enough.""  Say it, don't spray it, God.  Linda, shh. Here they come.  - Nothing! - Hey guys! Look at you.  Thank you.  I - I just said ""look at you."" I - I didn't  Sorry, I-I'm nervous.  So, I know you said that whatever I came up with  for the burger of the day would be fine, but I hope you like  what I landed on The ""Ring-GruyÃ¨re-er"" Burger.  - Like ring bearer. - Yeah.  It has GruyÃ¨re cheese and an onion ring on it.  Oh, my God, I love it!  And it comes with a side of Farro salad.  Get it? Like Farrah, but Farro.  - Wow. - Amazing.  Farro, Farrah. Oh, yeah.  And I figured we'd cook over here.  I don't want to get in the way of your crew  while you're setting up.  Oh, that's not a crew, Bob.  Those are all wedding guests.  We're having a very do-it-yourself wedding.  Oh, people love those.  It's DIY, but, you know,  we have the important stuff taken care of.  Your burgers and Farrah's grandma's cake.  Grandma couldn't make the trip, but she baked her famous  red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting for us.  My cousin drove it all the way here from Atlanta.  The lost city of Atlanta?!  But the cream cheese frosting needs to be refrigerated.  Can we put it in one of your coolers?  I guess we could, um, yeah, make some room. Sure.  Also, uh, you're looking a little shorthanded out there.  Y-You wanna borrow my kids to help set up?  Oh, yeah, that'd be great.  Would it, though?  Kids, go be helpful.  I'll try, but geez, I'm not so good with this stuff. Whoa!  - Louise! - Ugh, fine.  This isn't what we signed up for.  Right? We were just supposed to  hand Dad lettuce and stuff.  Now we're chair monkeys?  It's not so hard. We're just taking chairs  and lining them up in rows. Oh, boy.  I like posing for pictures more than most people,  but you're really going to town.  Sorry, it's just everyone loves kids in wedding pictures.  That's why child weddings used to be so popular.  PHOTOGRAPHER: Nah-huh, uh-huh.  Okay, that ought to do it though, right?  (chuckles nervously) There's gotta be some other kids  around here you can photograph.  A flower girl or a tuxedo baby or something  Nope! Uh, do you guys want me to jingle my keys for you?  Huh? Are you too old for that?  - Uh, give 'em a jingle. - Jingle-jangle.  - Ooh, yup, I love it. - Jingle-jangle.  (indistinct chatter)  Wow, this cake is pretty big.  Yeah, it's a wedding cake. They're big.  That's their job that's the one thing they have to be.  I think I can squeeze this in here.  Oh thank God. It fits.  (sighs) We're doing everything.  Now we're cooling the cake.  Those dum-dum's didn't think anything through  - Hello! - Hey, you!  Uh, good news. Uh, the cake fits in the cooler, no problem.  - I did it. Linda did nothing. - Hey.  So, the ceremony's gonna begin in a little bit.  Is it possible you guys could join us? As guests?  It would mean so much to us.  I-I mean if you can swing it, time-wise.  Oh, uh, yes, we would love to.  Uh, thank you.  Great. See you out there.  Wow. Has anyone ever been a caterer  and a guest at the same wedding?  - Are we pioneers? - (gasps)  No one's ever dreamed that big, I guess.  I'm going to pretend that you're being sincere  and that we are pioneers.  And we're done.  Someone's rows got pretty good there near the end.  Mine. My rows.  What are those people doing?  Oh, they're putting something under every seat.  Oprah much?  So, uh, what's in the box?  Oh, no-no-no, don't open those, kids.  It's a surprise for during the wedding.  Ooh, you had me at ""surprise for during the wedding.""  I just said it, though.  Yeah, and that's where you had me.  You've lost me now.  Oh no, no-no-no, the  the photo of them river rafting.  (moans)  (""Pachelbel's Canon"" playing)  (phone buzzing)  - Hello? - Bob, it's Teddy.  (quietly) Oh, why'd I pick up?  How's the wedding going? You have everything all set?  Yeah, we had to hurry through prep because  they invited us to attend the ceremony.  - Wow. - Which I think is, uh,  about to start, so I gotta  Hold on, hold on. I wrote a toast for you.  Just in case they ask. They might not ask, but they  Teddy, I'm not gonna be asked to do a toast.  -  you wanna be ready. - I'm hanging up now.  ""As a burger man, I can tell you every romance  has its share of pickles and beefs.""  I, uh, did you Ge  Welcome to Connor and Farrah's wedding.  Before we begin, the bride and groom asked  that I thank everyone who chipped in today.  Your help is as personal to them as their childhood blankets,  which adorn the wedding arch.  Farrah called hers Frankie. ""Frankie the Blankie.""  We were allowed to bring our blankies to this thing?  Now, if you will please rise.  - (""Bridal March"" playing) - (guests ooh and ahh)  Are you crying already?  It's just this is all because of our food.  They'll be telling their grandchildren about us.  (wind gusting) Ooh, oh, geez, this wind!  When Connor and Farrah asked me to (wind breaks up audio)   all right, but the only shoes I have are sandals  We'll have to wait for my fungal infection to clear up  (audio out)   Sammy Davis, Jr.  - BOB: Uh-oh. - LOUISE: Yeah.  Who would've guessed a big piece of poster board  would keep blowing away?  I told you. This is what happens  when you rush into a wedding. Oh, my face!  (wind gusting)  Is that guy flashing the officiant?  No, Tina, he's trying to block the wind from the microphone.  The bride and groom have a special surprise  that they feel symbolizes their love.  If you would all look under your seats  Finally.  OFFICIANT: I'm going to count to three,  and we'll open our boxes together.  One, two, three.  A dead butterfly?  That's what I got, too.  Mine looks okay.  Oh, no, dead.  Oh, my God.  A beautiful cloud of butterflies to symbolize  Oh, uh, anyone get a live one?  Okay, well, let's see if we can get them to fly at the same time.  Everyone, just toss your dead butterfly into the air  and they'll look alive.  One, two, three.  - (wind gusts) - BOB: Oh, God.  They can swim, probably, right?  Maybe the live ones can float on the dead ones?  And now, the bride and groom have written their own vows,  which they will read to one another.  Farrah, the Oxford English Dictionary define  (microphone distortion)  I can't hear.  The P.A. cut out.  - FARRAH: Frankie! - Oh, no.  Looks like Frankie's going to Hollywood.  Okay, that was, uh, well, uh, we all saw it.  It-it didn't go well.  It was bad.  - Yeah. - Really bad.  Wait, that was the wedding?  Yes. Which is why  we have to make this the best reception ever.  Our food is what brought them together,  and now it's the only thing that can possibly save this day.  Don't put so much pressure on yourself, Bob.  Yeah, cut yourself some slack, B-dawg.  Uh, the ""B"" stands for ""Bob."" That's you.  - Can I not be B-dawg? - Sleep on it?  Anyway, we just need to stay focused  and make sure everything goes perfectly.  - The wind blew out the grill. - Damn it!  Bob, calm down.  Let's just move the grill behind the car.  Right, right, right, of course.  (quietly): B-dawg's freaking out.  Okay, it seems to be staying lit.  Uh, your mom and I will man the grill,  you guys form an assembly line with the meat,  GruyÃ¨re and onion rings.  And I need everyone focused.  Oh, my God, what are you doing?  We're onion accessorizing.  - We're fancy. - You know what? Forget it.  You guys go do something far away from here.  Your mom and I will take care of this.  Let's go before they change their minds, huh?  (sighs) Okay, Bob, you can do this.  This wedding is my war zone  And I'm the doctor in it  I've got to save their special day   Got to cater it to the limit  Something so important  Our burgers were their Cupid  Got to give Farrah and what's-his-name   A perfect reception  To prove my job's not stupid  So do I take this meat to grill just right   I do   Take this cheese to melt on top so nice   -  I do  -  Bob, this isn't on you   That ceremony was upsetting   The way those two rushed into this   You'd think it was a shotgun wedding   But do I take these buns to have and hold, I do   All you can do is do your best-est   Toast them perfect, so their love grows old, I do   They are a couple of hot messes   And do I swear that I won't screw this up, I do   Bob, you're crazy   And do I need this more than anything   Do I think you've lost your mind on this   I do.   Bored.  Hey, you want to see who can get in the most pictures?  How will we know who gets in the most? Honor system?  Honor? No. We'll, uh, look at his camera  after the thing and count them up.  What are we playing for? Pink slips?  Let's say whoever gets in the least amount of pictures  is the loser and has to clean the grease trap on the grill.  Deal. I got this wrapped up.  There's a reason they call it photo-Gene-ic.  I'm in, too. Your butts are about to get shuts down.    Snap, snap  Grease trap  Snap, snap, grease trap  -  Snap, snap, grease trap - (fake laughing)  Ha  - Oh, God, where is it? - What?  We're missing, like, 20 slices of GruyÃ¨re.  If we can't find it, the burger of the day won't make sense  and dinner will be just one more thing that went wrong today.  I can't let this happen.  Take a deep breath, Bob.  The burgers will be delicious either way.  And you're not responsible for anything that happened today.  We're responsible for them getting married, Lin.  We're responsible for all of this.  Just because we brought these two together in some way  doesn't mean it's our fault that they had  a poorly planned wedding during a windstorm.  Cheese, where are you?  I mean, their relationship started with a car accident,  and now it's a train wreck.  - Hi, hello. - Not helping, Lin.  My point is nothing bad that's happened today is your fault.  Found it!  Oh Oh, God. Uh uh!  (shouts)  - No! - Okay, that one's your fault.  Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.  - Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. - Should we leave? The car's right here.  Should we just leave? We'll just go.  - (groans) - They'll send the kids home.  BOB: I killed it. It's ruined.  T-This is Grandma's special cake.  The second most important thing after the burgers.  - Probably more important. - Lin!  You're right, it doesn't matter.  - Okay, we got to tell them. - No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  W-We have to fix it.  W-We have to try and reshape it.  If it gets dark enough, right? No one will notice.  Oh, who am I kidding?  I've ruined their whole wedding.  No, no, Bob, I'll do it.  You cook, and I'll try to reshape it.  I've eaten a lot of cake in my life,  so, uh, hopefully, I can do it from memory.  Mm. Oh, it's good.  - Lin. Don't - Bob, let me work.  Ah. Pretty sure I got this one locked up.  That grease trap has one of your names on it.  Dream on, sister. I've been in, like, every picture he's taken.  - (camera shutter clicks) - Um, except that one.  Okay, then. You guys want to end it now?  - Should we could them up? - Fine with me.  I'll call you Rizzo and you Frenchy,  'cause you're about to be in grease.  Shut your cheese flaps and get ready to clean that grease trap.  Hey, clicky fingers. Clicky.  PHOTOGRAPHER: Uh, you guys almost done?  I-I really should be still taking photos.  Shh, shh, shh. You're making me lose count.  Not looking good for you, Gene.  So far, Tina has the most pictures,  and I have one more than you.  I thought the camera loved me.  PHOTOGRAPHER: That's it. We're back to the first picture  I took today, that's-that's all of them.  - Ha! Gene loses. - Wait, I'm in that picture.  What? Where?  GENE: I'm reflected in her sunglasses.  I was trying to get her attention because I thought  she was Helen Mirren.  Wait a second, that's not Helen Mirren?  GENE: Look, I'm in there twice.  I don't lose, Louise does.  - No! - Yes.  (sighs) I got to call my mom  and tell her I didn't meet Helen Mirren.  Well, I won, as predicted.  I shutted your butts.  Should we go back and see how much grease you have to clean?  - You shut your butt. - You shut your butt.  - No, you shut your butt! - My butt is shut.  Mine's wide open!  - (indistinct chatter) - MAN: Mmm, mmm.  These burgers are amazing.  Hey, save room for Farrah's grandma's cake.  - It is going to blow your mind. - Really?  But cake's cake. Y-You've had one, you've had 'em all.  Sometimes, you don't even want something sweet after a meal.  Am I right?  (chuckling): I mean, it's sometimes too much.  (stifled laugh) Bob, come on, you're too much.  (laughs) Let's get to that cake cutting.  (chanting): Cake, cake, cake, cake!  ALL (chanting): Cake! Cake! Cake!  LINDA (chanting): Cake! Cake!  Lin, I thought you were fixing the cake.  Sorry, you know I can't resist a chant.  (sighs) Well, go back and fix it.  Right. Right, right, right.  Oh, God.  Uh, okay!  Here's the cake.  ALL: Ooh.  Okay, Linda, uh, bring it into the light.  W-We want to take a picture.  No, I'm good.  Linda, come on.  Okay.  (chuckles) Y-You're going backwards.  - You're going backwards. - Um  Just kidding. Ha.  Here I come.  - Oh, dear Lord. - Oh. Oh, no.  What-what happened to Grandma's cake?  What do you mean?  Um, it's all smushed.  What? No, that's how it looks.  It's, uh, Grandma made it like that.  You know.  She's so old.  (laughs) Uh, t-this is a-a joke, right?  I mean, now you'll bring out the real cake? Ha, ha?  No. Listen, Farrah, Carter  - Connor. - Connor.  I-I'm sorry.  I-I got myself worked up  trying to make everything perfect for tonight,  especially after literally everything went wrong today,  so I was rushing around and I fell on your cake.  (crying): Oh, my God, oh, my God.  Everything did go wrong today.  I keep telling myself it was all okay,  just one thing, here or there, but it isn't okay.  The wind blew everything everywhere.  I lost my baby blanket that I was gonna give to my children.  Poor little baby, The Belcher Children.  Louise.  And now Grandma's cake is ruined.  Is this just one big omen?  (stammers) Of course not.  We're-We're gonna be okay.  - But what if we aren't? - (microphone distortion)  Farrah, I'm so glad you brought that up.  Oh, God.  Look. When you first told me you were getting married  after three months,  I thought you were bananas in the tailpipe.  I thought it was too short.  You haven't smelled each other's farts.  You haven't been through enough bad stuff together, I thought.  But today, you really packed it in.  The universe cut a big fart all over your wedding.  And also someone clogged up the Porta potty, which is hard.  Yeah, someone.  It was like that when I got there.  Anyway, most people would have cracked earlier,  but you let it all roll off your back.  And then my extremely passionate husband  fell on your grandma's cake and broke you.  ""Broke"" is a little  But looking at you now, can I tell you something?  I guarantee you two are gonna make it.  (sniffles) We are?  Yeah. You are.  The way you handled everything today shows  how all you really care about is each other.  And you know what else?  The cake doesn't look great, but I bet it still tastes great.  There's no dirt in it or anything,  just pretend like you already chewed it!  Mmm, mmm! Oh, it's delicious, Grandma. (laughs)  If you don't look at it, it's fine.  Just like you guys.  Wait, what does that mean?  Oh! No, I mean  Not not that! I didn't mean that.  But you do have mascara running down your face  like a crazy clown, I'm sorry.  - My crazy clown. - (sniffles)  Oh, you.  Now, let's try some cake, huh?  Oh, oh Mm, it's really falling apart.  (laughs) Also, I was wrong.  There is a little dirt in it, and a salad fork.  I lost that in there when I was trying to reshape it,  so look out for that. Enjoy.  Who is this woman?  I'm the caterer, ma'am.  The caterer.  BOB: Linda, what you said before was beautiful.  I-I think you saved the wedding.  No, we saved the wedding, Bob.  We made this wedding.  Take that, doctors in war zones.  Yeah. I mean, they do good stuff, too.  But not everyone can make burgers.  Hey! It's Frankie!  TINA: Talk about a wet blanket.  - Get it? - Too soon. - Oh, God.  What?  Ugh, there's a dead butterfly in the cake.  - (gagging) - Does it taste like butter?  If the answer is no, lie to me.  Oh, it's just a leaf.  Mmm, it's good.  Oh, oh (gagging)  This wedding is my war zone   And I'm the doctor in it   I've got to save their special day   Got to cater it to the limit   But do I take these buns to have and hold   I do   All you can do is do your best-est   Toast 'em perfect so their love grows old   -  I do  -  They are a couple of hot messes   And do I swear that I won't screw this up   I do  -  Bob, you're crazy   And do I need this more than anything   Do I think you've lost your mind on this   LINDA and BOB:  I"
"1  LOUISE: 16, 17,   Louise, that's plenty of sugar in your oatmeal.  My body, my rules, Father.  - I'm crumbling bacon in mine. - Gene, stop it.  Wait. Is that good? Give-give me some bacon.  Ooh, fun oatmeal mix-ups.  - Ow. - Bacon block!  Wait. Here's the Boyz 4 Now story.  - Zip your B-holes. - B-holes?  - Breakfast holes. Shh. - Oh.  This is Olsen Benner, reporting  - from the convention center - (laughing): Hi.   where the Boyz 4 Now open call auditions  - Hi! I'm on TV! -  are about to get underway.  After popular boy-band boy Boo Boo left the band,  their album Three is More Than Four did not  top the charts.  Three is more than four   So, the Boyz 3 Now are hunting for a quote unquote,  ""new Boo Boo,"" so they can be four once more.  I'm here with Boyz 4 Now super-fan Gertie Humikowski.  I don't like that there are only three.  There has to be four!  BENNER: And now, the nationwide talent search is here  in the Seymour's Bay area,  where boys aged 12 to 17 will soon be lining up.  Girls, however, will not be permitted within 50 yards  of the entrance after several incidents around the country.  We had to rescue a girl from an air duct.  She crawled right up in there. Not safe, girls. Don't do it.  So girls, stay away. Boys, come to play.  Whoo. That's gonna be a real smorgas-boy'd.  They're never gonna find someone  as slappable as Boo Boo to take his place.  His face fits right in my tiny little hand.  - Gene, you want to go audition? - No way.  I'm gonna replace Baby Spice when she grows up,  but she's just a baby, so that's gonna be a while.  No one asked me if I wanted to audition.  I'm the same age as Matt.  - Matt's 89? - What? No. Matt's 17.  Yeah, sure, sure. Sure he is.  I think it's gonna be a good day for the restaurant.  The heat wave is gonna bring us a lot of foot traffic  from people heading to the beach, right?  Yeah. They've got feet, and they got to eat.  LINDA: Bob, I thought we got napkins yesterday.  - Where'd they go? - I must've left them in the car.  Louise, can you go get them?  You know I can't use my legs, Father.  (coughs) I have cough-legs.  I wish I could run like the other children.  I'll go, Dad. I like a little junk from the trunk.  All right, Tina, the car is at the curb down the block.  We couldn't pull into the alley to drop them off  because your mom said  the raccoons were having a birthday party.  It wasn't a birthday party, Bob.  Little King Trash Mouth and his husband Gary  were renewing their vows, I think.  It's their anniversary, so it makes sense.  No, it doesn't, but it's fine.  - Yeah. - (scoffs) What?  - No, yeah. - No. No.  - Yeah. - Hmm  No, it was definitely their anniversary,  now that I think about it.  Hey, uh, mm.  - Mm-hmm. Aah! - Oh.  Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry.  Um, can I help you up?  Whoa.  Girl, when these napkins are in the air   I want to kiss your lips and comb your hair   It's love at first sight   Now it's our wedding night   Is this really happening?   Girl, are we napkin-ing?   Yes, this is happening   Girl, we are napkin-ing   Napkin-ing.   - Are-are you okay? - Oh, yeah.  Uh, hi. I'm Tina.  - Yeah, I'm Damon. - Damon. Damon.  Yeah. Ah, shoot. You know what?  I'd love to stay and talk, but I have to catch a bus  to the convention center for a tryout.  - So bye. - Oh, good luck.  Uh, thanks. Sorry about your napkins.  I hope they can still clean things.  Damon, I  Oh. He's gone.  But he left this shoe.  - No, wait. That's a pigeon. - (cooing)  Oh, hey, Tina. Those napkins look different.  Someone bumped into me, and I dropped them, and also,  my whole life is probably gonna change now.  Here, Tina, give 'em to me, hon.  Okay, but I need to keep one  as a souvenir of the day I met Damon.  He was running to catch the bus to the Boyz 4 Now auditions,  and he bumped into me, and we touched hands,  and it might be love at first sight.  - Welp, here we go again. - What do you mean?  Oh, I don't know. It's not like you fall in love at first sight  all the time.  Whoa.  Whoa.  (grunts) Excuse me. Whoa.  Okay, maybe once or twice.  - A minute. - It's fine.  You're young, you have fun.  What are you guys trying to say?  We're trying to say you're something  that rhymes with ""shmoy shmazy.""  Okay, I'm not boy crazy.  I'm boy focused.  And I really think Damon could be the one.  One of many. Many ones.  All right, guys, leave Tina alone.  She has an active imagination about boys.  TINA: It's not my imagination.  My feelings are real. Damon is probably my soul mate.  I'll-I'll show you. I'll I'll go down  to those auditions and find Damon  - and start our life together. - Oh, Tina.  They're not gonna let girls in the auditions.  Remember? The news? No girls allowed.  (sighs) Damn it. Well, then, I'll dress as a boy.  - Ooh, that's fun. - No.  Not that that's not a great idea, but we need Tina here.  It-It's gonna be a busy day.  Ugh. Fine. (sighs)  - Aw. - ""Aw"" what?  Tina wants to go find her crush. It's sweet.  Wait, Linda, you want her to go?  I don't think it'll do any harm, Bob.  They'll probably just spot that she's a girl  and send her home anyway.  (sighs) Fine.  Tina, we have some good news.  (sighs) What?  You can dress as a boy and go find that kid.  I can? Thank you. I'm gonna prove  that Damon's my true love, so say good-bye to Tina.  And say hello to Dino.  My Annie wig! I knew she'd live to dance another day.  Next time you see me, I'll be in a serious relationship  with one boy only. Damon.  I'm not boy crazy. I've never felt more boy sane.  Am I nuts or is Dino hot?  - (door bells ding) - Linda, Bob. Linda, Bob.  Teddy, what is it? Why are we whispering?  I-I just need to show you what's in the box.  I found this at the place I'm working up the street.  I just need you to take care of it till I'm off later.  Promise me you'll take care of it.  - Promise me, promise me! - What? No.  We don't even know what it is yet.  Okay. I'll show you.  - No loud noises. - I'll tell my butt.  Oh, my God, what is it?  LOUISE: What did you do to Mort?  - BOB: Huh. Is that a squirrel? - TEDDY: A squirrel?  You think this cute little guy is a stupid, lowlife squirrel?  No, I would never bring a squirrel in here, Bobby.  What do you think, I'm out of my mind?  - What is it then? - It's a rat. A baby rat.  - Oh. Okay, get out. - Bob, no, please, please.  We can't have a rat in the restaurant, Teddy.  It's just for a couple of hours. Otherwise, he's gonna die.  - Okay. - All you got to do is  keep him warm with a heating pad,  and then give him some sugar water.  - You can do that, right, Bobby? - Hmm.  I've nursed dozens of baby rats.  Your nipples must be a mess.  Look, Teddy, I'm sorry.  - It's just that we can't - (rat squeaking)  BOB: Oh, my God, look at it.  I'm crying. (sobs)  I would die for this rat.  (crowd shouting)  Ugh. What was I thinking?  No one's gonna believe I'm a boy.  GIRL: Oh, my God, a boy!  That's right, sweetheart. Yes!  Okay, just gonna pop in, find Damon,  tell him I think we're meant to be together forever,  and I won't get distracted by all the other   Oh, my God.  Aah, so many butts age 12 to 17. Okay. Focus, Tina.  Damon's here somewhere. All I have to do  is stand in line and not get distracted.  Dude, you got any gum?  Oh, I know that I'm just asking for gum   And that I might seem pretty dumb   But I could be real fun   I could be the one   Now sweat.   Sweat  Aah! No, I'm here for Damon! Uh, uh, uh  Ah! Ha-ha, not going in there.  That was a joke.  (exhales) Come on, Dino, don't stress.  You're a strong, confident young man who isn't afraid of urinals.  Good for you, man.  Coming in. Just another boy, so no big deal.  BOB: So, Teddy said we need  to keep him very warm on the heating pad  and feed him every one to two hours.  Or her. Girls can be rats, too, Bob.  It does look like she has a little penis, though. Aw.  - It's bigger than yours, Mom. - Gene.  (rat fussing)  - ALL: Aw - LINDA: Baby.  Okay, this heating pad shuts off automatically every 30 minutes,  - so we'll need to set a timer. - On it.  And I've got his sugar water all mixed up  for when he gets hungry.  And I'm gonna order him the box set of The Wire  for when he's ready.  And I'll teach him how to fight.  Probably Brazilian jiu-jitsu, because he's so small.  -(phone ringing) - A lot of ground stuff, lot of grappling.  Hello. Bob's Burgers. Oh, hi, Teddy. What's that?  Oh. Okay. All right, new thing:  Teddy says we got to rub the rat's butt and genitals  to make it pee and poop after we feed it.  That's all you, Dad.  I probably shouldn't be the one to do that,  - since I cook all the food. - Well, and I carry all the food.  - And I eat all the food. - And I don't want to.  (sighs) Fine, I'll just wash my hands really, really well.  Like how surgeons do.  That's kind of cool. I'll scrub in.  There you go, Dad. You're like a cool, smelly surgeon.  Dr. McGreasy.  I like the rat more than I like all of you.  Focusing on Damon with all these other boys around  is gonna be harder than I thought. Aah!  Oh, sorry, I didn't think anyone was in here.  That-that's okay. Are you hiding, too?  - Um, kinda. - My name's Chad.  I'm Dino. Why are you hiding in here?  Well, uh, I guess I'm just nervous.  I-I just wish I had a friend here, you know?  To talk to. But all-all my best friends are girls.  Oh, really?  - Yeah. - Whoa.  CHAD:  Hey, girl, it's me   I'm your best friend   I'm super cute, but for now   I'm just your friend   You like that jock   So I'll just wait   And I'll even get him to take you out on a date   We'll make a bet for his Corvette   That he can't make you prom queen 'cause you're brunette   I'm in the friend zone   And I'm so alone   So I'll just keep on fighting for you   While I wear my headphones   I feel sad.  And even when you become prom queen   I'll keep on hoping I can be the boy of your dreams   Why are you kissing her?  I was just going to prom with you as a bet.  - A bet? (cries) - Tina!  You were here all along, and now I finally see you.  Not in the friend zone   And I'm not alone   Now let's kiss over this cake   'Cause it's your birthday, I guess.   Yeah, let's say it's my birthday.  - (humming) - CHAD: Um  - Ah! Damon! - Chad.  No, I know. S-Sorry, I-I got to go.  Look, I put a little table in there for him.  I made it out of a bottle cap.  Should we make him some chairs?  - Put in a little rug? - Lava lamp.  - Beanbag. One bean. - (door bells ding)  Hello? Bob!  Your not-friendly health inspector's here.  (chuckles)  Oh, my God, it's Hugo.  Crap, crap, crap, crap!  (gulping)  (exhales) Thank you.  Normally, I wouldn't drink your water, Bob,  but I'm inspecting the outdoor stands at the beach today.  It's hot out there, and I'm very susceptible to dehydration.  They should keep dumping water on you,  like when they transport a dolphin.  Well, you probably got to get going, so, uh  You know what? I think I'll have another water.  I'm not driving. (laughs)  (nervous laughter)  Great. Great. Great, great, great, great, great.  - Can we just kill him? - Maybe, honey. Maybe.  All right, focus, focus, focus.  He's cute. (gasps)  Damon! I'm coming for you!  I'm okay. Dino's okay.  Damon! Hi. Excuse me, um, can I cut in front of you?  My little brother is way up in the line,  and he forgot his healthy snack?  - Yeah, sure, whatever. - All right, thanks.  Hey, can I cut in front of you?  My brother's up ahead, and he forgot his shoes.   his voice medicine.  his lucky rabbit's butt.  Hi, um, is there any way I can cut in front of you?  - See, my little - What? No.  - But-but I - Dude, you got to wait in line  like the rest of us, all right?  Ugh, you have to let me through.  My brother is ahead of me in line.  He's holding my place,  and I promised my mom, Barbara, that I would watch him.  His name is Simon Garfunkel,  and he loves to laugh. All of that is true.  No dice, Beans and Rice. You're not getting by me.  Whoa.  And in conclusion, that is why I think  we should buy the company I was talking about.  - With money. - (chuckles)  Do you want to say something, Jesse?  (scoffs) Yeah, I do.  I'm the guy who disagrees with everything you say   You think that I'm a jerk   And I feel the same way about you   What are we gonna do?   Your faxes are so taxing   Your opinions are so strong   We'll never get along, it's true   - When I say red, you say blue  Red. - Blue.  Oh, I hate the way I love you   And I love the way I hate you   -  And I kind of want to pinch you  -   But I kind of want to date you, too   What should we do?   But then we find ourselves going   To Paris in first class   Outside of the boardroom, I kind of like your sass   We get loose   Drinking too much grape juice   I can't wait to land   Wait, am I holding your hand? Rap time.  When we land in Paris, France   We take our time, we do the dance   Supposed to be business, but we're acting like friends   Sampling the cheeses and we're eating the breads   What is going on up in my noodle?   You fall into the Seine while we're chasing a poodle   I rescue you 'cause I'm really brave   But I'm the one who's getting saved   Then we do the big meeting, a perfect team           They pay a billion French monies for our scheme   Then we're getting married and we're living the dream   Oh, I hate the way I love you   But I love the way I hate you   And I kind of want to pinch you   But I kind of want to date you, too   What should we do?   TINA: Do you want to say something, Jesse?  Yes, I do.  Are you free for lunch?  - Yes. - What, dude?  - Girl. I got a girl here! - Oh, crud.  Hey! Somebody stop that dude.  He's cutting in line, it's totally not fair.  Rules are rules, guys. Rules are rules.  (exhales)  All right, Bob, thank you for all the water.  I don't know why I'm so parched.  You're a thirsty bitch.  - Gene, don't say that. - Why not?  Well, I'm not gonna pay you for it because it's just water.  - Great, bye. - (door bells ding)  - (rat squeaking) - What was that?  Oh, t-that was my, uh, uh, text notification.  Text notification, really? Who's the text from, Bob?  Oh, uh, my, uh, mistress. She's, uh, gross.  Uh, s-she's fine. We're all fine.  Okay, I'll see you later, bye.  I didn't mean the ding, Bob.  I meant the squeaks.  Uh, let me, uh, let me go check on that.  Pick and roll, Gene. Pick and roll.  - (Gene grumbling) - Whoa.  Drag him down, drag him down!  - I am! Grab a leg! - Get off of me!  Aha!  Just flipping the burgers, Hugo.  What burgers, Bob?  Didn't we tell you? Dad went insane.  It's okay, Dad. Flip your burgers.  Hmm, that's funny. I thought I was going insane,  because for a minute there, I thought I heard the sound  of a squeaking baby rat!  (gasps) What?  And I bet he's right there!  Time for me to say hello to your little friend.  (gasping)  What in the ?  I know there was a rat in there.  I've seen this a thousand times.  The heating pad, the tiny little table you made for him.  As if he would ever eat at that table. It's ridiculous!  Uh, well, Hugo, we just had the heating pad down here for, uh  My PMS.  So hormonal right now, so angry.  Yeah. That's why I have a mistress.  And Gene and I were playing tomato dolls.  Yeah, we-we take the tomatoes and  And put them in that box.  Yeah, tomato dolls.  Eh, we can't afford toys. Sad.  - (rat squeaking) - There it is again!  Bob, is that rat in your underwear?  Well, Hugo, I'm pretty sure you're not allowed  to look at my privates, so I guess  (straining): we'll never know.  - God, I respect this man. - (Bob moaning)  A-And, uh, and now we're closing, so, uh,  - closing time, bye. - Yeah, yeah. That's right.  We are closed for the day, so good-bye Hu (moans)  Get out of here! Get away from my dad!  Fine. You win this one, Bob.  But I'll be back with a warrant for your underwear.  LOUISE: (growls) Just go.  HUGO: Stop it. Stop pushing me.  (door bells ding)  Ugh. Okay, I got to get it out.  Oh, God, it's going lower.  - Bob, no! - (screams)  Ah, ah, oh! Oh, wait, it's-it's fine now.  - (panting): Damon. - Yeah?  Hi. Um, I don't know if you'll recognize me.  - We met earlier today. - Uh  Oh. We did. Sure.  No, I don't. I don't remember you.  Uh, this is my best friend Hayden.  - Sup? - Whoa.  I think you're out of this world   But you're my best friend's girl   I want to kiss your face, oh, oh   I'm so lost in space   My best friend Hayden?  What are you doing here in space?  I'm just here with my colleague slash girlfriend Tina.  You're supposed to be down on the ground doing ground stuff.  - I finished it. - Well, maybe space  isn't big enough for the both of us.  Yeah. You're right. That's why you should leave.  I'll stay here with Tina, and you go do ground stuff.  - Boys, stop. Don't fight over me. - Rap battle.  What are you doing in space? It ain't your place   Hands off my girl or I'll hit your face   I didn't come to fight, I came to dance, 'cause out in space   We don't need pants   Yeah, that's right, don't be mad at me   My pants flew off 'cause there's no gravity   Keep talking.  (harmonizing):  There's no pants in space   Uranus can't see your anus   And Venus can't see your penis   -  Pants on Jupiter  -  There's nothing stupider   Oh, you moon the Moon, it moons you back   It moons me back   In space, we don't wear slacks.   Hey, what's the policy on shirts here?  Do you think they would float?  Just want to whip them off real quick?  Cool, cool, cool, cool.  Damn it.  Damon, I am so sorry.  - Sorry for what? - For not loving you enough.  - I'm sorry, what? - Um What's happening?  Yes, that's right. It's me.  The beautiful, aloof, yet very kind girl who carries napkins.  Oh, uh Yeah, yeah. From earlier.  Yes. From that incredible moment.  - I mean, ah mm-Kay. - Shh.  I came here to find you so we could turn that moment  into a million moments.  But my family was right. I am boy crazy.  (sighs) I'm nuts for butts.  Hey, it's a girl!  I've got seven non-boys in the warm-up room.  Requesting backup.  So, she's not in any real trouble,  but we got to make sure an adult takes the girls home,  or else they keep sneaking in over and over again.  (sighs) God, I didn't think this is how my life would turn out.  So, where is he? Where's the dream boy to top all dream boys?  Out getting a marriage license?  No, you were right.  You were all right. I am boy crazy.  I fantasized about 3.5 other boys on my way to find Damon.  Couldn't even make it one afternoon focused on one boy.  - Aw. You know what, Tina? - What?  I think it's great that you're boy crazy.  - You do? - Of course.  We all think it's great. Right?  - I love it. - Get it, girl!  You love it, too. Right, Bob?  Yeah, I think it's great that you go crazy a lot for them.  Huh. Maybe being boy crazy is okay.  It's great. You have imagination and heart.  You're a hopeful romantic.  You fall in love as many times as you want, honey.  Each one is lucky to have you.  Except Jimmy Jr. I'm not sold on him.  - Wait, what? - Nothing.  MAN (over radio): We need everyone to the front  of the convention center. The winner is being announced.  - Winner? That was quick. - Yeah, the boys are gonna sing  with the winner out in front of the building.  You want to come out and watch this dumb publicity stunt?  How dumb we talking?  I could go for another visit to the boy-ffet.  There she is.  Dad, why are you carrying a box?  Oh, it's Teddy's baby rat.  - We're kind of co-parenting. - Can I see him?  He-he's gonna be a mess if we wake him up from his nap.  - Can we do it later? - I was just being nice.  - I don't really want to see him. - Yeah, right.  ANNOUNCER: Ladies and girls,  put your hands together for Matt, Griffin, Allen!  And let's meet the newest member of the band.  He's coming out of the crowd right now.  Who is he? Come on up here and let us get a look at your face.  - (crowd gasping) - Boo Boo!  Did you miss me?  (cheering)  I mean, I-is it him? I-I'm not even sure. Who cares?  Because I missed you. But mostly, I missed myself.  Because I just wasn't myself without these guys.  The right number of boys for you   Is four, four-ever   I'm back   The right number of boys for you   -  Is four, four-ever  - BOO BOO: Come on!  One is the loneliest number   And tea for two is bland   Three's a crowd, so say it loud   Four, no more, is where it's at 'cause   The right number of boys for you   Is four, forever   -  Why not five?  -  You'll feel alive   -  Or even six  -  Yeah, get your kicks   -  How about seven?  -  Sounds like heaven   -  Eight could be great  -  No pants in space   More, more, more forever   -  More, more, more forever.  - Boys!  The right number of boys for you   Is four, forever   The right number of boys for you   Is four, forever   -  How 'bout nine?  -  Sure, that's fine   -  Even ten?  -  Let's say ten then   -  Ooh, 11  -  Still sounds like heaven   -  Maybe 12?  -  Girl, help yourself   -  Then there's 13  -  Couldn't hurt-teen   TINA: One, two, three, more!  The right number of boys for you   Is four, forever."
"1  Alright, another quarter, let's roll  Oh yeah!  I think all of this should be enough for the dune buggy  - No need to count it. - Well, I believe you.  Unfortunately, Family Funtime policy  says we have to count all tickets.  - Oh, come on Trip, is it? - Yup.  You know me.  I mean, you don't, but look at this face.  87. Not quite enough for the dune buggy,  but you can still afford lots of neat stuff,  like this comb that only hurts a little  or this ring that lights up if you buy a battery for it.  Nice try. Give me the tickets.  - Look at her, boys. - Yeah. (whistles)  That's the dune buggy that's gonna save us from this life.  How'd you guys do?  I got ten tickets playing the basketball game.  I didn't get a lot of shots in, but I got a ton of rebounds.  Well, not a ton. Two.  I played a racing game for 45 minutes  before I realized I hadn't put any money in it.  Then I gave all my quarters to a nice man  who gave me a piece of pizza.  Sounds like we need to make a stop at the bank of Mom and Dad.  Are they still around? I thought they got bought out by Chase.  Oh, God. He's here.  What do we do? What do we do?  Maybe we can stall him for six or seven days.  - Good plan. - Hello, Belchers.  Hi, Mr. Fischoeder. What could you possibly want  a week after the first of the month?  Oh, just somebody to talk to, I guess.  Aw, I'll talk to you.  - I'm kidding! - Oh.  Pay your rent, please.  Money. We need money.  Ooh, that's why I'm here.  We're money twins.  That's what I call my testicles.  Gene. Why do you kids need more money?  We just gave you your allowance this morning.  We're trying to win the dune buggy at Family Funtime.  Oh Family Funtime.  That D-bug's got our name written all over it.  And we're gonna be the D-bags driving that D-bug.  Wait, I didn't know we were calling it a D-bug.  Is that still open for discussion?  You guys know those prizes are impossible to win  without spending way more than they're worth, right?  Less talking, more ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching, please.  Are those supposed to be quarter sounds?  They ain't dimes, bub.  All right, I've got nine quarters,  so that's dollars.  That's all you get. For your life.  - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bless you, Father.  Huh. Now, Bob, I believe it's my turn?  Okay. We can let the car leak that stuff a little longer.  Yeah, it's just oil. Comes out of the ground, right?  It's like it's going back home.  Incoming! Beep-beep.  You know, children, there are certain ways  of coaxing the games into giving out more tickets.  Maybe I could teach you kids some tricks  that I've picked up over the years.  - We're listening. - Wait, we are?  You'd be doing me a favor  putting an end to that ridiculous dune buggy promotion.  I don't know. It kind of sounds like you're talking about cheating.  Not cheating.  It's more like insider gaming.  - What's your game? - Johnny Snow Balls.  Ah, yes. A little tip. Aim for the Matterhorn.  Okay, thanks, Mr. Fischoeder.  I've been playing Johnny Snow Balls for 20 years.  I know every inch of that game,  and the Matterhorn's not where the party's at.  Just give it a try. That's all I'm saying.  Okay  Bob, Linda, great news.  You know how you're always going on and on  about how you love fresh farmer's market eggs?  Um, you mean that one time, like, two weeks ago?  - There you go again, on and on. - Mm-hmm.  What would you say if I told you you could have farm fresh eggs  any time you want for practically free?  - I guess that sounds - I don't know.  Great! 'Cause I got a chicken and a coop  in the back of my truck. And 4,000 double ""A"" batteries,  but that's not part of this.  - Why do you have a chicken? - I was building a fence for a guy.  Pretty classic story.  He runs out of cash, pays me with a chicken.  W-Wait, why don't you want it, Teddy?  - My cats would kill it. - Cats? You have cats?  - Someday, when I'm ready. - I-I-I don't know.  Do we really want to take care of a chicken?  - Yes, you do. - I think we do.  Aren't they messy and stinky?  Bob, our kids are messy and stinky,  and we take care of them.  And they don't even give us eggs.  All right.  - I do like fresh eggs. - Yay!  Only problem I can imagine is you're gonna have too many eggs.  Right? Uh oh, here's an idea.  We can all have breakfast together every Sunday. Huh?  - Probably not. - Yeah, no.  Sleep on it. We'll circle back when you're feeling a little more grateful  about this chicken I gave you out of the goodness of my heart.  Back again already, huh?  Yeah, and this time we're leaving with the dune buggy.  That's fun. I always say I'm going to leave with my dignity,  but it never happens.  Now, remember, eyes on the prize. Ticket games only.  No video games, no pizza, no ball pit.  - Darn it. - Got it.  Time for the avalanche.  All right, what the hell?  I'll try your Matterhorn.  Yeah, that's what I  Holy crap.  - Gene, Tina, get over here. - How did you do that?  - Watch this. - But that's gonna go straight into t  From the gutter to the big time,  just like the plastic bag from American Beauty.  Guys, if we just keep hitting the super bonus,  we can actually win the Huh?  Sorry, kids. This game's out of order.  What? You can't do that.  If a machine starts awarding too many tickets,  Family Funtime policy says we got to have it inspected.  It's for your protection.  You're the one who's gonna need protection, pal.  - Easy, girl. - He's not worth it.  If Family Funtime's not gonna play fair,  then it's time for us to go Fisch-ing.  I don't understand. Why would we go fishing?  I think she means we're gonna  steal people's identities on the Internet.  No. We're gonna go see Mr. Fischoeder.  Okay, that makes more sense.  You've made a wise decision coming to me, children.  Two questions. One, are you ready  - to own your own dune buggy? - Yes. - Mm-hmm.  Good. And, two, does this make me look younger?  - Yes, and also like a cheetah. - Thought so.  Why are you upset?  You got a beef with Family Funtime?  No, I don't mind a little friendly competition  with the Family Funtime Corporation,  but this dune buggy stunt goes too far.  It's putting the whole prize economy in danger.  The D-bug is putting the prize e-con in day day?  Yep. If they start giving out dune buggies,  then I have to start giving out dune buggies.  And what's next, moon buggies?  Let me show you something.  Now, this this is the most coveted prize at Wonder Wharf,  the Wheelie Mammoth.  Yeah, we know.  Everyone knows the Wheelie Mammoth.  - He's famous. - But so down-to-earth.  All you have to do to win him is sink a ball into the golden can.  Yeah, but it's an impossible shot.  Not impossible.  The mouth of the can is exactly as wide as the ball.  Technically, it can be forced through. Show 'em.  But no one's ever won, not once.  That mammoth has been at Wonder Wharf with me  since actual mammoths roamed the Earth.  He's my most beloved and most asbestos-filled employee.  In two more years, that's what Dad'll say about me.  Mm-hmm. The big prizes have to be just good enough  to get people to play. They're about hope.  That's what keeps people coming back, you see.  The Wheelie Mammoth isn't even worth any real money.  If a prize is too valuable, like the dune buggy,  the whole system breaks down.  People start searching for any flaws they can exploit.  And then perfectly good games have to be taken out of service.  A boom box with a built-in,  three-inch television and all these games ended up here.  - Whoa. - Whoa.  A secret arcade.  It's exactly how I always imagined Craig Kilborn's garage.  Wait a minute, Family Funtime has a bunch of these games.  Exactly. That's how you're going to win.  I'm going to teach you how to beat these games.  But, first, you need to assemble a crew.  We are a crew. We're preassembled.  - Yeah. I think the Belchers have got this. - Here's the thing.  The only way to knock over Family Funtime  is to do it in one shot.  Hit 'em before they know what hit 'em.  - Like a bris. - Precisely.  It's a complex job that will require some special skills.  - What kind of skills? Plumbing? - No.  - Microsoft Excel? - No.  - Oh, phew. - All right, we're in.  Great. You look like a boy who isn't afraid  of getting his hands a little sticky.  I've heard of washing hands. Doesn't seem like it's for me.  You're on Bucket-Ball.  You, you look like you could shake something back and forth.  Thank you?  You're on the Tipsy Tulip. Now, you just need the hammer  Hey, Zeke. My locker's stuck. Will you do that thing again?  - Yeah. - Uh, that's not my locker.  Oh, yeah.  No. Remember? It's down at the end of the hall?  - Yours is next to mine. - Oh, yeah.  - Zeke. - Huh? What's that?  Do what?  I'm in! Let's go!  - Jimmy Jr., do you have skills? - Yes.  Great. You can come, too.  Next, you'll need a math whiz  with perfect timing.  So, that's how you tutor Pause for a bell  - (Bell rings) - Algebra.  The dune buggy? Oh, I'm in.  And two people who can act  in almost telepathic coordination.  - Why won't it go? - Maybe if we jump on it.  Huh.  We need your help. We're gonna do something.  We're in! This thing's broken, anyway.  Once you've gathered your crew, text me a thumbs-up emoji  and we'll meet back here.  This is your crew?  They don't look like much and they're not much,  but I trust 'em.  Even the two licking each other's hair?  Got to lick something. Okay, listen up, everybody.  You're each gonna be assigned a game.  Then Mr. Fischoeder here is gonna show you how to beat it.  You, the squat one, you're on Whack a Toe.  Did he say squat?  Glasses, you're on The Wheel World.  - Are you gonna learn our names? - God, no.  Creepy twins, you're on the water squirty game.  - That's what we call the toilet. - We've never won.  - You, hot one. - Aw, man.  - You're on Cardiac Arrest. - Okay. It smells weird in here.  Smells weird everywhere, sir.  That's how you know you're alive.  We're gonna need to win 10,000 tickets  without getting noticed by the security guard at the door,  by the manager behind the prize counter,  or the three security cameras located there, there, and there.  The manager watches the room. He also watches the screens.  And that's why he makes the big bucks.  How are we supposed to hide 10,000 tickets?  Leave that part up to me. Now let's get to it.  Clap, clap.  Here we come, chicken, chicken.  Coming for your delicious bottom diamonds.  How many eggs come out at once? Like, a dozen? Two dozen?  Well, it's been three days, so there should be at least a  - Huh. Nothing. - Maybe it's nervous.  You know, like how you can't poop when we travel?  Wait, when did we travel?  Well, I was just imagining, you know.  - If we did, you wouldn't be able to poop. - I could poop.  I'd like to maybe even think I could poop better.  Like, in Europe, I could poop better.  Boo!  - What was that? - I was trying to scare it.  You know, if there was an egg in there about to drop,  I'd scare it out.  I don't think that's how it works.  Well, what's your big idea, Colonel Sanders?  I don't know. Maybe the opposite of what you just did?  - Maybe sing to it? - Ooh, singing! Yes, yes, yes!  Make an egg roll   -  From your egg hole  - No, no, no.  - That's really loud. - That was good.  She doesn't like that kind of singing.  - Why? - She likes this.  Amazing Grace   How sweet   No, no, no, you're putting her to sleep.  Make an egg roll from your egg hole   -  That saved  -  We're gonna beat it   -  A wretch  -  And then we'll eat it   Zeke, how's it coming on Whack a Toe?  Well, I'm working on this move.  Mallet! Head! Mallet, head, go! Mallet!  - Does that hurt? - Does what hurt?  Oh, they're not real toes. They don't feel pain.  Okay. Darryl, how's the Wheel World going?  Are you mastering the pattern?  Yup. The light rotates in a specific algorithm,  depending on where it starts.  Once you spot the pattern, you just wait for the final loop  and then three, two, one, hee-ya!  - So that's math, huh? - Hmm.  Andy, Ollie, show me what you got.  I've got an innie, he's got an outie.  They fit together.  - I meant the game. - Oh.  Nice work. Twice as nice  if you can do it a hundred more times.  Oh, that's a lot.  - Hey, Tina, how's it shaking? - Pretty much like this.  - That's it, huh? - Yeah, that's it.  Can I switch to a different Oh.  Okay, talk to you later.  Saturday is the busiest day  for birthday parties at Family Funtime.  That means their staff is gonna be too busy  to go around pulling plugs on you.  But we're gonna have to keep our ticket count under wraps.  So, remember, when your backpack is full,  slide it through the curtain to me  in the photo booth and I'll empty it out.  We know, Louise. We've been practicing all day.  Can we go home now?  Yeah, everything's starting to look like a toe to me.  - There's one! - Ow, Zeke!  All right, fine. Go home and rest up.  Big day tomorrow. Keep it to one nightcap, hmm?  One jigger of gin per pound of body weight.  You guys head on home.  I'm gonna stop by Family Funtime real quick,  do a final walk-through, check all the sight lines.  I don't know, Louise. We're supposed to be laying low.  - Sounds kind of risky. - Yeah, well, I don't want  to leave anything to chance. Relax. Go home.  I'll be back before Gene eats his first dinner.  It's not a dinner It's a cheese course.  Okthings are looking good here.  Dune buggy's still there, games are all in service,  photo booth is Wait, what the  What's up with the curtain on the photo booth?  It's-it's missing.  Eh, it's at the cleaners.  It can only absorb so much vomit  before the smell becomes a problem.  It'll be back in a few days.  A few days?  You really like that curtain, huh?  Yeah, what can I say, I'm a kid.  And, uh, kids, uh, they love curtains.  He he, sure, sure.  Back in my day, it was blinds.  Damn it, now we need somewhere else to stash the tickets.  I've got to find a blind spot.  Hey, uh, I think  someone tried to flush a Skee-Ball down the toilet.  At least, I hope it's a Skee-Ball.  Oh! To what end, people?  Come on, show me a blind spot.  Hey! You're not allowed behind the prize counter. lo  Unless, I was looking for the staircase.  Oh! There it is.  Nice try.  Yuli, we've got a thief.  Turn. Ra  Now your picture goes up on the Bulletin Board of Banishment  so myself and the other security guards will make sure  you are not admitted into Family Funtime ever again,  again, again  I'm doing that echo thing for dramatic purposes.  - Yep. - Time to get out, out, out  All right, I'm going.  She'll land on her feet. Or turn to drugs and crime.  - What's the emergency? - Look, here's what happened.  - We were - We? No, you.  You blew it. You got caught.  Louise got banned from Family Funtime.  What? You got banned?  I was checking to make sure everything was smooth  for tomorrow, which it wasn't.  I had to find a new place to stash the tickets.  So I smartly went behind the prize counter  And she got caught. The manager thought  she was trying to steal prizes.  Reckless, that's the word.  Also selfish and dumb.  People, if I hadn't gone last night,  this who thing would've fallen apart.  Whoa. Everybody, just slow down, okay?  Take a deep breath and a slug of bourbon.  We'll find a way to sneak Louise into Family Funtime.  I don't know. I hate to say it, Louise,  but I think maybe it's safer if you stay behind.  Sorry, Louise, I guess you're out of the crew.  Yeah, well, g-good luck pulling this off without me.  Crew you guys. Crew all of you!  Hmm.  Hmm, I guess someone else will have to be tiny and bossy.  Uh, what about you? What've you got?  I can smile.  Never mind. What about you?  - I know how everybody's gonna die. - Okay, forget it.  - Still hasn't laid an egg, huh? - No.  What kind of chicken did you give us, Teddy?  It's a poor craftsman who takes it out on his chicken, Bob.  Linda, no! She's young! She hasn't figured it out yet.  Teddy, I'm just holding a knife.  - We work in a restaurant. - Oh.  But have I thought about eating chicken?  Yes. Yes, I have.  I've got a few recipes bookmarked.  - Yeah. Me, too. - Stop! You people are monsters.  Rosemary chicken,  - barbeque chicken sandwich - Oh!  - Garlic chicken - Oh!  - Yum. - That sounds good, actually.    Oh, no, my hands are all sticky.  And now the ball is all sticky.  That's weird.  Yeah! I mean Yeah.  Ooh, ooh. That's my whistle sound.  I don't know how to whistle, Tina.  Don't think about all the pee in here.  Don't think about all the pee in here.  Don't think about all the pee in here.  Uh-oh.  Dang! You come out of there.  I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.  Jeepers. How many tickets do you kids have in here?  The normal amount?  I can't believe you kids would cheat.  It's called Family Funtime,  not H-Horrible Greedy Children Cheat Time.  What?! We were playing totally fair. Like, maybe too fair.  Ah, well, we'll see what the boss says about that.  Here he is now.  Hello, children.  Mr. Fischoeder? What are you doing here?  Oh, did I forget to mention?  I'm part owner of Family Funtime.  Yeah, I think you did.  Wait, Mr Fischoeder  to cheat at your own arcade?  I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.  Anyway, these are the types of cheaters I was worried about  Grubby, grubby little ones. Sorry, I'm being rude.  Uh, this is one of my so-called partners.  We're actual partners, not so-called partners.  None of the partners like it when you call them  so-called partners.  They were about to try and claim the dune buggy.  It's a good thing I was expecting this  and was able to catch them.  But you taught us to cheat.  Yeah, you did. Are you dirty dogging us?  I've never seen you before in my long and prosperous life.  Well, you were right about this, Calvin.  That dune buggy is a liability.  It's too valuable. If it can be won here,  it can be won at all of our participating locations.  Wh-What's gonna happen to the dune buggy?  I guess I'll drive it back to the office.  Thank God we built it next to those dunes.  Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.  Looks like things went pretty smoothly, huh?  Yeah. Piece of cake.  - How'd it go on your end? - I nailed it.  What are you kids talking about? Why are you being chummy?  Why aren't you distraught?  You're not supposed to be here. You're banned.  Yeah, little breakdown in security.  - There's no one out there. - Oh, shoot, that's me.  I'll go back out, you try to walk in again.  Hold on. I would like to know what's happening here.  Well, you see, Mr. F, it was yesterday,  while Yuli was taking that very flattering picture of me,  that I realized you were setting us up.  And how, pray tell, did you realize that so not true thing?  Because right next to the Bulletin Board  of Banishment is a really fun collection of pictures  from the Family Funtime company picnic.  Damn it. Good picnic, though. Great punch.  When I saw that, I realized there was no way  we were getting that dune buggy.  After I broke the news to the crew,  we all agreed we weren't going to walk away  from this empty-handed.  So while this decoy heist was underway,  the real heist was going on at the wharf.  - My wharf? - Yup.  We pulled a heist of our own to win the unwinnable.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, not  My Wheelie Mammoth?  But how did I d I don't What the ? It's unwinnable.  - Thanks to you, it became winnable. - What?  Turns out you taught us everything we needed to know  to land us a mammoth.  Sticky hands.  Timing.  Shaking.  And the hammer.  - Yes! Yes! Yes! - Ah! She got it in!  She got it in! Somebody won the mammoth!  How come no one's excited but me?  So, while we may not be taking home the dune buggy  Sorry! I didn't know how loud it was gonna be.  Is it loud there? It's loud here.   we did get the next best thing:  the most coveted prize in all of Wonder Wharf.  Well played.  Well played, all of you.  I'm going to miss that mammoth.  Do me a favor, brush him every once in a while, will you?  And oil his wheels. I never did any oi that stuff,  but I always meant to.  Come on, so-called partner, let's race.  Yeah, ha, ha!  Son of a gun, look at him go.  Wait, let's trade!  - You really think this is gonna work? - No.  Well, it can't hurt, anyway. We tried everything else.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God, guys, look.  Whoa.  Half Wheelie Mammoth, half chicken.  All frittata.  Sheesh. Remember how easy it was to buy eggs?  I miss that. I miss us.  I wonder if Teddy knows any other suckers  who would take a chicken.  And maybe a mammoth, too?  You bite your tongue.  That mammoth is part of the family now.  Louise, it's huge.  - Where are we gonna put it? - Right there.  But we can't see the TV.  This is what we watch now.  We watch mammoth and chicken.  Yeah, okay.  So are we gonna eat that mamma-jamma or what?  I-I mean the egg, not the chicken. Or the mammoth.  I know ""mamma-jamma"" sounded like a fun way  to say ""mammoth,"" but I didn't mean it that way.  - But I am hungry. - All right!  Who wants to split a one-egg omelet five ways?  Wheelie Mammoth   The most famous guy in town   If wooly mammoths had had wheels   Maybe they'd still be around   Ooh!   Wheelie Mammoth   Look at him go   Wheelie Mammoth wooly   Wheelie Mammoth wheelie"
"1    Calculator, check. Business casual barrette, check.  Um, has anyone seen my laser pointer?  - I borrowed it. Gene, look. - (grunting excitedly)  Stop it, Louise. Your brother's not a cat.  I got it, I got it! Oh.  - That's my boy. - That was fun. I'm done.  Tina, what's with all the business stuff?  Today's the first day of Tweentrepreneurs,  the Wagstaff small business class.  We all signed up.  Oh, yeah, my little business babies.  Kids form an actual start-up  to design, make and sell our own new product.  We're like Elon Musk Tina being the muskiest.  Well, I think it's great to learn  about being an entrepreneur.  I mean, when I think back  on when we started the restaurant,  we didn't have two nickels.  The second one rolled under the fridge.  - You were so mad. - But what we did have  was a promise we made to our customers  - and ourselves - Oh, boy, here we go.   that we'd never compromise on quality.  Never, never, never, never ever.  So sometimes, then?  No, Gene, never ever.  Hey, uh, do you guys want me to speak to your class?  - About what? - Oh, Dad.  Um, I will definitely put that out there.  - Really? - Uh-huh.  Because it kind of sounds like you're not going to.  - No, it doesn't. - Forget it.  Whew. Oh, thank God.  Entrepreneurship is no walk in the park.  One day you have a thriving Etsy business  selling hand-knitted Doctor Who scarves,  the next, a PBS lawyer sends you a cease and desist letter  that practically threatens to break your fingers.  PBS will get you, boy. Don't poke that hornet's nest.  Now you will all present ideas and choose one for production.  And don't say Melrose Place mats.  That's another long story.  LOUISE: So, then the metal tapers down from the handle  to this end here.  I call it the Pointy Pal.  - That's a knife, Louise. - Yeah.  This roasted nut recipe  is my own blend of herbs and spices.  It's called Zeke's Hot Nut Sack.  What?  You need your asthma medicine,  but you don't want to attract looks.  Solution? Inhaler Hider.  (strained, gasping breath)  (hoarsely): No one will know.  It's a clown nose for horses.  Why should they miss out on all the fun?  One day Zeke wasn't around, and I was bored.  - ZEKE: Lonely? - No, more bored.  - ZEKE: Sad? - No.  Anyway, I saw a chunk of wood,  and I thought, ""Hey, that's almost as good.""  So I made Wood Chuck.  That wood has eyes. I love it.  Is it weird that I kind of want it to like me?  Wooden yet cuddly. Step aside, Josh Hartnett.  Looks like Wood Chucks it is.  Great. Now, as you set up your company, remember,  you kids are in charge, not me.  - So like always? - Hmm.  Jimmy Jr. should be president  because he did invent Wood Chuck.  I should be vice president of sales  because people literally cannot say no to me.  - Let me try. N - Mm-mm.  - Don't do it. - I can't do it.  Hey, I'll be the executive  in charge of sitting on corners of desks,  keeping the mood light. Who needs a nickname?  - How about you, Side Pony? - Hmm.  Doesn't somebody have to make them?  Oh, yeah, you got to saw the wood, sand it, stain it,  stick on the googly eyes just right  Ew. So you and you and you and you can do that.  - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - (school bell rings)  Job well done. I mean, my job.  You guys are just getting started.  Hey, there's a plate  we don't need to wash. Ha!  I mean, we will. We always do. Eventually.  - Everything was so good. - Aw, thank you.  Here you go. No rush.  Uh, excuse me, did you say ""no rush""?  Yeah, whenever you're ready, hon.  - Well, then, I guess that would be - Yeah?  - Never! - (Linda gasps)  - A dine-and-dasher! Bob! - Oh, my God!  - How big a check? - $7.50 plus tip. He liked me.  - There would have been a tip. - That's  Never mind. I'm gonna get him.  - LINDA: Go! - Bob's chasing him.  Go, Bob, g Oh, Bob gave up.  Now he's walking back.  Now he's stopping to rest.  (out of breath): He got away. It all happened so fast.  It happened kind of fast.  What, I should have caught him? He had a huge head start.  Maybe spend a little less time fooling with your apron.  I can't run with it on, Teddy.  Can't run so good with it off, either.  Well, someone else could have chased him, too, right?  I was busy memorizing his face.  Ooh, what'd you get? I'll make a sketch.  Well, I was startled, so I didn't get much.  - Definitely two eyes. - Okay.  - Uh, what about a nose? - Yeah, right in between the eyes  - and down a little. - Yeah, that checks out.  That's the guy I saw, too.  Oh, my God.  (sneezes)  Wow, that sawdust really travels back  into the old respiratory system.  (wheezing): But smooth.  Yeah, sawdust with a stain chaser.  At least there's no ventilation.  This job stinks.  Each smile I draw is a lie, a damn lie!  Well, the first batch is done.  Now it's time to turn these Chucks into bucks.  Sales: the real work.  I'll take one.  - I want one, too. - You're gonna live with me now.  - Take our money. - You and I are great at this.  I know.  Wood Chucks making bucks   Wood Chucks making bucks   We're making Wood Chucks and we're making bucks   Making bucks.   100 Wood Chucks sold. Wow!  And we all worked our B's off.  Yeah, like when Zeke brought in cupcakes for Jocelyn's birthday.  We worked overtime to finish eating them.  (laughs) Not really.  TINA: Hey, are there any Band-Aids over here?  Oh, um, is something going on?  We celebrated all our sales  by investing our profits in a SodaSpurt thingy.  And we didn't want to invite I mean, um, disturb you guys  'cause you seemed really in the zone just making Wood Chucks.  Do you see spots in the zone? If you do,  - then I'm definitely in the zone. - Quick question.  - What's going on - (soda fizzes)  - What - (soda fizzes)  - What (groans) - (soda fizzes)  - What Damn it, Jocelyn! - (soda fizzes)  What? I'm trying to make it fizzy.  I was doing my job.  What's with these cubicles?  You literally boxed us in back there.  TAMMY: We tried the open floor plan.  It just wasn't working.  We don't want to get sawdust in our soda.  Okay, it just feels like you're creating a division  with these divisions.  I mean, it's nice not having to see Tammy anymore, but  Oh, I'm sorry, it's hard to hear you from the other room.  I'm so sorry.  Boy, I really could use a  (wheezing): dust mask.  (sighs) If every other class  wasn't literally worse than a sweatshop,  I'd transfer out of here so fast.  Mr. Frond, do you think we could switch jobs soon?  Oh, sure, Tina, we'll just switch jobs.  Like people never get stuck  in the same job their whole career.  I'm gonna go talk to those guys. This is ridiculous.  - Can I help you? - I need to see Jimmy Jr.  He's, like, super busy in a meeting or something.  Why don't you tell me what it is, and I will tell him.  Fine. We need dust masks and Band-Aids and gloves  and a timetable on when we'll be switching jobs.  So you're crabby. Did I get it all?  - (groans) - Hey!  You bought snacks, too?  No, just chips and chocolate-covered almonds  and a second kind of chocolate-covered almonds.  Look, it seems like the sanders and stainers  are doing all the frickin' work  while management sits on their damn butts.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, language. NSFW, girl.  Huh. Maybe Tina has a point.  - We should take turns. - What? Hold up.  - Tina, have an almond. - I don't want an alm  - Mmm. So - And another.  - Mmm. - One more.  Mmm. Which kind is that?  Let's take a walk.  You are raising some amazing points.  I hope someone's writing them down.  - I wrote them down. - Oopsies. Well, there that went.  So, maybe you could keep all your smarty ideas going  as our new sander and stainer relations manager.  - Manager? - Mm-hmm. You'd be in here.  TINA: This is kind of nice.  Have a seat. The chair is an exercise ball.  - Whoa. - (imitates buzzer)  - Jocelyn, could you bring us two sodas? - JOCELYN: Okay!  Did you just make a buzz sound with your voice?  Mm-hmm, I did. And so can you.  (imitates buzzer)  - Feels good, right? - Yeah.  - Sodas. - (Tammy slurping)  Well, it's what's best for the company, right?  (burps) Exactly.  (slurping)  - I don't believe it. - Me either.  An exercise ball for a desk chair? What's next?  By the way, Rudy, thank you for letting me stand on you.  No problem. (grunts)  And my Scotch tape. And, you know, this cat calendar is mine,  but I think I'm gonna leave it.  Ugh. You're one of them now, Tina.  You're a suit.  And not a fun, frisky suit,  like something Ellen would wear.  Guys, this is a good thing.  I'm gonna be your eyes and ears over there,  looking out for you.  Like, weren't you whining about something, Rudy?  A dust mask. It only sounded like whining  because of my restricted windpipe.  Right, so I guess I'll be going next door now.  Unless, surprise good-bye party? Yes? No?  - You've got to be kidding. - Okay, then.  Let's all stay in touch. You said ""mouse pad.""  - Dust mask! - Right, right, right.  So, in conclusion, we're eating snacks  faster than we're making Wood Chucks.  So, what I hear is we're doing our part.  Yeah, the sanders and stainers got to keep up with us.  Well, if some of us helped out over there  - Whoa. - Um -Do what?  - Uh - I mean, not us.  - Obviously, we're slammed. - So slammed.  Why don't they just make them faster?  How long does it even take to make a dumb Wood Chuck?  Um, like, 20 minutes?  So, if we cut that to ten minutes,  instead of one Chuck, they could make  - Two? - Whoa, math.  I mean, they might have some rough edges,  but it's better than nothing, right?  Yeah, we're all a work in progress, right, J-Ju?  - Get over here, come on. - Aah.  You know, if we cut the ten minutes to  Five minutes?!  So, good talk. I'm going to let you guys  - get crack-a-lacking. - (snaps fingers)  I was ready to be annoyed, but that finger thing was cool.  I don't know if I can go any faster.  My little body is already breaking down.  Well, there's only one thing to do.  - Work harder. - Half-ass it.  Oh-oh, half-ass it.  I don't know, that still sounds like a lot of ass.  So, quarter-ass it is.  Gonna throw just a little bit of my cheek in.  Ooh, quarter-assin'   A little bit of the cheek, a little bit of the cheek   Ooh, quarter-assin'   A little bit of the cheek, a little bit of the cheek   Ooh, quarter-assin'   -  A little bit of the cheek.  - (door bells jingle)  Hey, guys, how was your day? How's Tweentrepreneurs?  - I don't want to talk about it. - (Gene grumbles)  Great. We're pushing a lot of units, making bank.  - How's Bob's Burgers? - Um, excuse me?  Are you making bank? How many units are you pushing?  Tell her you're pushing units. Tell her you're making bank.  Tina, you're-you're not making sense right now.  I know, so business-y.  Let's go, Gene. Smells like ""entre-manure"" in here.  - That was me, but also, yeah. - (door bells jingle)  Okay, Dad, you didn't ask, but here are five things  you could do right now to improve your business.  - Smaller burgers. - Mm-hmm. Mm.  Cook them ahead of time. Keep them warm under a lamp.  - Mm-mm. Mm. - Raise prices.  - Maybe buy a comb? - Mm.  You getting this, Bob? You taking notes?  Tina, you're sounding kind of like a business monster.  I wouldn't say business master, it's just common sense.  I-I said business monster.  Can we circle back on this next week?  I've got to make some calls.  Also, the spinning made me nauseous.  Do you think she'd do our taxes?  Wait, that customer in the booth over there.  I-Isn't that our dine-and-dasher?  I don't think so.  Mm, yeah, he doesn't look much like my sketch.  Yeah, and this guy has a hat.  Well, anyone could put on a hat.  It takes time. You got to find one that's flattering.  - It's not that hard. - This guy,  he thinks he looks good in any hat.  Anyway, we can't just accuse him if we don't know for sure.  That's true. Uh, why don't you go over there  and feel him out a little?  - Be sly. - You kidding?  You're talking to Sly and the Family Stallone.  Hello! So, you look like a busy person.  - You ever eat on the run? - I'm sorry?  You like Christmas carols?  Dashing through the snow.   You like that one? The one about dashing?  - She's great at this. - Uh, is-is something the matter?  All right, we had a dine-and-dasher the other day,  and you look a little bit like him.  - The guy had a hat and everything? - No, no hat.  Oh, well, I can see why you'd be concerned.  (chuckles): But if it was me, I would have to be crazy  to come back, right?  I mean, uh, totally crazy.  (laughs) I'm sorry.  I guess you got one of those faces  where you look like other people, like owls.  - (chuckles) - All owls look the same to me.  - Those big eyes. - (chuckles)  Oh, sure. You know, it's fine.  Oh, hope you enjoyed your meal. Here's your check.  - It's not him. - Aah!  - Okay, it's him. - Damn it!  Hi, guys. Just popping in.  We couldn't finish these next door,  so, naturally, I thought of you.  Oh really, Tina? A third of a muffin?  (gasps) Thank you so much.  It's raisin something or other. It's not good. Anyway,  we've had a ton of complaints about splinters, so  I'm doing my best.  Any progress on my dust mask?  Working on it, Rudy!  What's it gonna take to get more work out of you guys?  I've tried the carrot, I've tried the stick.  And you even tried carrot sticks.  - That was a dark day. - I'm feeling dizzy.  Pull your shirt over your mouth and keep going, Rudy.  Oh, good idea.  Tina, you are this close to a walkout.  Yeah, except walking also sounds like too much work.  Where am I?!  Everything looks like a Wood Chuck!  You broke Rudy, Tina!  Rudy, you're fine!  Why is that Wood Chuck saying I'm fine?!  That's it! We're out. We're on strike.  Wait. What? Hey, we-we-we can work this out.  I think I can get you guys, uh, SodaSpurt privileges.  Maybe-maybe not flavored, but-but still, uh, bubbles.  Put your bubbles in your butt! Come on, guys.  Fine! Where you gonna go with your skills?  One of the other ten Wood Chuck factories in town?  Oh, that's right. We're the only one!  Guys, nobody's buying Wood Chucks anymore.  I didn't make a sales chart, but if I did, it would go like this.  (sputtering)  Yeah. What happened to quality control?  Instead of a cute smile, this one says ""Tina's a butt.""  This isn't Wood Chuck! I wouldn't hang out with this!  TINA: (exhales) Let's not sugarcoat it.  Wood Chuck is dead.  It's a greasy, googly patch on the road.  Dang.  Also, our entire labor force just quit.  But to keep snacks coming, we need product.  So we turn the page to Wood Chuck 2.  Everything kids loved about Wood Chuck 1  in a smaller package we don't even sand.  I've been working on it in secret.  I mean, it only took a minute,  so it wasn't hard to not tell anyone.  Wood Chuck? More like Wood Yuck.  Doesn't matter. It's new. We say it's cool.  Best of all, it sells for half price.  How can we sell it for half price?  By squeezing our suppliers.  EDITH: You got big ones, coming in here,  demanding cut-rate googly eye prices.  Cajones!  You're gonna do it, too, dying mom-and-pop shop,  or I take my business to the craft superstore in Bog Harbor.  Yarn Barn? On the outside, it's shaped like a barn,  but on the inside, it looks like a normal store.  It's ridiculous!  - Well, can't wait to see it. - Yeah, bye.  All right, fine, but if you want bulk prices,  you take bulk quantity.  5,000 googlies, a hundred dollars, no returns!  Gulp. I mean, not gulp. Confident. Can we get them on credit?  Depends. Are you familiar with the concept  of jacked-up interest rates?  - No. - Then sign here.  I don't know, Tina. That's, like, a big risk  on something I still wouldn't hang out with.  I believe in Wood Chuck 2.  I mean, I believe people will buy anything  with a higher number than the model that came before it.  Huh. Should we have called it Wood Chuck Gold Series?  - In wood? - Ooh, I want that.  Mr. Frond, hypothetically, what would happen  if the Tweentrepreneurs had a really big googly eye bill  they couldn't pay?  You'd be bankrupt, which happens. No shame.  - Oh, that's not so bad. - You'd also get an ""F"",  and ""Terrible at business"" would be placed  - on your permanent record. - Oh.  And you're not a real company, so you couldn't  really declare bankruptcy, so you'd have to pay your bill  - or be criminally liable. - Oh, God!  But, Tina, relax. Your question was hypothetical.  Right.  Whoa. Tina burned this crappy company to the ground.  Yeah, where did she go to school?  Oh. Where we do.  Darn it, Tina! It's your fault we're flunking.  Now I'll never get into the Ivan League.  Okay, okay, got a little distracted.  There were so many office birthday parties!  Boy, I don't know what Edith and Harold are gonna do  when you tell 'em you don't have their googly eye money.  I heard Edith put a knitting needle through a man's hand  just because he didn't have exact change.  Well, maybe they'll be super cool about it?  Yeah, I wouldn't count on that.  Ugh  LINDA: It's not our fault we got double dined-and-dashed, Bob.  It's like fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, guess where the shame is now? Still you!  I don't think that's how it goes.  - Hi there. - Oh, my God.  Now this is chutzpah.  I'm going around the neighborhood as a courtesy.  My identical twin brother has been dining and dashing  in restaurants all over town.  Your-your identical twin brother?  Oh, yes Gary. He's a bad seed.  And he makes life very difficult for me, the good seed.  How stupid do you think we are?  Aw, it sounds like he's been here already.  He was. You were!  We're not buying your evil twin brother hooey.  Look, I was trying to do you a favor.  I'm not even here to eat, although  - I am a little bit hungry. - Aha.  Okay, I get it. You don't want to serve me.  I'll tell you what. I'll prepay. Here's $20.  - What can go wrong, huh? - Okay.  That was amazing. (laughs)  - Let's settle up. How much? - Seven dollars.  Great. Let's throw a two-dollar tip on there.  So what does that make now? Nine?  Okay, just give me, uh, nine back from that 20.  - Uh, uh, right. - Nine from 20.  And seven, eight, nine, and we're good.  Wait. I think we did that backwards.  Uh, I-I-I thought something was wrong.  (chuckling): Right, I was supposed to give you the nine.  Sorry. You have my 20. I have your nine.  You're not trying to scam me, are you?  - (laughing): Nah, nah. - (laughs) No, we're not.  Okay, wait, um, so I give you your nine,  and you give me my 20.  Right. No, I Sorry. I got it.  Here we go. Nine back to you, and now we're square.  - Okay. - And bye.  - Hey, watch out for my brother. - (chuckles) We will.  Ugh. Imagine having a brother like that.  Seven, tip makes nine. His 20, my my nine.  Damn it! He came in with 20, he left with 20, Lin.  - He got a free meal. - (gasps)  Both twins are evil. Their poor mother.  So we've opened up this emergency meeting to everyone,  even the kids from the other side of the cardboard.  There's probably a nicer way of saying that.  Oh, now we're invited to the meetings.  When the company's in the toilet and the snacks are gone.  The snacks are gone?!  We got to do something fast.  We're up to our googly eyeballs in debt!  - How bad is it? - That's pretty bad.  Oh, sorry, kids. I didn't see you in here.  Now, how can we raise some cash from these horrible Wood Chucks?  Louise, you want to kick things off  with the perfect idea?  Uh-uh. You guys created this mess, not us.  I will, however, bless this mess.  You'll never unload these things.  You might as well try to sell the whole stupid company.  Yes, that's it! Unload the whole company  on some unsuspecting fool.  Ugh! I didn't mean to give you a real idea.  - Ugh, but who? - Yeah. Ha-ha.  Good luck finding your fool.  You think the streets are crawling with Teddys?  - Aha! - No, I did it again!  So what's this investment opportunity?  - Spoiler alert. I want in. - Good.  I've never gotten in on the ground floor of anything.  I always chickened out. Not this time.  Okay, this is our product.  Don't know what this is, and there's a big splinter in my hand.  Not gonna let that bother me.  By the way, we're not telling my mom and dad about you investing.  That raises red flags,  like maybe I shouldn't be doing this.  But I'm gonna quash that feeling so I don't miss out.  - Let's do it. - LOUISE: Ah, Tina.  - There you are. - So you weren't going out  - to look at the foliage. - Teddy,  don't invest; the company's a stinker.  (quietly): Go away, you guys.  Teddy, I'm warning you, you'd be wasting your money.  You got to waste money to make money.  - Teddy! - You're Bob's kid,  and if your company is anything like Bob's Burgers,  I know I'm getting in on something special.  So here's my hundred dollars.  (groaning)  LOUISE: I think that's the sound of your soul leaving your body.  Teddy, I can't do it. Louise is right.  The company is crap. We make a dangerous, worthless product.  - Like shampoo. - Companies have growing pains.  - Perfectly normal. - Don't you get it?  I was conning you. I'm a business monster.  Wow. I don't know what to say, except that kind of honesty  I've never believed in you more than right now.  Take your money back, damn it!  I'm just gonna give you more, Tina!  Teddy did not want to take that money back.  We did what we had to do.  Then everybody was staring, like they'd never seen  three kids holding a crying man down,  shoving money in his pants.  I'm really sorry, guys.  I don't know what got into me before.  All I saw were dollar signs and snacks.  You flew too close to the Sun Chips.  You know, I think I'd rather be a good bad businessperson,  like Dad, than a bad good businessperson.  Does that make sense?  Is this one of those riddles  where it turns out you're your own son?  Gene, I-I think you sat on some googly eyes.  That's okay, I'm used to eyes on my butt.  Oh, my God, guys.  We never should have made Wood Chucks in the first place.  We should have made  - Could Chucks. - Do what Chucks?  Yeah, I'm not fol I don't I'm not following this.  ""Could Chucks,"" 'cause they could be anything.  Googly eyes can go anywhere.  Like Phone Chuck?  Inhaler Chuck.  - Zeke Chuck. - (laughs)  We can sell them for 25 cents a pair,  pay off our debt to Reflections,  and still make a small profit.  Well, let's get to selling, people.  But there's one thing we got to do first.  - Tear down these walls! - Whoa, whoa.  But then it will look like you're as good as me.  Oh, you're still vice president, Tammy.  - Oh, phew. - The rest of us are presidents.  What?!  LINDA: So, you sold off  all your googly eyes,  paid off Edith and Harold, and broke even?  - Yep. - Aw.  I'm proud of my Tweentrepreneurs.  And Mr. Frond gave us a B-minus.  Oh, my God, a B-minus? That's a Belcher A.  And I saved two googlies so I can put 'em on my bosom,  and I can say, ""My eyes are down here!""  - (door bells jingle) - Hi. It's me.  (gasps) Unbelievable.  - I-I know, I know. - You see?  This is why we need a net from the ceiling.  So when things like this happen,  we could drop a net from the ceiling.  No, please. I did it, I'm sorry.  But your food is so good.  I've never hit a place three times.  Honestly, it's a compliment.  You robbed us three times. That's not a compliment.  Look, here's all the money I owe you, I just  I want to be able to come here as a real customer.  (chuckles) You want to be a real customer?  I'm tired of dashing, Bob. Can we start over?  (sighs) All right, ground rules.  You sit on this stool, away from the door  - and cash register. - You don't touch anything.  Louise and Gene are gonna duct tape your hands and your feet.  That seems fair. No problem.  I don't even know what's happening,  - but I love it. - Pay first.  Push your wallet across the counter with your face.  And don't talk while we make change.  In fact, we're not even making change, it's all tip.  I say we do this for all our customers now.  We'll feed you your burger.  Hi, I'm Tina. I'll be your feeder today.  Would you like me to pretend your food  -is some sort of airplane or train? - Train, please.  TINA: You're a good businessman, Dad.  BOB: Thank you, Tina.  She's a business monster, a business monster   Pushing units and making bank   She's a business monster, a business monster   Her cardboard office is totally swank   She's pounding soda, living on snacks   She'll talk about it later, she'll circle back   She's a business monster, a business monster   Walking around like her crap don't stank   She's a business monster, a business monster."
"1  No! What are you doing?  Make it look scary. Better.  So what's that supposed to be?  An ugly ghost or something?  - It's a mummy. - Mm. Looks like an ugly ghost.  I spent all weekend on it.  You know what, leave it there. It's, uh, terrifying.  O-Okay.  I love how Ocean Avenue's gonna be  pedestrian only on Halloween.  We only have to trick-or-treat on one street and we live on it.  Yeah, the only thing easier would be if everyone  just dumped candy in a bucket outside the door.  Bill, bill, bill. Ooh, catalogue.  And I'm a little old to trick-or-treat, but damn,  I got to get me some Sticky Sugar-Booms.  Sticky Sugar-Booms? What are Sticky Sugar-Booms?  A new candy/reason for living.  It's the ""it"" candy this year.  You chomp it and the syrup reacts with the fizzy stuff  and it explodes in your mouth. Boom.  And you know the store owners  are gonna give out the good stuff  'cause they're so desperate for business.  Looking at you, Dad.  Did you get the Sticky Sugar-Booms?  Oh, no, I got these really good hard candies, though.  Everyone loves hard candies, right?  Yeah, yeah They're the b-best?  Yeah, I mean, these were my grandfather's favorite,  Dr. Peter's Bitter Drops.  They aren't too sweet, you know?  And, by the way, we're not desperate for business.  Eh, we are.  All right, we are, but this will be good.  Lots of people coming in here,  maybe people who've never been in before.  For Bitter Drops?  And for the ghosts. Your mother hung ghosts.  I mean, she's going to.  I hung the string. I can't find the ghosts.  Hey, here's a flyer from your dentist.  Dr. Yap is offering to pay you a dollar a pound  for your Halloween candy.  Why the hell would we do that?  We worked for that sugar, girl!  Plus, buying candy is exactly what we'd do  with money the second we got any.  Yeah, money is just candy that hasn't been born yet.  Hey, Teddy, how you doing?  Good. I-I mean, okay, maybe,  or maybe not.  What's going on?  Well, you know that candle place next door?  Those Who Can, Dle.  Horrible name. I don't even understand it.  Yeah, well, they hired a handyman  to set out their Halloween decorations out front.  Oh, yeah, I think I saw that guy.  He's got two legs, two arms?  That's him, all right. Yup.  His name is Glenn. The guy's always  beating me out for jobs.  His hook is he's the ""smell nice handyman.""  Ooh, I like that. Not that you're not that.  Yeah, no, you smell incredible all the time.  Like baby powder and-and peanut butter.  Yeah, well, I kind of told him, ""Hey, that's funny.  ""I got hired next door at Bob's  to decorate the front of their place for Halloween.""  Uh-huh, but you didn't.  - No, right. No, I know. - Right.  Okay, so hear me out: if you let me,  I'll do your decorations for free  if you just pretend-hire me, right?  So I can shove it right in Glenn's stupid, nice-smelling,  stupid face, right?  How's that smell, Glenn?  He's just so damn competent.  I just want to step on his neck a little bit, you know?  - Whoa. - Yikes.  - Yeah. - Okay, fine, Teddy, you can decorate  the front of the restaurant if you want.  - Yay! - Oh, thanks a lot. That's great.  How's that spider coming along, Teddy?  It's coming along wonderfully, Glenn.  Than you very much. How's your so-called bat?  My bat is spectacular. Thanks for asking.  Nice ladder, by the way.  Thank you. I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.  Oh, I was, and now I realize  that we have the same ladder,  so maybe now I'm being sincere.  So we both agree these are great ladders.  Is this the right tone of voice to be saying that,  you idiot on a nice ladder?  Oh, yeah, this is a great tone of voice, except shut up!  Yeah, you shut up! Besides, I can't hear you  over all the work I'm doing over here.  I'm doing more work! Work, work  Work, work, work, work  - Work. - Work good, smell better.  That's what I say.  Can I open my eyes yet?  I want to see my babies in their costumes.  We've been ready for five minutes.  - We're waiting for you. - Oh, look at you!  Who are you dressed as?  I'm AndrÃ© 3000 the Giant.  Oh, so fresh and so Gene.  Who are you, Louise?  I'm a dragon with a girl tattoo.  - Ooh, you flipped the script. - What do you mean?  And what are you, Tina?  I'm Nun of Your Business.  Okay. Geez, touchy.  No, Lin, that's her costume.  Do you seriously not get it?  No, I got it. I-I got it.  What-what is it then?  She's a nun. She's a cranky nun.  What about the briefcase?  Well, that's why she's cranky.  She's got a lot of work to do.  Hey, Teddy.  - Cool costume? - Yeah.  I thought if I was gonna be working out here  on Halloween night, I should probably blend in.  I didn't want to look weird, Bob.  Uh-huh. How you doing on the decorations?  Great. I'm almost done.  Just because it's definitely not before Halloween anymore.  It is Halloween, you know?  Kids are trick-or-treating all over the place right now.  But look at that spider and that web! Ooh, scary!  Isn't the spider scary, kids?  Sure is.  That spider makes me think, ""Whoa. No way.""  Yeah, took a lot of work, but, hey,  when you nail it, you nail it.  Holy crap. His flies?  It's flying all over the place.  - That's amazing! - It looks so real.  That's better than real. That's better than bats.  - Yours doesn't move? - No, it doesn't move at all.  God, it's like something out of da Vinci's sketchbook.  Uh I know a guy.  I-I can go get a motor, a-a servo.  This spider's gonna be crawling all over the place.  - I'll be right back. - Yup.  Happy Halloween!  That's entertainment, am I right?  Glenn!  - Ooh, he does smell good. - All the way from here.  Ooh, I got some Sticky Sugar-Booms.  - Nice. - Me, too.  They're gonna be the second best booms I drop today.  Kerplunk!  I can't open my mouth at all,  but it's so good.  Yup. I can feel the flavor seeping into my teeth.  Good-bye, teeth.  -  Trick or treat  -  Ooh   -  Sticky sweets  -  Ah   -  Messin' up  -  Ooh   -  All my teeth  -  Ah   -  Trick or treat  -  Ooh   -  Sticky sweets  -  Ah   Feel the flavor seeping into my teeth   You can eat the wrappers, right?  Cut out the middleman?  Oh, hey, Jimmy Jr. Zeke.  - That-That's loud. - Hey, Tina.  So you're trick-or-treating, huh? We're not.  You could say we're more into the trick part this year.  That's loud.  Yeah, mischief.  Oh, that one didn't explode, but you get the point.  So much mischief.  We're gonna go to Mutilation Mansion  at Wonder Wharf later.  I heard they jump out and grab you.  They really shake you.  - Come on. Like this. Come on. - Zeke, ow.  And they look all mutilated.  Tina, you should go. It's fun.  Mm, I don't think so.  Mutilation Mansions kind of freak me out.  Duh. That's the point.  Yeah, Tina, you don't go to Mutilation Mansion  to relax and unwind.  It's not a spa.  You guys are idiots. I'm getting candy.  Mayday! SOS!  Whoa, Andy, Ollie, are you okay?  - No, our candy got stolen. - By a devil!  Your candy got stolen by an actual devil?  I guess it could've been a human in a devil costume,  but our bags are gone!  Sounds like punk teens being punks. Sorry, guys.  That really sucks.  Hey, has any one seen an astronaut running through here?  We have astro-not. Why?  'Cause that astronaut stole my bag of candy.  - For real? - Who are you dressed as, by the way?  Paul Rudd in I Love You, Man.  - Oh, it's, um - Iconic? Yeah.  My candy! My candy! My beautiful candy!  Oh, no! You, too?  Who took yours, a devil or an astronaut?  Neither. It was a hockey goalie with a knife.  Do you mean Jason from Friday the 13th?  You know I don't like scary movies!  What's going on?  There are monsters out there,  and they want our candy.  It's a war on Halloween.  Newt Gingrich warned us about this.  Okay, let's go over what we know.  We have four innocent kids' candy stolen  right from their hands.  By a bunch of teens dressed up  like a devil, an astronaut,  and a goalie named Jason.  He's not a goalie, but whatever.  Trick or treat.  Frikkin' teens.  Why can't they just stick to scaring each other  down at Wonder Wharf?  I know. Teens are the cause of nine out of ten things.  Guys, I really don't want my candy to get stolen.  Should we drop ours off at home?  No, no, no, no. We'd be wasting  valuable candy time walking there.  Teens.  More trick than treat this year, huh?  - Do what? - What are you talking about?  You know damn well what we're talking about.  Let's give them something to talk about.  How about love?  There's a group of teens stealing kids' candy.  You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?  Hm, hm? Would you?  Easy there, Sister Mary Yellin' At Me.  That sucks sour balls, but it wasn't us.  Gene, what happened?  My candy, it's gone!  - What? - You, too?  - Who took it? - That guy!  No. That guy. I-I didn't see!  Someone just yanked it out of my hand!  Told you it wasn't us.  Yeah, man, those accusations sting.  They're picking us off one by one.  - I think I'm dying. - Oh, no!  His eyes are rolling back in his head!  Get him a fun size candy bar, stat!  - Gene, stay with us, buddy. - Oh, God. Oh, God.  - Here, I got one! - Put it under his tongue!  I've got a heartbeat here.  He's stabilizing.  You gave us a real scare there, little buddy.  Don't you ever do that to me again!  Okay, happy Halloween.  Sorry we don't have good candy.  My husband's not allowed to buy the candy anymore.  We're gonna show up that handsome bastard.  - Y-You think he's handsome? - You don't?  I don't know. I didn't I mean, he's not really my type.  He's got a good body, though.  Are you kidding? He has a great body.  Yeah, but without the body,  you wouldn't say he's handsome.  I would. All right.  Here we go.  Whoa, nice.  Look at it go!  Plus, it's motion activated.  Whoa, what the hell is that?  Looks like a ghost?  I'm projecting this ghost-like image onto a superfine mist.  It's amazing, I know.  Wow, it looks really real.  Yup, it's a hell of an effect over here  at Those Who Can, Dle Candles.  Well, uh, my spider cr-crawls a little bit now, so  It really jiggles around, doesn't it?  Yeah, well, it, uh  It's, uh I give up. You win.  - Did you just give up? - Yes, Glenn.  Well, Teddy wasn't finished with his spider yet.  - I wasn't? - No, he has big plans still, Glenn.  It's, like, 8:30.  We know it's late, okay?  Glenn, ever heard of a grand finale? I didn't think so.  I've heard of a grand finale.  Well, you're about to hear of one. More.  Come on, Teddy, you-you've got to finish doing  what you were gonna do with this not done spider.  Okay, because I'm definitely gonna do that.  - So let's do it. - Let's go.  - Here we go. Okay. - Go, go, go.  - We're going. I'm going. - Go, Teddy, go.  Stick around, Glenn,  if you want to see a thing that we're doing  that we definitely know what it is.  We just got to rebuild, one trick or treat at a time.  Can we re-trick-or-treat the places  we've already trick-or-treated?  Is that even legal?  Wait. You all got your candy stolen  while you were on Ocean Avenue, right?  - Yeah. - So that means,  if we don't want our candy stolen,  we got to stay off the street.  And stay in school.  No, we're only safe in the stores.  From now on, do not touch Ocean Avenue unless you have to.  The street is lava, okay? Go, go, go  Thank you.  Okay. Two at a time.  Darryl, Rudy, I want you to hug that wall  like it's your mama at bedtime. Ready?  - Ready. - Sort of.  Now, go, go, go.  Next two.  Okay, we're all safe inside,  and Tina and I still have our candy.  - Good job, everyone. - Up from the ashes, here we go.  Time to trick-or-treat this mamma-jamma.  Trick or treat, smell my feet and whatnot, good sir?  Thank you.  Trick or Somebody took my bag!  - Somebody took my bag! - Who? Did you see who took it?  No! Yes! I don't know, I don't know!  So the street is lava and now the stores are lava, too?  Everywhere can't be lava. That's not how lava works.  Happy Halloween. Here you go.  - Thank you. - Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.  Oh, what about fries? You want some fries?  Or coffee? I just put a pot on.  Ooh, sugar. You just  do you want to just take that instead?  Just take that. There you go.  These candy thieves can hit us wherever they want.  What does it matter anymore? My candy's gone.  - Ah! - I still have my candy.  Speaking of which, can I have some?  Preferably a Sticky Sugar-Boom?  No! Yes.  Some, if you defend it.  All right, good. I feel surrounded.  Let's head towards home and get  this candy into the vault.  Wait, I forget, which one of us is dressed like a gorilla?  - Um, none, I think? - Then who's that?  - Catch him! - There's a gorilla in our midst!  Where'd that gorilla go?  - There he is! - Are we chasing him?  Are we gonna kill him? I think I can do it.  - No. Let's just follow him. - Right, right. Sorry.  Yeah, follow him.  Maybe he leads us to his dumb friends  and we get all of our stolen candy back.  Hey, stop.  Damn it. Wrong gorilla.  Sorry. Cute baby.  There. He's on that side street.  He's too fast.  And I'm not just saying that as a slow boy.  That electric skateboard thingy really moves.  That's cheating.  Yeah, gorillas can't even ride those things, probably.  Damn it. How are we gonna catch him?  Huh.  Bus driver, follow that gorilla.  You got it. Hold on tight, kids.  We're gaining on him.  Wow, he's really good on that thing.  Ugh, that was tough to watch.  I mean, you root for him to fall off and then he falls off,  and then you don't know how to feel.  Wait, what am I doing? I have a route.  I give into peer pressure way too easily.  Are you serious? This is an emergency.  A candy emergency.  You know what else is an emergency?  Respecting myself.  Go on, get out. Enjoy the night.  He's going towards the wharf. He's on foot now.  We can get him. Halloween turbo speed, go!  I don't think I have that feature.  How's it going out here, with the decorations  you're still putting up for some reason?  Wait, what's with the bandana?  Oh, I wanted to dress up.  How is that dressing up?  I'm Bruce Springsteen.  Bruce Springsteen? Not really.  I thought you were Rambo.  No. I wouldn't just put on a bandana.  I'm wearing jeans, Teddy.  I look like Bruce Springsteen.  Anyway, we're in the middle of something  - revolutionary here, Lin. - Yeah. We're about to  we're about to show up Glenn in a big way.  Yeah. He's bad news, Lin,  and he's going down.  He thought it was ""Glory Days,""  but it's about to be ""Thunder Road.""  I don't get it. Is that a line from Rambo?  Wait, what's on the spider's legs?  - Oh, those are chain saws. - Wha chain saws?  - Not real ones, though, right? - No, they're real.  Are they on all the spider's legs?  Well, not all of them.  We could only get four chain saws.  Got a couple of legs that have nail guns.  Yeah, and one's got a hammer.  I'm not explaining to the kids that their dad died  in a chain saw spider accident.  - Yeah. - And if you chop your hands off,  I'm not wiping your butt for you.  You know our arrangement.  I know our arrangement. I'll be careful.  Okay, I-I think we're ready.  I hope Glenn is still around so he sees.  This bad boy's got some real power,  so I'm just gonna start out nice and slow  - Whoa! Whoa! - Shut it off!  - Whoa! Whoa! - Oh, boy, okay!  - Shut if off - No! No!  My bat! And my mist ghost!  What the hell happened out here?  Um, I think maybe a kid threw an egg.  We got the worst of it.  Damn it. Where did he go?  Maybe this is a bad idea.  Yeah, maybe we should stop chasing this gorilla  and go back to trick-or-treating.  No. Guys, it's late.  The good stuff is gone.  We're after the mother lode now.  All the candy that's been taken from all the kids tonight.  We're going to get everything.  Which we're gonna give back  to all the kids if we find it?  - Sure, sure, yeah. Mm-hmm. - There he is!  He's going into Mutilation Mansion.  - Let's follow him! - But I don't want  to be mutilated tonight.  I worked really hard on this onesie.    Uh, I might just, uh, stay out here,  and look for the astronaut and that devil, um,  and that Jason guy.  Any suspicious hockey goalie, really.  I'm gonna give Tina some backup.  So we'll be out here being brave.  Ugh, suit yourselves. Let's go.  Oh, I didn't like that.  Okay, where is that damn gorilla?  I really want our candy back,  but I also really want to leave.  There's no turning back now, Rudy.  Well, the door's right there.  There could be some turning back now.  It's not far, is what he's saying.  - No, gah. Both of you, stop it. - There!  He's going into the ""Ballroom of Blood.""  Let's see if we can corner him in there.  As long as we don't see any blood.  I got a thing about that.  - So how's school going? - Good, good.  H-How's work?  - Same old, same old. - Mm.  We made the right call to stay out here,  - didn't we? - I'm enjoying our conversation.  It's nice to catch up.  Scarred for life! Scarred for life!  - Oh, God. - Where'd he go?  He's got to be in here.  Tina, Gene.  We realized you might need us in here  more than we needed to not be in here.  Also, a guy came out and puked, like, ten feet from us.  It did not smell great.  You guys are heroes.  How'd you even see him in here?  We tackled a lot of people before we tackled him.  But-but they're pretty cool about it.  All right, gorilla. Who are you?  Dr. Yap?  You stole our candy?  Me? What? That's crazy.  - W-Who is that? - That's our dentist.  Astronaut costume, devil costume, Jason mask.  It wasn't a bunch of teens, it was just one dentist?  But why, Yap? Why would you steal our candy?  I didn't want to. You left me no choice.  Every year I sent out my flyers with my very generous  cash for candy offer, and every year, it's ignored!  - It's never gonna happen. - Yeah. no.  - Nope. - Yeah, that's not no. Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's a terrible deal.  But stealing?  Taking candy from sweet, adorable children, really?  I had to this year, 'cause of Sticky Sugar-Booms.  Do you know how bad they are for your teeth?  Of course you don't.  Because you didn't barely graduate dental school.  I care about you kids.  That's why I hunted you down like animals all night.  Don't you make more money if kids get a lot of cavities?  Ah, that's a common misconception.  Plus, cavities are gross and they smell weird.  And I don't want to fill cavities all winter.  I want to go skiing.  Where's the rest of the candy, Yap?  I can't tell you that.  - Where is it, dentist? - Let's just say  your Halloween has been incinerated?  Ah, ha! The incinerator. Guys, follow me.  Did I say ""incinerated""? I meant ""it's in the ocean.""  Damn it.  Oh, we're so sorry about this.  It really got out of hand.  And all this because my handyman  - wanted to impress your handyman. - What?  - What? - Impress me?  Yeah. He said you're the handyman's handyman,  and he wanted to show you up.  Glenn did most of this out of his own pocket.  - Poor thing. - What are you guys talking about?  - Uh - Uh, nothing. Cologne.  Uh, just, uh, what a good job you did here.  Oh, uh, well, thanks, Teddy, I've always, uh,  I've always liked your work.  Except when you chainsawed everything.  That was Bob's idea. You know how it goes,  you get hired for a job,  and then you got to do whatever the guy says? Huh?  - Uh, what? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Right?  Toilet's not gonna fit in here, you say, right?  So you put the toilet in  and then you find out it doesn't fit.  But I already measured it, sir,  and I told you it wasn't gonna fit.  That's the kind of idiot I'm dealing with over here.  Okay, T uh, Teddy, take it easy.  Incinerator guy, stop!  - Stop incinerating! - Decinerate!  - Wait, what, huh? - Don't burn that candy!  But I was told to burn the candy.  Well, you've also been told to not burn the candy.  By us, just now.  So makes you think?  It's just, my word is all I have, and I said  I would burn the candy, so I'm gonna burn the candy.  Yes, burn the candy.  No! You evil jackass.  You really feel good about burning kids' candy  - on Halloween? - Yes, he does.  Oh, wait, it's Halloween?  It is. The one holiday, mind you,  where there's no hugging, there's no singing,  there aren't even cards.  We dress as monsters and we threaten people with tricks  and they give us candy and it's beautiful.  Hey, you had me at ""it is.""  I-I didn't know it was Halloween already.  That's what being in a coma  for six months will do to you.  Oh, okay.  So can we have the candy?  Yeah.  But what about your teeth? They're gonna rot.  Some of us have disposable teeth.  Yeah, nothing's forever, Yap.  I mean, except for my teeth. They're adult teeth.  But I floss.  No. No, you don't.  - Sometimes. - Barely.  Hey, you look like you might've lost something.  Oh, sorry. You okay?  Here you go, kid. Stick this in your face-hole.  - Here. - Yay, candy.  Okay, okay. Easy, easy.  Candy for you, candy for you,  and here's some candy for you.  So you didn't make it to Mutilation Mansion, huh?  No, Zeke got scared, and then I then got scared  to make him feel better. Maybe next year.  I guess we're stuck between tricks and treats.  We're Hallo-tweeners.  I hear that. I mean, I went in Mutilation Mansion  with, like, fourth graders, but cool.  Hey, ask me what's in my briefcase.  Wha-What's in your briefcase?  Nun of your business.

"1    FROND: Belchers, I've been going over the detention records,  and you kids owe five hours of detention.  So, we suffer from detention deficit disorder.  Yeah, shouldn't that get us out of detention?  No! You're detention dodgers.  Medical excuses,  religious holidays,  conscientious objections.  It's time to pay up.  But five hours? That's like five days.  Well, you can do the hard time, or  you can help me with a special project I'm working on.  Instead of serving out  your detention sentence,  you can appear in my music video.  Ugh, pass.  No, no, no. No, wait, wait, wait, hang on.  I need you kids to help me get this video done. Like, today.  Maybe throw in a hundred dollars?  Deal! N-No, wait, what am I saying?  Listen, there's a week-long guidance counselor conference  this week here in town. Counsel-Con.  Yeah, that Counsel-Con.  - That sounds fun. - A lot of cat sitters  getting work this week.  It is fun.  Except I'm in charge of, like,  six things on the welcome committee.  And, trust me, none of these prima Donnas  even open their welcome envelope.  They put the ""diva"" in ""child de-velopment.""  They probably won't even appreciate  that I got the ocean view conference room  at the Spinnaker Hotel.  And thank you for reminding me  I can't find a friggin' cat sitter.  So it's up to you. Do the rhyme or do the time.  My video has rhymes in it.  Ugh, fine.  Oh, look at Busta Rhymes over here.  LINDA: What you doing, Teddy? You making a little hat?  No, I-I'm making a paper airplane. All done.  (grunts, groans)  That's not gonna win me a washing machine.  - Washing machine? - Yeah, there's gonna be  a paper airplane contest at the air show on Saturday.  The washing machine's the grand prize.  So, wait, you throw paper airplanes at an air show?  Isn't that like bringing a stuffed animal to the zoo?  I did that once.  I wanted to see what their reaction was.  - They liked it. - Yeah, halfway through the show,  there's a paper airplane contest.  They put a washing machine on the runway with the door open,  and everyone tosses their paper airplanes from the bleachers.  And then there's other appliances out there, too.  You put your name on the plane, and if you get it  in the toaster, you win the toaster.  And if you get it in the Crock-Pot,  you win the Crock-Pot!  It sounds easy!  Definitely doesn't sound easy.  But we could use a new washing machine.  Oh. Yeah. Ours smells like something died in there.  Well, it's because that mouse died in there.  Yeah, he died 'cause it smelled so bad.  Okay, Bob's the best folder, I'm the best thrower.  - You're not the best thrower. - What?  All your throws hook to the left, Bob.  You're a hooker, like my cousin Marie.  Your cousin Marie's a prostitute?  No, she throws paper airplanes like you.  - It's your mechanics. - So, it's settled.  I'm the best at throwing, you're the best at folding.  Eh. And I'm the guy who kind of regrets  telling you guys about this. Just kidding.  This will be fun. (chuckles weakly)  Let's swap eyes so we can   Empathize   (flatly):  Let's swap eyes over a bowl of   -  Em-pad-Thai.  - Okay, cut, cut, cut.  (sighs)  Louise. I'm not really feeling you feeling it.  - You feel me? - Oh, you're not? You're not?  - No. - Oh, wow.  Can we get a copy of this?  Mom would love this video.  Mom doesn't get to see this.  No one we know will see this.  - That was the deal, Mr. Frond. - Don't worry.  ""The Empathize Glide"" is only gonna be viewed  at the Counsel-Con welcome banquet.  Unless it impresses Judith, because she sets the curriculum  - for the whole state. - Excuse me?  Doesn't matter. It's just a proof of concept.  I'd get actually talented kids to be in the real thing.  Thank you. Wait, what?  You absolutely, positively promise  that no one at school will see this video?  You have my word as an educator/rapper/healer.  (giggling)  (humming ""The Empathize Glide"")  Empathize.   Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  This can't be happening!  It's happening.  It's really brave of you to be here  at school and not hiding in the woods forever.  Tina, you look really weird in that video.  Right, but like a sassy, fun, ""you want to walk to school  - with me every day"" weird? - No, weird like I feel  like I should help you or give money to a charity  that helps people like you.  Mr. Frond.  (grunting)  Ah! Okay, I-I see that you are  processing recent developments.  Perhaps, uh, Process-ily Cecily could help.  Process-ily Cecily can process her ass!  - (gasps) - You promised that no one  at school would see us singing and dancing in your dumb video!  Hold his arms! We're gonna make it look like an accident!  Easy, girl!  It's not my fault.  I was editing the video on the library computer  when nature called. I got up without logging out,  and when I came back, the kids were watching the video.  Ah! You always log out before outing a log!  - (roars) - Okay.  That's healthy. You vented.  And, yes, I promised.  But there's nothing we can do now.  This isn't over, Frond.  There's only one way to deal with this bull-crap.  - We got to - Kill something he loves?  - Oh, my! - Maybe not kill.  - But definitely revenge. - BRANCA: Aw!  I'd just gotten it out of my head,  and then I see you kids again.  (humming ""The Empathize Glide"")  Em-pad-Thais.   A million hours of detention would have been better  than winding up as Frond's puppets.  He humiliated us. We need to do the same to him.  (gasps) Counsel-Con.  Yes! We become the world's youngest guidance counselors  and show him up while helping a lot of people along the way.  No, he called the other counselors ""divas,"" remember?  What if we get Frond trash-talking them on video  and then post it somewhere for the whole conference to see?  But how do we get them all to watch it?  He's got to be there and suffer like we suffered.  Right.  LOUISE: Guys, we just found our solution.  GENE: We get divorced?  - No. - Oh, phew.  Ooh (chuckles) Whoa.  Okay, after we get video of Mr. Frond  talking trash about his friends,  we'll put the link on an airplane banner that says  ""hottest cats for guidance counselors.""  And when it flies by the Spinnaker Hotel  GENE: Every single one of them will pull it up on their phones,  and Mr. Frond will be completely humiliated.  TINA: Crushed.  Humiliated, crushed, and destroyed.  Like every buffet after I'm done with it.  (Linda breathing heavily)  Lin, you want to weigh in on which airplane design  to go with?  This one, you have to do over 60 precision folds.  And Barry recommends finishing it off  with a four-degree dihedral angle.  Barry? Who's Barry?  Barry B. Foldin'. He wrote this book.  He's a genius.  Wait, you bought a book about paper airplanes?  Not a book, Lin, the book.  Barry is a legend in the paper aviation community.  Wait, what's that thing?  - It's my folding tool. - You can't just use your finger?  Uh, no.  Not when you're building a competition-grade aircraft, Lin.  This is probably the best ten dollars  I've ever spent.  That thing cost ten dollars? How much did the book cost?  I-I don't want to talk about it.  (Linda grunting)  You might not want to overdo it with the arm strengthening, Lin.  You worry about your folds,  mama's gonna bring home the gold.  Washing machine gold. Whoo!  Oh, I am using the wrong paper.  Oh, my God. I-I gotta go.  - I'll be right back. - (Lin grunting)  Hi, uh, I-I need to buy some paper.  This is an art store. Be specific, for God's sakes!  Yeah. Do you go in a liquor store and say, ""I need liquor""?  Yeah, I bet he does.  Okay, I-I need 24-pound A4 paper. Do you know what that is?  - Ah, making paper airplanes? - Yeah, is that the right paper?  For an amateur, sure.  W-Wait, what's for more of a professional?  No, you can't handle it. You can't afford it.  Can I see it?  - No! - Please?  - Fine. - Harold, lock the door.  Put on the gloves. Show him.    Good God, it's beautiful.  Stop breathing on it.  W-W-Wait-wait-wait. How much?  How much are you willing to spend?  (whispering): Everything.  - How much do you want? - All of it.  Harold, we're closing early.  Tonight we drink wine out of a bottle.  Hey, Mr. Frond, sorry about yesterday.  We were cuckoo bonkers.  I think Counsel-Con is just making all of us crazy, right?  Ah, don't get me started.  Do you mind if I put my groceries on your desk?  - Ignore the hole. - Sure, go ahead.  I'm sorry, you were saying something  about Counsel-Con going smooth, loving the people  Oh, the people. Gary, carrying his own  gluten-free snacks everywhere, making comments.  And June Wilson with the perfume.  What happened, did you fall in the bottle?  But everyone's super cool, right?  No. Why does guidance counseling attract the most uncool people?  If I had to rank them from stiff to stiffest,  dead last would be Gilbert McDougal.  And not because of his neck brace,  I'm talking personality only.  And then probably Manoj  We got him. We got him so good.  - Did we run out of tape? - Yeah.  He just ignored the rewinding sound  - and kept talking. - Phase one complete.  Phase two: we upload this sucker,  and then phase three.  Okay, so after we make our own banner,  we come back here, switch 'em out,  and then that plane flies our revenge banner  in front of the Spinnaker Hotel, and  Hey, you aren't supposed to be on the airstrip.  LOUISE: Sure we are. We're the new flight crew.  GENE: Hot towel? Hot towel?  Wait, you kids look familiar.  Oh, yeah. You, too.  You once tried to make out with our mom,  but she kicked your butt.  I'm gonna need more than that.  (chuckling): I'm kidding. I remember you guys.  How's your mom? She still with your dad?  Yep, and she and I have our thing, too,  so back off, fly-boy!  Wait, why are you here? Aren't you a seaplane pilot?  I took the pontoons off Shoshana  so I can fly banner ads,  since my sexy flight lesson business kinda dried up.  So, why are you kids sneaking onto the airfield?  Drug smuggling? Muling? You kids muling?  No, we're trying to get revenge.  Revenge, eh?  Yeah, we want to humiliate this guy  who basically destroyed our lives.  Interesting. Life is a funny mistress sometimes.  Get this. My nemesis is coming to town for the air show,  and I was literally just brainstorming on my revenge.  But bumping into you sneaky weasels gives me an idea.  You want to raise weasels?  No, a proposition. I'll fly a revenge banner for you  - if you help me get my revenge. - KIDS: Deal.  Oh, look at you agreeing before you know  - any of the weird details. - That's the Belcher way.  Hey, Gus, look who I found on the airfield.  They're gonna help me with my revenge plan.  That's nice.  So, Kurt, who's the target? Is it (whistles)  Hey, what?!  No, it's a stunt pilot.  All you need to know is she's pure evil.  Her name is Laverne.  Kurt and Laverne used to be part  of a stunt flying team, until she stole  the Dice N' Slice from Kurt  and made him look ridiculous!  - Okay, easy, Gus. - Sorry, I got excited.  What's a Dice N' Slice?  It's the best aerial acrobatic stunt ever.  I'd worked on it for months with my coach,  and was about to unveil it to the world,  but she stole it from me.  And that's all I'm gonna say about that.  Yeah, that's all he's gonna say about that.  Okay, fine, I'll tell you everything.  Whoa, I was wrong.  (exhales) It was 20 years ago,  at the nationals.  GENE: Go on.  KURT: I watched Laverne's plane dice roll,  and then I watched it slice.  I was determined to out-dice and out-slice her,  so I pushed that plane and my body to the limits.  I was upside down, pulling so many Gs.  And also I'd had a massive breakfast  at the airfield cafÃ©.  It was free for us stunt pilots.  I mean, who wouldn't have had two orders of huevos rancheros?  The g-force made it all come plopping down.  What do you mean ""It all came plopping down""?  - He pooped the pit. - Gus!  You did.  Ah. It's true, just as I was passing the judges' table.  So, bonus points for style?  I wish. Three things I haven't done since that day  Talked to Laverne, go upside down under any circumstances,  eat huevos rancheros.  Those are the best kind of huevos!  How are we gonna get her back?  Here's the plan.  Laverne always take pictures with fans before a show.  I want you kids to pose as fans, then use these  - What are those? - Wire cutters.  I want you to go under her plane  and snip the red ignition wire, the blue fuel line,  and whatever the black wire is.  Uh, we're not cutting anyone's wires.  Well, I can't do it!  Ever since she caught me trying to put a banana  in her plane pipe, she hired security guards.  That's why I need you kids to do it for me.  What gives?! I thought we were revenge twins.  We are, we are, but maybe there's another way  for you to get revenge on Laverne  without her having to emergency-land her plane,  - possibly dying. - Can't think of one.  Why don't you just beat her  in the stunt flying competition at the air show?  Wouldn't that be the sweetest revenge?  Yeah, do the Dice N' Slice,  and ideally without pooping the pit.  Didn't you hear me?!  I don't go upside down anymore.  (voice breaking): I can't fly upside down.  (crying): I can't do it.  - (sobbing) - Oh, wow. Okay.  - Hey, bu-buddy - (whining)  Uh, you just need a little help getting upside down again.  We can do that. Huh? We're kids.  We're good at going upside down.  Yeah, I'm not super comfortable going upside down.  - (mutters) Tina, just be quiet. - Okay.  New deal we help you get your upside-down mojo back  and beat Laverne, you fly our revenge banner  so we can destroy Frond.  Uh fine.  Dice, slice   Fold   Nice   Toss in there   Upside-down hair.   Hello, Bob.  - Barry B. Foldin'? - Yes, I be.  I see you have Bowfinger in your hand.  Y-Yeah. I'm-I'm trying to choose  between Bowfinger and Dirty Rotten Scoundrel  - for the big contest. - Both great options.  So, Bob, what's the hold-up?  I can't decide which plane is the best.  The answer is in your hand.  - Whoa! - It's called  ""What About Bob?""  It's the best fold from my best planes combined.  Go ahead. Fling it.  BOB: Whoa!  It's flying so far!  Aah! I got to fold! I got to fold!  - (panting) - Oh, wha wha ?  MALE ANNOUNCER (over P.A.): Look up.  It's a bird, it's a plane.  Just kidding. It's a plane!  Look who decided to waltz on in  The Wind Waltzers, that's who.  Let's hear it for 'em, folks.  (Tchaikovsky's ""Waltz of the Flowers"" playing)  Where'd the kids go?  They said they were gonna go find healthy snacks. Might take a while.  Can I sit next to you until they come back?  Uh, that's where the plane's sitting,  -but you can sit next to the plane. - Uh, okay.  There she is.  There you go, sweetheart.  She seems nice.  Hello, Laverne.  Well, well, well.  If it isn't Kurt. What? No banana?  He doesn't need bananas anymore.  - He's got us. - Who are you?  I've been training with them for the past 48 hours straight,  not counting a date I had, which went medium.  Doesn't matter how much you train, fella. I'm the best.  It's like Dad always said Training's for trains, these are planes.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up. Dad?!  Yeah, Dad was our coach.  Laverne is your sister?  Laverne hasn't been my sister since she stole my move.  I don't have any sisters! But, yeah, she's my sister.  Stole your move?  You tried to steal the Dice N' Slice from me.  Pssh! What?! Nuh-uh, liar!  Well, it's my move!  My move, and I'm taking it back.  ANNOUNCER: First up in the trick flying competition  Kurt Enerny!  Well, good luck up there.  Try not to poop the pit. (laughs weakly)  Oh, my God, she's gonna crush me!  I can't do this!  And why did I have huevos rancheros for breakfast today?  - Ow! - You listen to me.  You're gonna get up in the sky  and win this trick flying competition,  then tow our banner in front of the Spinnaker Hotel.  Today is the day for revenge!  Now squeeze your cheeks and soar like an eagle!  ANNOUNCER: He's pulling three Gs up there.  Hey, what's it feel like, Kurt?  Like my kidneys are playing patty-cake  with my intestines.  ANNOUNCER: And here comes the Dice N' Slice,  made famous by another stunt pilot.  Who stole it from me!  - Here we go. - Come on, Kurt.  ANNOUNCER: Here's the intentional stall-out,  followed by the dice roll.  (gibbering)  - (engine sputters) - And here comes the slice!  He's doing it. He's upside down,  and he's not pooping.  - Probably. - Come on, finish your revenge,  so we can have ours!  (groaning)  I did it! I'm back!  The Dice N' Slice belongs to me. (whooping)  Uh, Kurt, you missed the ribbon, pal,  by 50, maybe 60 feet.  Oh, no! Did the judges see?  Yes, the judges saw.  They have pretty good seats.  Ah, Kurt!  Serves him right for trying to steal my move.  I trained for months with Dad perfecting the Dice N' Slice.  Wait. What? Kurt said their dad taught him that move.  ANNOUNCER: Now who's ready to see the Dice N' Slice  by the best?  Put your hands together for Laverne Enerny.  New plan. Go back to my old plan.  Well, at least you kids talked Kurt out  of doing something stupid and dangerous.  I guess, and we'll still get our revenge on Mr. Frond, so  GENE: Uh, what's Kurt doing?  GUS: Something stupid and dangerous!  ANNOUNCER: Well, folks, uh, it looks like the solo competition  has turned into a completely planned, uh,  World War I dogfight reenactment.  Who's that behind you, Laverne? It's me.  Aw. Try that again, moron, and I'll do this.  I hate your guts so much, turd face!  Uh, World War I pilots would often say that to each other.  Completely authentic dogfight.  Ugh! She didn't even steal the Dice N' Slice from him,  and he didn't steal it from her.  Wait. What are you talking about, Tina?  Their dad trained them both to do that move,  and neither of them know it. We have to tell them.  Kind of hard to tell them that now.  They're way up there, and we're way down here.  Stupid gravity!  You could talk to them on the radio.  Use the one in this plane.  Kurt, can you hear me?  Yes, but I'm a little busy right now trying to knock  my sister out of the sky. Can't wait to see  the look on your face, Laverne, when you emergency-land  - like a dork. - LAVERNE: Not if you  emergency-land first, you double dork.  Stop fighting! You're both double dorks.  Why are the kids part of the air show?  - Is this for school? - Maybe.  I mean, we never help them with school stuff,  so we really wouldn't know.  Guys, knock it off. No one stole the Dice N' Slice.  What do you mean, ""No one stole the Dice N' Slice""?  TINA: You both trained with your dad to create that move.  Then he must have lied to both of you  when he said the other person stole it.  But why would he pit us against each other?  Maybe he thought if we competed, it would bring out our best,  like how he used to put that one present under the tree  and make us wrestle for it.  This is crazy.  They just need to do that thing in Mr. Frond's dumb video.  Yeah. You guys need to try and look at it  from each other's perspective.  It's time to empathize, people.  KURT: So it really wasn't your fault, Laverne?  LAVERNE: No, and I guess it wasn't your fault, either.  - (crying): I'm sorry. - (crying): I'm sorry, too.  (both crying)  (announcer yells)  Oh, whoa.  And, uh, this ends, like all good dogfights do,  with-with a good hard cry.  So the Empathize Glide actually works.  Maybe Mr. Frond is a genius?  No, no, but he probably doesn't deserve  to get destroyed by us.  Kurt, we don't want you to fly our revenge banner anymore.  What? Oh, do ? Oh, okay.  Only problem is, it's already en route.  See, I couldn't fly this plane and tow the banner,  so I called in a favor.  Well, can't you just radio him to turn around?  He doesn't have his radio on when he flies.  He doesn't want the flight tower yelling at him.  Why would the tower yell at him?  'Cause he doesn't have his pilot's license.  Oh, I'm flying.  Kurt, that banner cannot fly in front of that hotel, understand?  KURT: What am I supposed to do?  (gasps) The Dice N' Slice.  Well, how's that gonna help?  Focus on the slicing part.  Oh. Yeah.  Let's swap eyes so we can   Empathize.   ""Hottest cats for guidance counselors.""  Oh, just a gorgeous day.  Lot of puffy clouds out here.  Aah!  Holy crap! What the hell is going on?! Aah!  I thought we was friends.  Huh.  Your little problem has been sliced.  - All right! - Yay! - (whoops)  And we're at the halfway mark of this totally normal air show.  So, paper airplane contestants, you are clear for takeoff.  BOB: Okay, here we go.  Good luck, Lin.  - Oh ow! - Are you okay?  I don't know. Something popped.  Something popped? I-In your throwing arm?  - Ow, ow, ow. - Oh, my God.  You overdid it with the olive oil can, didn't you?  - Maybe. - (sighs)  Ugh, I guess we weren't meant to win the washing machine.  - Bob, you shut your pretty mouth. - Uh  Listen to me: you're gonna throw the airplane.  (muffled): No, no, no, no, no.  I'm the builder, you're the thrower.  Geez, you guys are kind of falling apart.  Odds of Team Teddy are just getting better by the  Ah, crap.  Sorry, ma'am. Is your baby okay?  Come on, Bobby. You might be a hooker,  but you're a hooker with a heart of gold.  So what if you just push  one of your wing-flappy thingies down on one side?  Yeah, that might work.  All right. (exhales)  Here goes. (grunts)  Ooh. It's beautiful.  BOB: We might actually win.  LINDA: And it just flew past the washing machine.  - Damn it. - And into the blender!  We won a blender! Yes!  - Ha, ha! - All right!  Kids, we won a blender!  - We're rich. - Nice. There's so many things  I've been wanting to blend.  We've just been smushing stuff with our hands.  Smoothies at Bob's place, everybody. Come on!  Let's swap eyes   So we can empathize   Let's swap eyes   Over a bowl of em-pad-Thai   I want some noodles   Let's swap eyes   Ooh   So we can empathize   Let's swap eyes   -  Ooh  -  Over a bowl of em-pad-Thai."
"1    LOUISE: So let me get this straight.  This is called a ""toy aisle,"" and some kids have parents  who come here and buy things for them? (laughs)  That sounds made-up.  How are we all having the same dream right now?  Kids, pick out a gift, please.  We're already late for your friend's party.  He's not our friend. We barely talk to Colton.  He's not even in any of our grades.  There's a lot of nice people who aren't in our grades.  Name one, and don't say Mom.  You know what I think this is?  Colton's padding out his invite list to get more presents.  He's a gift grubber.  Louise, come on, give Colton a chance.  Tina's right, you got to give people a chance.  Sometimes they surprise you.  Now, seriously, pick a gift and let's go.  Fine. Rubik's Cube. Well, a fake one.  It says ""Multicolored Puzzle Square.""  - Ugh, I want it. - Toys are great.  EDITH: There are no price tags  on the batteries. How much are the batteries?  - How much are the batteries?! - I don't work here.  Then what's with the attitude?!  Ugh, it's Edith.  - Kids, let's go. - What's wrong, Dad?  (imitating Bob): Give her a chance. She might surprise you.  That only applies if it's not Edith.  She's always awful.  Dad, maybe someday when you're old,  a family will run away from you.  Wow. They went all out.  It says on the invite the theme is The Great Gatsby.  I don't know about great.  Kind of a weird theme for a kid's party.  Hi. We're Colton's parents. I'm Blake and this is Allison.  Well, aren't you kids the bee's knees.  Colton, come say hi!  Here you go, a boater for the little gentleman  and flapper feathers for the girls.  - Ha. That's cute. - Want to swap?  Yes, please! Call me Feather Locklear.  - Colton? What do we say? - Thanks for coming to my party.  Thank you for having us, Colton. We brought you a present.  Add it to the present pile, Colton.  Can't I just open my presents now?  Party first, bud, then presents.  (groans)  - See? Classic gift grubber. - Oh, wait, before you go,  Colton, let me get a pic with your friends.  After you take your finger out of your nose.  (chuckles) Finger out of your No, you just switched fingers.  Better, that's better.  Okay! Say, ""23 skidoo!""  ALL: 23 skidoo.  Okay, well, I got to get back to the restaurant,  so, uh, have fun.  - 23 skidoo to you! - I don't know what that means.  - Neither do we! - Okay. Bye.  Hey, Teddy, you got a spring in your step today.  Oh, no, wait, you look depressed.  Eh, well, the good news is I've got a second date  with that lady I told you about, Caroline.  - That's great! - Yeah, but she wants to get sushi.  I hate sushi, but Caroline loves sushi,  so I said, ""Hey, I love sushi, too!""  And now I got to sit across from her  and choke on my disgusting lies.  Why don't you just get the chicken teriyaki?  Why don't you just get the chicken teriyaki, Mort?!  Whoa, whoa, Teddy, calm down. We can help you.  We can get you to like sushi.  Really? But my date's tonight. It's not enough time.  We'll see about that. I'll call in a sushi order.  - Oh, my God, this is happening. - Can I get a spicy tuna roll?  Can I get a California inside-out roll, please?  Hold on, hold on, let me get a pencil.  Should we just be a sushi restaurant?  Don't tell Bob; we'll see if he notices.  - (Edith panting) - Hmm, is that Edith?  She's really struggling with those bags. Kinda sorry.  Oh! Pee and poop!  (sigh) Oh god, alright.  Edith, hey do you need a ride?  Oh Bob, I saw you in the store and tried to avoid you  - Okay, so you're alright then? - Hm, I'll take a ride  - Yes, that would be very helpful - Oh, great then hop in.  Your car looks like it has ants.  - It does. - I feel bad for them.  So, you were walking really far, huh?  I can't drive my car right now.  Oh, I-is there something wrong with it?  No, I have fits, bad ones.  Oh, what does ""fits"" mean exactly?  - Fits! Fits! - Or we could just not talk.  - Here. - What are these?  Pills. Hold on to the bottle.  If I start to have a fit, just put one in my hand.  Great. I'm so glad we're doing this.  - Bob, would you do me a favor? - Another one?  I just need to make a quick stop.  I wouldn't trouble you, but it's so hard being older  and not being able to drive.  BOB: (sighs) Okay, I guess a quick stop would be fine, Edith.  All right, guys and dolls, we're gonna learn the Charleston.  First you wiggle that finger. Then you jiggle those knees.  A-wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. A-jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.  - Oh, my God, this is so cute. - I love it. I'm dying.  Ugh, look at Colton.  He's just picking his nose till present time.  That'd be a great name for his autobiography.  Louise, give Colton a chance.  DANCE INSTRUCTOR: Tall flapper in the glasses?  Remember to wiggle your finger.  - Sorry. - Pssh.  Colton doesn't deserve all those presents,  and he certainly doesn't deserve  our perfectly fine off-brand puzzle toy.  We should take it back.  What? No! I think that's against birthday party etiquette.  Well, I follow David Arquette-iquette,  and that guy does whatever he wants.  Plus, I really don't think you're right about him, Louise.  Oh, yeah? Prove me wrong.  DANCE INSTRUCTOR: Tall flapper in the glasses!  I'm wiggling, damn it!  Ugh, finally. Whoa.  She's walking really fast. Like, really fast.  Drive, damn it, drive!  - What? - Let's move! Go!  - Wait, what's happening? - I said step on the gas, you ass!  I'm stepping on it. It's an old car.  (laughing) Eleanor Hirschbaum never knew what hit her.  Who is Eleanor Hirschbaum? What is this all about?  - Quilting. - Huh?  Quilting! What else would it be about?  My quilting circle was making a quilt  to celebrate the town history; each member got to do a square,  but my square got rejected by the bossy biddy  who leads the group, Lillian.  She said the subject matter was inappropriate.  When I stood up to her, she kicked me out of the group.  Wait, wait, wait, Lillian is the lady you just stole from?  - No, that's Eleanor! - So many old lady names.  Today, everyone's supposed to stitch their squares together  in a ceremony at the Wharf Arts Center.  Oh, it's a big fancy to-do,  but who's gonna have all the squares? Me! (laughs)  Ugh. Why did you drag me into this, Edith?  Oh, I didn't plan to. I was gonna hoof it,  but then the universe sent me a guy with a filthy car  - and nothing to lose. - Nothing to lose?  I-I have a family and a business.  The restaurant? You can't be serious.  Less talk more pedal, huh? We have squares to snatch.  - I-I'm taking you home. - Grow a pair and then some hair.  I'm not doing this, Edith. Just get out.  Ah, fine, you big baby.  Let an old lady gather her supplies and I'll be (gasps)  - Edith? - (choking)  Are you okay? Are you having a fit?  Pill! Pill, damn it, pill! Pill!  Here! Here! Aren't you gonna swallow it?  - Drive me, Bob. - What? N-No.  This is the easy part. Then comes the shaking.  - Then the spitting. - Are you crazy?!  Take the pill, Edith!  You want an old lady's fit on your conscience, Bob?  Can you live with it? (retching) Can you?  Fine! Fine, I'll drive you. Just take the pill.  (sighs) Now let's ride.  I'm taking off my seatbelt. It's chafing my honkers.  Edith, are-are you okay? I-I really think I should  just take you to the hospital and not do your plan.  Your plan is very bad.  Do you always talk this much? Pull up here.  - Wait, where are we? - Phillip Frond's house.  This is Mr. Frond's house?  You're gonna steal from my kids' guidance counselor  while I wait in the car?  Relax, I'm not gonna hurt him. Quilt people are pushovers.  You just compliment their needlework,  and they roll over like a puppy.  And when their guard's down, snatchy, snatchy.  Keep your engine running.  Ooh, it's almost badminton time, and then it'll be present time.  Oh, won't that be a treat? For Colton.  Ugh! Gene, your feet smell really bad.  I'm airing them out. All that dancing gave me soggy flapper feet.  Wait, I have an idea. We don't just take our present back,  we take our present back and plop Gene's smelly socks  in the gift bag instead.  Colton's stinking up our Saturday,  let's stink up his precious gift table.  Louise, you said you'd give me time.  Just let me talk to Colton.  He's not as bad as you think; I know it.  Ugh! Fine, Tina.  You've got until he opens presents,  then the gloves come off, the feet gloves.  Okay. Here I go.  - Hi, Colton. - Hey.  Birthdays, huh? Hey, could I ask you something?  Badminton!  Come on, flappers and dappers, let's play!  Glasses, talking to you. Colton, get your game face on.  Ah, dang it.  I feel so badly about what happened with the quilters.  There are some lovely crafts in this room.  You didn't make all this stuff yourself, did you?  Oh, actually, I did.  Oh, what are you, some kind of secret genius?  (chuckling): Secret genius?  No, no, I'm just a dabbler in the fiber arts.  Oh, my, what is that?  Ah. I call that ""Needle-Point Break.""  That's Ke-yarn-u Reeves and Patrick Swayz-yarn.  It's, uh, one in a series, actually.  Well, in that case, I must see all of them.  Oh, really? I-I've got to get them. They're in the back.  - Okay. - Have you seen Con Air?  Because there are some spoilers in the needlepoint.  Okay, well, I'll try not to look at those parts.  - Here's eight sushis. - TEDDY: What's all the stuff?  - It comes with stuff. - It comes with stuff?  Yeah, lots of little stuff. You dip it and you dunk it.  It's like a fun little game.  Uh I got to put ketchup on it.  - (phone ringing) - No, Teddy, no. Bob's Burgers.  - We're eating sushi. - What? Linda, it's me.  - Listen, I might need your help. - Bob, where the heck are you?  You were supposed to be back a half an hour ago.  Well, Edith is making me drive her all over town  -to get back at her quilters circle - TEDDY: Ugh, it hurts!  - Why?! Why?! (groans) - Is that Teddy? Is he okay?  Oh, no. Bob, I got to go.  Teddy just ate a handful of wasabi.  I thought it was guacamole. (grunts)  Hold on, here's the guacamole.  (screams) It's that stuff again!  I got to go, Bob, I got to go. Have fun with Edith. Good-bye.  - (Teddy spits) - Oh, my face!  - Drive! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! - Okay, okay.  Edith? Huh?  Darn it, I dropped Needlejuice.  Ugh, look at this crummy thing. And they rejected my square?  - My freaks? - Your freaks?  - Left here. Left. Left. Left! - (rock music playing)  What kind of getaway driver are you?  - Just do a U-ey over this lawn. - No, I  - Just drive. Come on! - Oh, God!  Come on, we got to do some quiltin'!   (engine stops)  - (engine starts) -  That's right, drive, baby   All right, smack it   Get that square, baby   Uh!   Ooh!   Come on, Bob.   That sign back there said ""yield.""  - You didn't really yield. - Yeah, it kind of felt amazing.  - You're an animal. (laughs) - (laughs) I am.  Well, we saved the worst for last  The head of the quilters circle, the horse's ass  who rejected my square, Lillian.  Great, you-you deal with that.  I'll do the sitting and waiting and driving cool.  Yeah, you forgot sweating. Nice pit stains, cool guy.  Yeah, it's a problem.  All right, next croquet group, you're up.  Can I get a picture? Colton, finger.  (sighs) Got to feel for Colton's parents.  They're working hard out there, and Colton's giving 'em nothing.  I'm gonna hit my ball towards Colton so I can try  to talk to him again. (grunts)  Oh, that didn't go very far. Let me hit again.  (grunts) That didn't go very far. Let me hit it again.  (grunts) Now I'm getting it, now I'm getting it.  Oh, my God, he's still so far away.  It's not worth slowly tapping your way over to him, Tina.  You know, sometimes,  people are as terrible as you think they are.  If you can't handle reality, you should've stayed inside of Mom.  - That was an option?! - BLAKE: Hey, I know we're in the past,  but let's move into the presents.  As in, let's open some presents!  Everyone looks confused. It's fine, it's fine.  Time's up, Tina. Gene, start the sock removal process.  - No. - Whew! I made that.  - (gags) - I'll take those.  Oh, my God, we're gonna kill him.  Wait, wait. Pre-present portraits.  Give me the anticipation. Give me the jealousy.  - Smell you later. - What are you doing?  - Colton! Hi. I was just, uh - (sniffs)  What's that smell? Were you gonna take back my gift  - and wrap dirty socks instead? - Whoa, slow down.  What you're describing is a felony, probably.  - No, I think it's hilarious. - What? You do?  Yeah. It would drive my parents nuts.  This was all their idea. They wanted everything to be perfect.  All I wanted was a pizza party for me  and my imaginary friend, Pete Zaparti.  - Pete Zaparti. Ha, ha, nice. - Thanks, I'll tell him.  Anyway, Dad said that wouldn't look good on ""sosh-meed.""  - ""Sosh-meed""? - He and my mom are always telling me  to ""act more postable.""  Well, for someone who didn't want a big party,  you seemed pretty excited to open those presents.  Yeah, because after that, everyone goes home.  I want to get to that part.  Boaters, boaters. Everybody, straighten them out.  It's fun to have straight boaters!  I'll get the bird's eye, babe. Hashtag Colton's Gatsby Day.  Ugh. Hashtag barf.  Uh, sir? The lady you drove here with is having a fit,  and technically she's not our responsibility, so  Oh, my God.  - (choking) There you are. Pill! - Here. Take it.  - (grunts) Dresser drawer. - What?  Her room's behind you. The square's in her dresser.  - I am not getting it, Edith. - (choking)  - Then I'm not taking the pill. - Ugh, fine.  U-Uh, watch her.  - I'll-I'll be right back. - (chokes)  I hate this, I hate this, I hate this, I hate this, I hate this.  Sergeant Bosco? Is Lillian Sergeant Bosco's ?  Find what you were looking for?  I'm better now. We'll be going.  - He's my lover, by the way. - Hi.  You'll stay right where you are.  The other quilters warned me you'd be coming.  My son is a police officer. He'll be here any minute.  He'll plant drugs on you. He'll plant drugs on all of you!  - Let's go, hot stuff. - Oh!  - Oh! Stop them! - Huh?  (tires screech)  - (siren wailing) - BOB: Oh, my God, oh, my God,  oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.  (whoops) Now this is how you quilt!  Oh, that was maybe the worst thing I've ever done.  Really? This is a pretty good day for me.  Now point this ""not rod"" thataway  - and drive me to my store. - (groans)  BOSCO: You called me to find your missing quilt square?  Mother, this is ridiculous.  Your brother would care about my quilt.  You only visit when they have a hot fudge sundae bar.  That is not true. Listen, I'll look into it.  - Is today hot fudge sundaes? - No.  - Damn. - And I'm going with you.  All right, fine. Are there cookies?  - You may have one cookie. - Yes.  Oh, wow, look at that. Hold it up.  Higher. Turn your head. You're loving this,  - you're loving this. - Ah  It was right in front of us all along.  Can't believe we got it so wrong.  - Well, actually, I - Shush, shush, shush.  - We all got it wrong. - Right.  There's got to be something we can do for this kid.  Well, if he thought my dirty socks were funny,  let's give him my underpants.  Ooh, or my sports bra.  Here we are.  - Good-bye, Edith. - Good-bye, Bob.  Is what I'll say after you drive us to the Wharf Arts Center.  Ceremony starts in 20 minutes.  - Step on it, chubs. - Are you kidding me?!  No time to discuss. If the cops are on our trail,  -this is the first place they'll look. -(groans)  EDITH: How's it going back there, Harold?  It's going. Ugh, take it easy on the bumps, chump.  - He's a bad driver. - Yeah, terrible.  - Learn to drive. - What are you even doing?  I thought the plan was just to take everyone's squares?  - This is phase two. - Phase two.  They're expecting a quilt at the Wharf Arts Center,  and Harold and I are gonna give it to them.  - (sighs) Unbelievable. - Oh, pipe down.  Soon this'll be over, and you can go back  - to your boring little - (farts)  - Uh, hmm. - Was that you, Edith?  - Yes. Excuse me. - Uh-oh.  Take one of your gas pills.  - Hmm. Hush up, Harold! - Okay.  Wait. Gas pills? You mean these?  Hey, how come fatty's got your fart meds?  - Has he got the toots, too? - Harold! (farts)  So you don't really get fits?  I get farts. Close enough!  Is it even true that you're not allowed to drive?  The car's in the shop. Same thing.  (groans) This is incredible. You tricked me.  Do you know how much trouble I could get in, Edith?  Not to mention my family.  My wife is probably worried sick.  - (grunting) - This is the only thing  I care about in this world right now! Eat it!  Both of you, out of the car.  (sighs) Come on, Harold.  Mm, okay.  - Harold, the quilt, the quilt! - Oops.  BOB: Is that your square?  - What's on it? - What do you care?  - It just looks - Incredible?  - Maybe. - It's the freak show.  The freak show?  Yeah. It used to be down at the Wonder Wharf.  It was a big part of this town for years.  That's Two-Faced Tommy, that's Howie the Pinhead,  Bearded Becky, Tattooed Larry  and his companion Pumpkinhead Gary.  There's Righty the Left-Hander. That was freaky back then.  Uh, who's that? The-the little girl?  EDITH: That's, well  That's me. My parents worked on the wharf.  The freaks looked after me, kept me out of trouble.  But Lillian thinks the freaks  don't belong on the town's history quilt.  She thinks they're shameful.  Just 'cause their nipples are three times as long as ours.  Well, that one guy, at least.  Yeah, that's, uh, kind of sweet. I-I don't know what to say.  Go home, Bob. Harold and I will take the bus.  (sighs) No, you won't.  Get back in the car, both of you.  What? I just got out of the car.  Do you know how hard it is for me to get in and out of cars?  - Harold, do what the man said! - All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Don't thank me, Edith. Well, you know what?  - Thank me. - Yeah, I just did.  Stop flirting with my wife. She's spoken for!  Take the long way to the Arts Center.  Harold needs more time. He's a slow sew.  I am not.  All right, I'll take the long way.  But I'm worried Bosco's looking for us. Keep your eyes peeled.  Is that a joke about my cataracts?  - No, but that's kind of funny. - Ha.  - It's closed. I give up. - Oh, of course you do.  Who are you calling? Cab, hopefully?  The other quilters.  I think I know where that crazy bag of bones is heading.  Get in the car. We're going to the Wharf Arts Center.  I'll just do all my other police work later, I guess.  Last present. Ooh, look at the light.  - Everyone, gather up. - (sighs)  Colton? Nose, finger. Separate them.  Ugh, they're all over him.  - You know what? Enough's enough. - Wait, what?  This one's for you, Colton.  Uh, little girl? Finger?  We got any other pickers at the party? Come on, don't be shy.  Wait, what's-what's going on?  Don't be afraid to double barrel it.  Absolutely not. No double barrel.  - Yes, double barrel. - That's it, that's it!  Nice, uh, house. Tell me about these sconces.  The sconces are from Florence, and there's a whole story there,  but right now you need to tell me  why you're trying to ruin Colton's party.  - It's not my party. - What did you say, sweetie?  The party's really for you guys.  (chuckles): What do you mean?  I think what he means is,  sometimes we do things for our kids,  but they're not really for our kids.  I mean, not that I have kids, that I know of. (chuckles)  Colton's saying this party is one big photo op.  What? That's ridiculous.  Oh, my God, it's true! (crying)  - It is! It is! - You kids don't get it.  I mean, everybody that I work with  has such beautiful photo feeds.  Every weekend, this family's petting a manta ray,  that family's jumping off a dune during a fireworks display.  Where do they find these fireworks dunes?  We're all looking for our fireworks dunes, bro.  So, what are we gonna do here?  All right, Colton, one last gift and no pictures.  Nice.  So we just take pictures with our eyes,  and save them to our brains?  God, the resolution of my eyes is so good.  - You're doing great, guys. - I've been taking pictures  of the inside of my pocket this whole time  and I think I posted them all.  I'm liking them, I'm liking them.  God, we're sick.  (siren wails, tires screech)  Oh, crap. Go, go, go, go!  - Oh, oh, oh, shoot them! - I'm not shooting somebody  because my mother tells me to, again.  - Ugh, these bozos. - There's the quilt thief.  - The quief. - Bob Belcher?  I thought that was your car. I didn't figure you for a quief.  Stop saying that like it means ""quilt thief.""  Hi. I'm the director of exhibitions.  The sewing ceremony for the quilt celebrating town history,  - is that still happening, or ? - LILLIAN: It's happening.  But this woman will play no part in it.  Hand over the quilt, Edith.  - Come and take it, Lillian. - Yeah, bring it.  Now, now, no need for this to get nasty.  Give the quilt to me, nice and easy.  Wait, everybody. Edith's square, just give it a chance.  Listen, I-I know what Edith did looks bad.  And I know she's difficult, possibly horrible.  And yes, Edith wants to put freaks on the quilt,  and that might not sound very pretty.  Oh, enough! What on earth does Edith see in this man?  But Edith knew the freaks, and they were regular people.  They were good people.  Sometimes we judge people  on what we think we know about them, but that's wrong.  Just take a look at Edith's square.  Beautiful needlework.  Wonderful detail on the nipples.  So, who votes to give this quilt to the Wharf Arts Center?  Do you vote on things?  - No! - We vote.  - Sometimes we vote. - No, we don't!  - All those in favor? - OTHERS: Aye.  All those opposed? Nay!  Sorry, Lillian. Looks like the freaks stay on the quilt.  Staying on the quilt!  - Yes! - Uh, Bob?  My mom's all riled up about this.  I was wondering if, uh, you could help me out?  Get in the car, perp.  You're making a big mistake, Bosco.  Yeah, we're not going quietly.  Punk-ass Po-Po.  Thanks. I'll drive you around for a while,  then drop you off somewhere inconvenient.  And let that be a lesson to you crazy quiefs.  So you spent your whole day with Edith?  - How was that? - Actually great.  You guys spent your whole day at that weird party. How was that?  It was medium fun, actually. I may take up nose picking.  - Godspeed. - I had a big day, too.  I taught Teddy how to stop hating sushi.  Really? How-how'd you do that?  Well, I mean, I kind of taught him.  Great place. So glad we're eating here.  And I-I will have some sushi.  Mmm.  Ow. What the ?  Ooh, guacamole!  (shouts, grunts) Oh, God!  I've been drivin' all night, my hand's wet on the wheel   There's a voice in my head that drives my heel   It's my baby callin', says, ""I need you here""   It's a half past 4:00, and I'm shiftin' gear   We've got a thing that's called radar love   We've got a wave in the air   Radar love."
"1   Okay, looking good in your little brine bath, buddy.  And tomorrow, somebody's gonna be  the most delicious Thanksgiving turkey ever.  (high-pitched): ""Is it me?""  Sure is, pal.  (bashful chuckle)  All right, I'll check in on you after we get back from the turkey pardoning,  since our town is doing that now.  ""Turkey pardoning?""  I know, right? So dumb.  Treating the turkey like it's a person.  ""Yeah, idiots! Wait, but don't you""  Shh, shh. No, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.  Ugh, I still can't believe we're wasting  our half day off school to go see a turkey pardoning.  That I do not pardon.  Yeah, the only Parton I need to see is Dolly.  Come on, it'll be fun.  We're gonna go to city hall. We're gonna see the mayor.  The mayor!  Why-why do you love the mayor so much?  What are you talking about? He's the mayor.  He wears those shirts, and he's always waving.  - Oh, he's got a great wave. - It is a good wave.  - He really gets into it. - It's like his whole body's waving.  He doesn't have any bones. He's like a fish.  - Fish have bones. - They do?  Uh, yeah.  I think the pardoning sounds nice.  Giving the turkey a second chance at life  after being locked up.  The turkey hasn't been to prison.  - What are you, his lawyer? - Ugh.  The live turkeys are the worst.  Those flesh-mangling beaks and those beady eyes?  Also, how can you trust an animal with a head that's that bald and tiny?  I mean, we trust Dad.  - That's true. - Mm.  All right, people, let's go.  - We're losing daylight. - Cranberries!  - Language. - No,  I forgot cranberries for the cranberry sauce.  We-we got to go to the store after the thing and get them.  Or we could just buy canned cranberry sauce this year.  Yeah. I love big cans. (growls)  What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I know  you ate that sugary canned cranberry slop  at your grandmother's that one year,  'cause she doesn't care about anything.  - Watch it. - But we are not eating that junk in the house.  This is a fresh cranberry sauce house, damn it.  It's who we are!  I like the shape it makes when it comes out of the can.  - So help me, Tina. - Sorry.  LINDA: Ugh. They're an hour late.  And what's with the lousy turnout?  This is the mayor's first turkey pardoning.  - Where's the freaking support? - Maybe everyone came down  with a bad case of ""I'd rather be anywhere else""?  - (chuckles) Nice. - (chuckles)  Stop it. No high-fiving.  Ooh! Here comes someone.  Hello, everyone. Uh, sorry for the delay.  I'm afraid there's been a change of plans. (chuckles)  The mayor had to not be here.  He had a mayor emergency.  An e-mayor-gency. Uh  What? An e-mayor-gency? No!  But, uh, what's almost as good as the mayor?  - LINDA: Nothing! - Okay.  - Linda, please stop. - You stop.  The deputy mayor.  So, may I present to you  Deputy Mayor Daniel Cunningham.  (chuckles) Hello. Thank you.  Hey, why don't we give  a big thanks to the person who organized this whole event?  Oh, right, it was me.  Yeah, the mayor delegated it all to me  no big deal and he's sorry he couldn't be here today.  Though not as sorry as his toilet.  #StomachProblems.  How dare he hashtag my mayor's stomach problems.  Okay. Let's bring up the star of the show,  Drew P. Neck!  (gobbles)  - Ugh. - I think he's cute.  Go for it, sister. I don't see a ring.  And after lucky little Drew P. Neck here gets pardoned,  he's going to live out his days peacefully  at the Old McDonald Had a Sanctuary Sanctuary,  where the motto is ""E-I-E-I Hope.""  Okay, who wants to go stare at the broken fountain  - that's never worked? - Ooh, me.  We're having a good childhood.  Hey, cool press badge.  - Are you in the press? - Uh, yeah.  - I knew it. - So you actually have to report  - on this crap show? - I know, right?  Why can't I be covering a pre-Thanksgiving armed robbery?  Or maybe, like, one little stabbing.  If you give me your pen, I could stab you in the bottom.  That's very generous, but, no, thank you.  LOUISE: Well, we're doing it.  We're staring at the broken fountain.  (whistles) Does not disappoint.  WOMAN: Well, dum-dum Deputy Mayor Cunningham  just had the sanctuary idea yesterday, Mom.  And the one he picked can't take the turkey.  They're at capacity. I told you already.  What's going on here? Gene, Tina, let's drop some eaves.  Well, he told me to drive it to a (whispers): slaughterhouse.  A slaughterhouse? That doesn't sound good.  Maybe she meant ""cider house."" That place rules.  I can't just let the turkey go. It's the most famous bird  in the county. It'll be recognized.  No, I'm not just gonna murder it and bury it in the woods.  Oh, my sister could do it?  Well, I'm not Lisa!  Look, I'll get home as soon as I can,  but now I have to drive a turkey to a slaughterhouse  because my career in politics is going really great!  So the sanctuary stuff is just a lie?  They're taking Drew P. Neck to a slaughterhouse?  This is, like, a serious scandal.  Eh, I wouldn't really call it a scandal.  It's scand-ish.  A Scand-ish-navian, if you will.  Oh, let's go tell the reporter guy!  Reporters love reporting stuff.  Uh, no.  What? What do you mean, no?  Yeah. I don't take tips from kids anymore.  Not since my niece told me about a homework burglar.  Turns out she's just a terrible student and person.  Now, if you'll excuse me, bye.  Aah! We got to help Drew P.!  What are we gonna do?  Well, we could do nothing?  - Maybe try that? - Nothing sounds good.  No, we got to save him.  Or we don't. 'Cause he's nasty.  Or we go on a full-on rescue mission.  Hmm. Rescue mission.  I kind of like the sound of that.  Yes. A turkey rescue mission.  I don't like the ""turkey"" part.  All right, just a rescue mission.  - Okay, fine, I'm in. - For a turkey.  I'm in, too. I promised Ken I'd help him move today,  but screw it. I don't know why I told him I have a Toyota Tacoma.  And so, Drew P. Neck,  I hereby pardon you from the Thanksgiving table.  Now, let's get you to that sanctuary, huh?  We don't have much time. Let's go tell Mom and Dad.  Or as I call them, Panache and The 'Stache.  Okay, I'll take a few questions.  You guys have all your little recorder thingies out?  Uh, you, in the pants.  Will there be a photo op at the sanctuary later today?  (whispers) That's a stupid question.  Uh, a photo? There? At the sanctuary?  I will have to check about that.  (imitates phone chime) Oh, I'm getting a text.  Ooh, from the government.  I've got to go, I'm sorry. Good-bye.  Bless you all. Bye-bye.  Hmm. Interesting.  That dirty deputy mayor!  You know, if the real mayor weren't out of his mind  with diarrhea right now, none of this would have happened.  So, can we save Drew P. Neck?  I don't know. This all sounds crazy.  I have an idea: we get justice by going to the store  and buying cranberries.  Bob, we got to save the turkey.  To protect the mayor's legacy.  We can't let them taint it.  - GENE: Yeah, a mayor's taint is sacred. - Gene.  Look, guys, we don't even know where Drew P. Neck is right now, so  - Great. - Come on, Dad, please?  Do something with your life for once.  (sighs) Okay, fine.  - All right! - Hooray! - Yeah!  This is a terrible idea.  LOUISE: What? No.  Family turkey rescue?  Well, somebody better call Huey Lewis,  because I may have found myself some news.  - I got eyes on her. I got eyes on her! - She's right in front of us.  - Right. - So, I know no one cares what I think,  but I would just like to say, first of all,  I'm not convinced that you heard  what you thought you heard on that phone call.  This lady may be just driving the turkey to that sanctuary right now.  I mean, you guys aren't the best listeners.  - You say something, Pop? - And second of all,  even if it is all true, what, exactly, is our plan here, anyway?  Run this lady off the road, grab the turkey.  - You know, standard stuff. - (grunts)  And then we got to set Drew P. Neck free.  Somewhere peaceful, on a hill, with a turkey house  and a white picket turkey fence.  And water-efficient landscaping.  BOB: And we're getting on the highway.  By the way, you're all hypocrites.  You know we're gonna eat a turkey tomorrow, right?  Eat the hell out of it.  But, Dad, when we pardoned Drew P. Neck, we promised him he'd live.  We have to keep our word. I mean, what?  We're gonna start lying to turkeys now?  You think that's pretty cool, Dad?!  We're keeping our word   We're saving the bird this year.   - BOB: Okay, I'm getting off. - LINDA: What?  - TINA: No, no, no, no, no - LOUISE: Aw, come on!  We're going to the store to get cranberries.  Sometimes I get to do what I want to do.  - No, you don't, ever! - Pinch him, kids.  (pained grunts)  GENE: Let me at those nips.  All right, fine.  - (horn blaring) - Ah  - (tires screeching) - BOB: Oh, wonderful.  TINA: Dad, it's actually pretty dangerous  to stop your car here.  - BOB: I know that, Tina! - LOUISE: Wow.  Did that whole family give you the finger?  - Even the baby. - Aw, little finger.  LOUISE: Well, we lost her.  - Great work, Cranberry Cathy. - Oh, look, that's her car.  Pull in, Dad.  Well, now what?  I think our only option is to clock her over the head  with a potted plant or a tiny piano or something,  and then grab the turkey.  Maybe that could work.  - Lin. - What?  Look, she's going inside.  GENE: Just like she always does.  If we had a brick, we could throw it through the car window.  - No. - You're being very negative, Bob.  No one is breaking into anything.  We still don't even know if any of this so-called conspiracy is even true.  Now, I'm gonna go into that little market  and see if maybe, somehow, they have cranberries.  And then, when that lady gets back to her car,  we will talk to her.  So, repeat after me: ""I'm not going to break into that vehicle.""  ALL: I'm not going to break into that vehicle.  I was hoping I would never have to  force this family to say that, but here we are.  Cranberries? What do you want them for?  To make cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving.  Cranberry sauce comes in a can.  I mean, no, it comes from cranberries.  But you can get it in a can, yes,  if you're hollow inside and your heart is dead.  - Uh, we got raisins. - Thanks for the help.  WOMAN: Yes, I'll head over there after I take the turkey to the  (whispers): slaughterhouse.  Yes, I was just going to the bathroom.  I know I pee loud!  Oh, my God, she is taking Drew P. Neck to the slaughterhouse.  Mm, don't know what you're saying now.  Never mind, I got to go. Bye.  Hey, what happened to the whole not breaking into the vehicle thing?  We're not breaking in, Bob.  Yeah, Dad, it's the sunroof rule.  ""If it's open for sun, it's open for fun.""  Oh, I can smell why she left it open.  - More like ""turd"" is the word. - (gobbles)  Oh, God, I-I guess we're doing this.  I guess we're saving this turkey.  Attaboy, Bobby, you're finally on the right side of history.  Okay, let's get out of here.  - (all gasp) - Wait, is that the reporter guy?  Ta-da! It's Ralph.  I was in disguise as an off-duty baseball player.  - I almost hit you with my car. - You sure did.  Now, look, you kids were right about this scandal,  and now, I've got the deputy mayor's aide  talking about it on tape.  - So, I owe you an apology. - Mm-hmm.  - Oh, that's nice. - Yeah, you do.  And you owe me one  for not making me believe you.  So, yeah, that's on you.  Now, can I pop in there and ride along with you guys?  Get some quotes, be embedded right in the S-word.  - Okay. - No, absolutely not.  Yes. Come on, Bob, let him come.  Think of the headline. ""Family Saves Pooping Mayor  ""from Actions of Poopy Deputy Mayor,  Who is a Big Pile of Poops."" Right, Ralph?  Huh, that's pretty good. Let me write that down.  (sighs) All right, fine.  Just get in, and let's go.  Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  What the Ralph, what are you doing here?  Wait, is-is that the  I'll tell you what I'm doing here, Marsha.  I'm exposing your scandalous lies.  And by the way, I got 'em all on tape.  Now, drive, Bob, drive!  Is the back door shut?  No, but it's fine. Go, Bob, go!  Can you just shut it, please?  I-I don't feel comfortable driving with it open.  Damn it, Bob! Drive!  TINA: Also, this is our turkey.  Yeah. James Van Der Beak.  We're just trying to get him back to his creek.  - Okay, everybody just wait. - RALPH: Drive!    Oh, my God. She's coming after us.  She's gonna kill us. She's gonna kill us to cover this all up.  That's what I would do.  You got to lose her, Dad.  I'm trying.  Hold on, everybody!  - Oh, crap! - (screaming)  (gobbling)  Wow. Nice work back there, old man.  Yeah, Bobby. That was hot.  You're a regular Steve the Queen.  It's Steve McQueen.  - No, it's not. - (turkey gobbles)  You're welcome, you beady-eyed bastard.  But this is just a job to me, you hear?  - (gobbles) - Don't sass me.  (gasps) Look. That's where we should set Drew P. Neck free.  BOB: Uh, yeah. Let's do it.  This car is never gonna smell the same again.  Eh, you'll get it back to middle-aged fart smell  - soon enough. - Mm-hmm.  Oh, God. So tired. So sweaty.  That's what we'll put on your tombstone.  Marsha! Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!  All right, you know what?  Why don't we just try talking to her?  Oh, yeah, sure. That's a good plan.  ""Hey, I'm Bob. Can we talk?  ""Why are you putting those black leather gloves on?  ""Oh, you're choking me! You're choking me!  (choking): Get off me! I'm dead.""  That could totally happen, Bob.  I'm pretty sure Marsha has gloves.  Okay, fine. Let's just go.  TINA: Here. This is perfect.  Oh, thank God.  - Bye, bye, birdie. - (panting) Stop!  - Don't do this! - Too late.  Today, Drew Patrick Neck is free as a bird.  Please don't strangle us.  - Huh? - (yipping)  What's that?  Uh, guys, I'm pretty sure that's coyotes.  - (Linda gasps) - Oh, my God.  - (coyotes yipping) - Okay, so, that's not gonna  - be great for a turkey. - No, not really.  I guess it's in Mother Nature's cruel hands now.  Eh, Drew's fine.  If Wile E. Coyote taught us anything,  those rascals are blowing themselves up with their own dynamite as we speak.  - We got to go find him. - Do we, though?  Is it still a rescue story if the rescuee is torn to shreds?  I feel like it isn't.  (sighs) Okay, let's just go find the turkey,  since that's what we do now.  Okay, let's go.  I mean, whatever. I'm breezy.  Wait! Don't! You, um,  you all dropped your wallets. Uh  I just have to say that you, madam,  are not fit to wipe the mayor's sick bottom.  Not that getting some help with wiping is a bad thing.  And I still have your taped conversation, Marsha. So, boom.  Ralph, you cannot run this story.  Oh, he's running the story, Marsha.  That's right. And there's not a single thing  you can do about it.  What about an exclusive interview with the mayor?  Well, that is something that you could do about it.  - I would like that. - What? Ralph, no.  How exclusive are we talking? Super exclusive?  Super duper exclusive.  - Oh, wow. - Ralph, if you run that story,  we will give you free burgers at our restaurant for a month.  And also a free hot French fry massage,  which is something I've been workshopping,  and it's going pretty well.  - Dad. - Yeah, Tina?  Have you ever fought a hungry pack of coyotes?  - Um No. - Damn.  What are you even supposed to do when you see a coyote?  Uh, I don't know. I-I think you're supposed  to use your body to scare it, maybe.  You should probably take off your shirt, then,  and really freak him out.  - Louise. - What?  (whispering): Look. Coyotes.  (Tina gasps)  Dad, go save him.  Yeah. Um Here I Here I go.  Okay. Go ahead.  Yep. I'm going.  Dad, you're not moving.  Am, uh, am I not? That's weird, I thought my legs were moving.  - Would it helped if I pushed you? - I-I don't  - I don't think so, Tina. - (grunting)  Uh, Tina, stop. Don't push me.  Guys, he's just a dumb turkey.  He's not worth getting maimed or coyote-uglied over.  This is the law of the woods.  I mean, coyotes have to eat  Oh, my God! What am I saying? Get the hell away  from Drew P. Neck, you sons of bitches!  - (screaming) - No, Louise!  (panting) Whoa. Louise.  (panting)  I-I guess you got that one.  - (panting) - Uh, I'll get the next turkey  that's being attacked by coyotes.  - Sure. - But that was good, though.  It was actually what exactly what I was gonna do.  MARSHA: Great. You found him.  That's That's what we wanted. (chuckles)  So, uh, Ralph, uh, super duper exclusive interview with the mayor?  - Be strong, Ralph. - Sorry, Marsha.  - No deal. - Yes!  A ""turkey pardon cover-up,""  plus ""little girl saves turkey from a pack of coyotes""?  That's what we call in the journalism biz  a ""Scoop There It Is.""  Plus this lady right here offered me a month  - of free burgers, so - Excuse me?  - Bob, shush, shush, shush. - MARSHA: Well, great.  This cover-up is going just great.  Oh, I'm a terrible cover-upper.  Aw. No.  - No, I am. I am. - I mean, yeah.  So, I have a question.  What are we gonna do with this turkey now?  Actually, I have an idea.  It's me. Marsha. From work.  BOB: Is this it?  Wait a second. Is that a two-butted goat?  - LOUISE: Sure is. - GENE: A butt so nice, he has one twice.  - (screaming) - I really don't like when people do that.  LOUISE: Deputy Mayor Cunningham?  Okay, now we're gonna get murdered.  Oh, my God. Okay, okay.  Everybody, uh, just play dead  and maybe he'll go away. Like this. (groans)  Um, hello? Deputy Mayor Cunningham here.  Just want to say, not gonna murder you,  'cause not in this suit. (laughs)  Uh, h-how did you know we were coming here?  Hi.  Marsha! You told him.  But how did you know we were coming here?  'Cause you talked about it right in front of me.  Oh, yeah. We did.  You told us how to get to route five.  - Yeah. - Thanks again. Good directions.  - You're welcome. - TINA: Don't try to stop us,  Deputy Mayor Man. We're giving Drew P. Neck  to this farm to live out his days peacefully.  Yeah. He's gonna live with Double Butt.  It's gonna be like that show Three's Company,  - but with butts. - Oh, I'm falling.  Sorry, but the farmer's not home.  He must be out night-farming.  - Crap. - Damn it. - Nice.  It's over, Cunningham.  I'm turning in my story, and you are about to be  the deputy mayor of your mom's house.  Ooh. So sorry, Ralph.  You see, you recorded a private conversation  without Marsha's permission.  So unless you want to get sued, you're gonna need that.  Damn it. I do hate getting sued.  Yeah. It's not fun.  So how about I just take that turkey off your hands?  - No. - (grunting)  Pinch posse, attack!  Ow.  - Kids, stop it. - Get him!  - That is my nipple. - GENE: Just a few more hours  of this and you'll be dead.  Now. Good evening, everyone.  And may God bless America.  Marsha, skedaddle. Go, go, go.  Wait, Marsha. Stop.  Look, today has been awful for many reasons.  We could've had a great afternoon buying cranberries,  but instead we did this.  And the worst part of it is, I really don't want  my kids to think this is how the world works.  That people don't keep their word.  Even if it is to turkeys.  So please, do the right thing.  Also, your job seems horrible.  I'm just saying, I'm not judging.  Well, too bad Marsha doesn't give a rip.  Mom, I'll be there in a few hours.  And by the way, I'm quitting.  - All right. - Yes. - Yeah, Marsha!  - But, but - Oh, uh, she wants to talk to you?  I don't want to (sighs) Hello?  Hey, now. Okay, there's no need for that kind of langua  I will not go to hell.  I am going to heaven. Good day.  What's going on? What'd I miss?  I got lost in the damn corn maze again.  Oh! Hey, kids. I remember you.  Hello, Mr. Farmer. We'd like to present you with this turkey.  Oh, to eat? Thanks. Okay, bye.  Oh, no. We were thinking you could, like,  raise it as your pet, or your child.  Yeah, we know he only has one butt,  but maybe you can make an exception?  Oh, uh Yeah. Sure.  Um, to be clear you're not gonna eat him, right?  'Cause we went to a lot of trouble and  Yeah, yeah. Got it. I won't eat him. Sheesh.  So can we go home now?  Ugh. You love going home.  I call way back. I'm gonna start typing out my story on my phone.  Hey, Bob. Can you do me a favor  and just drive a little bit better this time?  What? We were in a high-speed chase.  Yeah, I know. There's just a lot  of zigging and zagging all over the place.  If you could just smooth it out for me.  - (groans) - Hey. Ralph.  How do you now they'll print it?  What's that? My story? Well, they have a printer, so  Yeah, yeah. But how do you know they'll print it?  I think he's trying to say, Ralph,  that he has some way of killing your story.  Um, that's what I'm picking up.  No, I think he's just interested in the printing process.  No, you Let me put it this way: I am the deputy mayor.  When I say ""kill a story,"" they say, ""how high?""  This story is officially D-E-A  - Oh, they printed it. - Huh. I guess Cunningham  doesn't have as much pull at the paper as he thought he did.  Yeah, he's not the mayor. He's the deputy.  They even let dogs be deputies.  This is so exciting. I mean, it's on page 11  and Ralph spelled our name ""Blecher,"" but still.  I've never figured out how the heck it's spelled.  We did good. Thanksgiving?  More like You're Welcome-ivigiving.  Dad, this cranberry sauce looks great.  I don't even miss the can shape, much.  I just can't believe that farmer had a cranberry bog.  And he let me in that cranberry bog.  But I mean, I played it pretty cool.  They're so fresh! They're so fresh!  Okay, okay. Chill out.  All right. Time for one of my famous Thanksgiving speeches.  Hold on. I wrote something down this year.  Uh, ""You know, when I was growing up""  - Dad. Uh, Dad? - Huh?  - Yeah. - I'd like the floor, if I may.  - Um, uh, just uh, yeah. - You're done, right?  - Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Okay, great.  I was just gonna put this away. Yeah.  I used to think turkeys were nasty and horrible.  But then I-I met someone  that taught me that maybe they're not so bad.  - Was that someone me? Oh. - No.  It was Drew P. Neck. And so, on behalf of him,  I'd like to pardon this turkey right now.  Aw, that's so sweet.  - I know. - Um, it's already dead.  - Quiet, Bob. - Sorry.  Okay, everybody, let's dig in.  I'm gonna pardon that fool right into my mouth.  It's just not how pardoning works.  Pardon me while I pardon gravy all up in this mamma-jamma.  And get a little onto my knees,  and a little bit all over my neck.  - BOB: Stop, Gene. - LINDA: And I'm gonna pardon  the cork right out of this Pardonnay.  BOB: Okay, well, words have meaning, but whatever.  Let's eat.  LINDA:  We're keeping our word   We're saving the bird this year   Gonna keep our word, gonna save the bird   That's what you heard   We're keeping our word   We're saving the bird this year   Gonna keep our word, gonna save the bird   That's what you heard   Don't you taint my mayor   Don't you taint my mayor   Let him fly   We're saving the bird this year   Gonna keep our word, gonna save the bird   That's what you heard   We're keeping our word, we're saving the bird this year"
"1  LOUISE: Ah, another day, another dollar.  TINA: It's not school if you love what you do.  Guys, I told Alex I'd wait for him.  Uh, are you two gonna play that interesting,  not-embarrassing game you made up?  What's it called? Robot Something Basement Time?  RoboWizard Quest. There he is.  - Alex! - (panting)  I tried to run here to meet you,  but it turns out I run slower than I walk,  which was, um, was a letdown, I'll be honest.  COURTNEY: Gene. Oh, Gene! Gene.  Oh, hey, Courtney. Doug.  Gene, Courtney has a little favor to ask you.  Uh, okay. What is it?  It's a favor.  Courtney, get in jump position.  Um, what are we, what is  I need to see you lift Courtney.  You have to lift me.  Courtney is here, just so,  and, Gene, when she hops up,  you just lift and turn 90 degrees, and then you  - I don't want to lift - No talking!  Gene, shh!  - Lift her! - Lift me!  Courtney, jump. Jump!  - Come on, Gene. - Gene, lift!  - (Gene straining) - Lift me, Gene.  - Come on. - Lift!  - Come on, let's go. - Lift!  Bravo.  - That was really exciting. - Wow.  I wish our dad made people lift us.  - Okay, can I go now? - No.  Courtney's Roller-Dance Pairs Competition partner Kelvin  had to drop out.  His parents' improv troupe is going on tour again.  And her roller-dancing competition is on Saturday.  (whistles) Sounds glamorous.  Oh, it is, honey. The whir of the skates.  The smell of the hairspray. The blood on the wood  My dad was Junior Partners champion in 1983.  - '84! - Sorry, Dad.  God, you get so weird about roller-dancing.  So, Gene, what do you say?  Can we count on you to be our replacement?  I've see you skate at the school skating parties.  You're fine.  We just need a good sturdy boy for Courtney to skate around.  Will you make me the happiest skate dad in the world?  - Uh no. - What?  Sorry, but I'm not the sturdy,  fine-at-skating boy you're looking for.  Now, excuse us, Alex and I  got to go see a robot about a wizard.  - Huh, that is so weird. - Lin, are you still staring  at that woman sitting in her car?  Yeah, she's been there for hours, Bob.  It's so spooky. Ooh.  Uh-huh. Maybe she lives in her car.  In a car like that? No way.  That car is nice. I'd live in that car.  Mm, yeah. She's wearing beautiful sunglasses, too.  They look like Grantlys. Very high-end.  I watch a lot of makeover shows, okay, Bob? Geez.  Okay. (chuckles) I didn't say anything, Teddy.  Yeah, well, you're judgy.  You're making a face. I see it.  Okay, so she's wealthy  and she's been sitting in her car all day.  That's a little weird.  Oh, I know, she's probably here to assassinate one of us,  and she's working up the courage.  - Hmm. Okay, which one of us? - Probably me.  Remember when I got hit on the head a few weeks ago?  Oh, when you walked into a stop sign?  Yeah. I probably got a bad concussion,  and I have amnesia.  And ""amnesia me"" went out at night  and got in a high-stakes poker game and won  thousands of dollars from her with my amnesia poker skills,  so now she wants to kill me.  She wants to rip my friggin' head off.  I bet she just walks in here and does it.  Just like that, dead.  (jingling)  Linda Belcher, now you die.  Aah, she got me, she got me!  TEDDY: Ooh, gun glasses. Exciting.  She's not here to kill you with gun glasses, Lin.  That's so mean, Bob.  -Don't tell me I can't get killed. -(door bells jingle)  Yeah, Bob, don't tell your wife she can't get killed.  - Sorry. - Hey, kids.  - Good day at school? - Oh, yeah.  We all graduated early, and we don't have to go anymore.  Great.  Enough chitchat. RoboWizard Quest calls.  Oh, right, the game. Hi, Alex.  Hey, Mr. Burger.  It's Belcher.  He answers to both. It's fine.  No, I-I don't.  Wait, Tina, Louise, are you guys gonna play, too?  No. We watch and mock it delightfully.  All right, go have fun, kids.  And now the robot chooses a number.  (imitating robot): Choosing.   Oh, 27 is way over there.  And I must get there by hopping  only on circles that add up to less than 27.  (imitating wizard): Or the wizard will be unleashed.  Circles and math. This really is the perfect game.  Okay, here I go.  (grunting): Six.  - 12. - That makes 18.  Wrong. Oh, wait. No, that's right.  Oh, no! I landed on ten.  (laughing) I curse thee.  I curse thee, Gene.  - (moans) - I command you to melt, robot.  - Melt. - No  Hey, kids. Snack time.  All right, here we go with some pretzels and hummus.  Oh, I love hummus.  Hummus, hummus, hummus   It's a yum-mus.   Little bit of a speed bump here.  I can't have hummus.  Why? It's healthy.  I am allergic to sesame.  It gives me, uh, thunder down under.  - Talking about diarrhea. - Cool.  But he's not allergic to our secret handshake.  BOTH (whispering): Secret.  Ooh, great handshake, guys.  TINA: Gene, I don't know if I can wait  while you wait for Alex.  Jimmy Jr. started walking home five minutes ago,  and I like to be exactly two minutes behind him.  I'm sure he'll be here soon.  Courtney, I already told you I'm not doing your roller thing.  (scoffs) We're not here for you. Calm down.  - Um, hi, Gene. - Alex. Finally.  Shall we get down to wizness?  Um, not exactly.  Looks like some lucky duck  is gonna be Courtney's dance partner,  and that two thumbs is me.  - Yay! - What?!  Come on, Alex, let's roll. Get it?  'Cause we're gonna roller skate.  (laughs) Bye, Gene.  No!  My friend. That man took my friend!  Not really. It's not a kidnapping thing.  Keep walking.  Ah! Oh, hey, Gene.  So, I assume it went terribly with Courtney yesterday,  and she was very annoying, and we'll be playing  RoboWizard Quest after school today?  No, Gene, I, uh It was great.  There was a lot of, um, touching.  Wait, do you like-like Courtney?  No! I mean, yes.  Not so much Courtney, per Se, just, I mean,  I like-like every girl in our grade.  And Strawberry Shortcake.  I know she's not real, but my feelings for her are.  So, you want to roller-dance, instead of playing the game?  Oh, uh, Gene, Gene, Gene, it's just  no girl ever has asked me to do anything before.  Plus, my mom is really excited that I'm getting exercise.  Even though mostly, I just stand there while Courtney  skates around and then I try to lift her.  But it's hard, because the doctor actually diagnosed  -my arms with mainly calf muscles. -Huh.  Alex! (grunts)  Hey, you're supposed to catch me.  Oh, was I? I-I'm sorry.  Don't be silly. I was joking, partner.  I mean, if you did catch me, it would be pretty cool,  but it's okay. Oh, hi, Gene.  Hi. So Alex, why don't we head to lunch?  Sorry, Gene, he can't.  The competition's in three days, so Daddy said  we have to verbally rehearse at all times.  And a-one, two, three, four.  -Arabesque, arabesque. -Jazz hands in place. Jazz hands.  - Stand in place, stand in place. - Chasse and toe-loop.  - Here we go. - No jazz hands.  I hear the ticking of the clock   I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark   Clockwise circle spin.  Stand and clap.  I wonder where you are tonight   No answer on the telephone   And, half-loop.  And the night goes by so very slow   Oh, I hope that it won't end though   Alone   Enthusiastic snap and tap.  Till now, I always got by on my own   I never really cared until I met you   And now, it chills me to the bone   How do I get you alone?   How do I get you alone?   What?  (whispers): Bob, Teddy. She's back.  The lady in the car.  And she is definitely staring at me.  Creepy. You know what I think she is?  She's one of those ghosts who doesn't know she's dead.  Oh, you mean dumb ghosts?  Happens all the time. Probably, her husband got killed  right out there on the sidewalk, right?  Just walking along and, boom, attacked and killed by a tiger.  -But isn't she supposed to be the ghost? -Yes, Bob.  She died many years later, of natural causes.  But she never got over her husband's tiger death,  so she just sits there in her car, waiting to see him.  And she never gets to exercise so she put on ten ghost pounds.  (sighs) Both of you are nuts. Oh, wait.  She's getting out of her car, and she's coming over here.  - She's walking so slow. - Yeah, ghost steps.  She's not a ghost, Teddy.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  - Okay, that was actually weird. - I told you, Bob.  Ooh, is her car a ghost, too? Teddy, what do you think?  - Ghost car. Ghost car. - Oh, my god.  BOB: Gene, you all right there, pal?  That's macaroni and cheese and you are not eating it.  You okay, my baby? Let me feel your forehead.  (sighs) I'm not sick, I'm just, I don't know.  His BFF up and BF-left.  Oh, no. Did you and Alex friend-break-up?  I don't want to talk about it.  Alex agreed to be Courtney's roller-dancing partner,  so now Gene has to be the wizard and the robot  and the saddest boy in the basement.  Aw. Don't worry, I know a good friend for you, Gene.  She's about this tall and her name is Mommy.  (sighs) But Alex and I had something special.  And now he just wants to be with Courtney and it's all over.  Well, maybe you should just go down to the roller rink  and support Alex.  You could cheer for them or whatever.  You know, that is really good advice.  It is? I mean, yeah, I-I-I give good advice.  And girls, you go with him and be his wing ma'ams.  I wouldn't mind seeing if there are any  teens in jeans down there.  And I could lose thousands of dollars  in the claw machine.  (sighs) I guess I could go.  - There's my boy. - That's the spirit.  Now, how about having some dinn  Oh, you're-you're eating. Maybe slow down?  Never mind, u-uh, do your thing.  Look at him go.  No, no!  I said cross-hands. Like that. Cross-hands.  - It's right there in the name. - ALEX'S MOM: Alex, honey?  Do you need a healthy snack?  How about some seaweed sheets?  Mrs. Papasian, please!  If he's got low blood sugar, he loses focus!  I have some sprouted cashews right here  He does not need sprouted cashews!  Mrs. Papasian, may I speak with you  over near the skate rental counter?  W-Whoa! (grunts)  Ow Gene?  Gene? Why are you here? Are you here to mop?  Hey, Alex, I thought if you had any downtime,  we could play our game right here at the rink.  Let me just tape a couple of circles over here  Gene, no. I can play that with you later.  I'm here with Courtney and she's dancing with me and her dad  is yelling at me, and why can't you just let me  enjoy myself? Please.  So apparently, I'm just going to sit here  and quietly support you, honey.  All right, back to it, guys.  Gene? Did you change your mind? What are you doing here?  - Nothing. - You don't deserve my brother.  Yeah, what she said. But also, I'm just gonna  get the mop because we need it, um, at the restaurant. Bye.  - (doorbell rings) - ALL: Not it.  - Feet hurt. - Huh. Maybe it's Alex.  Maybe I got through to him and he feels bad,  and he quit roller-dance, and he came to apologize.  See? I knew you guys would work it out  because I'm great at advice.  Yeah, you are. And at rubbing my feet.  (sighs) Fine. Give them to me.  Yay! (laughs)  - Oh, that tickles. - Ugh.  Doug?  Hello, Gene. I have a proposition for you.  (thunder crashes)  I need you to help me make Alex disappear.  No! Yes! What? Maybe. Explain yourself?  Make Alex disappear? Why?  Because Courtney will never win with him, Gene.  He can barely lift her, his claps are weak  and his mother's no walk in the park, either.  True. But no offense, I don't care if they win or lose.  I know. Only I care if she wins.  But you should care that you could lose Alex forever.  No one knows what that's like better than me.  In the year 1984, I was on top of the world,   with my best friend Charlie Cross.  And then he met a girl skater named Sharon.  He started skating with her,  and we were never friends again.  -Huh. -And now they've been married for 30 years.  - It's awful! - Yuck.  Yeah. So you got to step in, pal.  Get Alex out of there and bring that trophy home.  I mean, not really, I'll bring it home. Don't touch it!  Don't touch the trophy. And then, I promise you,  I will find her a partner for the next competition,  and you and Alex can go right back to doing  whatever the hell you want.  (moans) Fine. I'll do it.  (chuckles): Attaboy. There's got to be something  that you know that we can use against him.  Well, sesame gives him diarrhea.  Yes, that's perfect.  You can put some in a drink or something  and give it to him right before showtime.  - Me? - Yes. It would be too suspicious  if it came from me.  Then, when he gets the runs, you run to the rescue.  Don't I need to, like, learn the routine?  You just need to nail the lift, which I know you can do.  See you at 10:00 a.m. sharp.  - LOUISE: Gene. - Ah! Wait.  How much of that did you hear?  All of it. I can't believe you're gonna give Alex diarrhea.  I mean, it's hilarious, but I thought you liked him.  Yeah, you're not really gonna do that, right, Gene?  Damn right I am, sister. I'll do whatever it takes  to get my buddy back, including making him diarrhea himself  at a roller rink.  It's really the only way to show someone you care.  I know.  Good morning, kids. Who's excited to wipe down menus?  I don't know, a psychopath?  Kids, it's Saturday, which means we might get customers,  so we might need your help.  But Dad, we're taking your advice and going to support Alex  and Courtney in their roller-dancing competition.  Oh, wow. Yeah. Great.  Since it was my advice, you should probably go.  Yep. And we aren't going there to try to stop Gene  from doing anything bad to Alex at all.  Okay.  Aw, my little supportive seagulls.  And I want to bring Alex his favorite drink,  which is anything that has sugar in it.  Mother, may I have a brown soda to go?  -Of course. -Um, w-what's in your hand, Gene?  A spoonful of hummus. No reason.  Ooh, fun. Walking hummus. I love it.  That seems (groans) Just bring the spoon back.  Oh, and you should probably give me 100 quarters.  - Here's three. - Mm.  Have fun, kids.  All right, time to get my paws on some claws.  Good luck ruining Alex's life and/or outfit, Gene.  Gene, are you sure you want to do this?  If you give Alex hot sesame squirts and he finds out,  he may never forgive you.  It's a chance I got to take, Tina.  Gene.  Hi, how are you? Welcome.  Roller rinks, huh? Lot of fun?  (gasps) She's back!  BOB: Something weird is definitely going on.  - LINDA: She's coming our way. - TEDDY: W-What should we do?  Nothing. She's just a person, Teddy.  Yeah, I'm not taking any chances, Bobby.  This is it. She's really coming this time.  Nope. No, back to the car.  Wait, wait, she's coming back again.  TEDDY: What's happening out there? You guys alive?  Nope, nope, never mind. There she goes again.  - Oh, okay, that's it. - Bob, what are you doing?  - I'm gonna go talk to her. - TEDDY: Don't do it, Bobby!  I'll be fine, Teddy. I'm just gonna figure out  - what's going on. - Okay,  but if she starts dragging you to Hell, give me a signal.  - Like this. - That's just waving.  - Okay, like this. - Perfect.  Huh?  Hi. Uh, I work at that restaurant right there.  My name is Bob and, um,  I just wanted to check and see if everything is okay?  Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm Brenda, and I  (crying)  I only have, have to go into one public place,  and I can't even do it!  I'm a little confused.  I'm agoraphobic, and my doctor wants me to face my fears  by going into a public place.  So, I chose your restaurant to go into  because it's usually pretty empty. No offense.  No, it's okay. It's true.  But I'm just too nervous.  What if there's a fire and then I get trapped in there,  and then I'm trampled,  and what if the lady in the glasses hits me?  No, that's my wife. She won't hit you, I don't think.  -Oh, God! -No, I mean, she definitely won't.  L-Look, would it help if I walked you in?  I-I don't know. Maybe that could work.  Li-Lin. (shushing)  Just be calm. Please, be calm.  -Hi! -(screams) -Oh, God!  What's the matter? What's the matter?  - What'd I do? What'd I do? - No, no, no, no  Oh. Hey, Gene.  Hey. Sorry about the other day.  Oh, that's okay. I freak out a lot, too.  Cool, well, I brought you a soda for good luck.  Wow. Hey, thanks, Gene.  Actually, um, I'm sorry  I stopped playing RoboWizard Quest with you.  I just got so excited to be around a girl.  Thanks for understanding. You're a good friend.  I mean, probably my best friend.  (coughs)  - No! - What the heck, Gene?  I'm a bad friend!  What? What's going on?  Alex, I was gonna trick you and make you drink sesame stuff  so that you'd get diarrhea and then I could take your place  as Courtney's partner because Doug wanted me to  because you can't lift Courtney and your claps are weak,  so I said I would do it, but I can't do it!  I don't want to give you diarrhea. I'm sorry!  Gene, I am mad that you wanted to give me diarrhea,  but I'm really happy that you decided not to do it.  'Cause Gene, it is a mess.  - Friends? - Friends.  (both grunting)  Hey, you know what? Maybe you should replace me.  I like trying to lift Courtney, but I am not good at it.  I mean, I did it once, for a second,  but then we both fell over.  And actually, her knee fell on my mouth.  And also, my claps are weak. See?  - Huh. - Here. All the way back. And  Wow. Yeah. There was literally no sound.  But I still don't think I should replace you.  I've got a better idea. Let's go find Courtney.  LINDA: Agoraphobia?  -Yes, Lin. -But we don't have spiders in here.  - No, that's arachnophobia. - Oh.  She's afraid of public spaces and people.  - Oh, like Howard Huge. - Hughes.  - Yeah. What did I say? - (sighs) Huge.  - Huge. - Oh, my God. All right.  Let's try to focus here, guys. All right?  We need to help Brenda and she agreed to come back  on a few conditions, and I need you guys to listen.  I'm gonna open the door and give her a wave,  and then she's gonna come in,  - but you cannot talk to her. - You got that, Teddy?  - Eh - Neither of you can talk to her.  - And don't look at her, either. - Okay.  I'm just gonna look at this spot right here on the counter.  Wait, where'd it go? Shoot. No, I lost the spot!  -I lost the spot, Bobby! Don't let her in! -Teddy, just calm down.  - Don't let her in! - Calm down.  Okay, you guys are clearly ready,  so let's just do this.  Look away, look away.  (gasping)  (Linda humming)  (Teddy whimpering)  - Hi, I'm Linda! - (shouts)  You know, my cousin's afraid of church bells.  Guys, no.  Oh, no, we blew it.  (door bells jingle)  Thank you. I'll be back tomorrow.  (gasps) We did it! We did it!  Yay! Now she'll never have any more problems.  Yeah, she was kind of annoying, though. Right?  And now taking the stage,  Courtney Wheeler and Alex Papasian.  (laughs) We'll see about that.  Woo-hoo! Alex!    What the H-E-double- roller-hockey-sticks?  Where's Gene?  Come on, stuffed shape with eyes,  - I need you in my life. - Hey, Gene's not out there.  I knew he'd make the right choice.  Yes, shape! I got you.  (gasps)  No, no, no, no, no! Gene, what are you doing?  I'm roller-dancing with my friends, Doug.  You're going to get us disqualified.  It's called doubles, not triples.  I curse thee! I curse thee!  - No, don't curse me. - You're cursed, baby.  You are ruining our dreams,  you smelly little burger boy.  I want to dance with them, Dad.  I don't even like doing this. This is your thing.  Oh, is it?  You tried to get my best friend  to give me diarrhea in front of a girl.  He did what?  -You son of a -Get away! Get away from me, Mrs. Papasian!  - Get away! Get away! - Skate for your life, Doug!  - Whoa. - Yeah.  - (grunting) - I'm flying.  - (panting) - (applause)  Am I crazy, or did we just win?  Uh, no, you definitely did not win.  Please clear the floor.  (imitating robot): You rolled 20.  I can do it. I can do it. Okay.  - 25. - You lose.  (imitating wizard): I curse thee. I curse thee.  You have to melt.  Uh, I'm melting. Ah. I don't know.  - Melt. - I am melting. Trust me.  So, uh, is this game fun?  Once you get to know all the ins and outs,  and the players and the rules, it is not.  I think it looks like a hoot. I want to play next round.  - There's a lot of math. - I'm great at math. Four!  - W-Why did you say four? - It's math.  -Seven! -(chuckles) You're saying numbers,  but that's not necessarily math.  Yeah, but one of them's gonna be right. 12.  If you're rollin' with me   If you want to be my partner   I need you to lift   Lift me up off my feet   I need you to lift me   The rink smells like feet   But you make me complete   I need you to lift me!  I'm flying!  Lift me!  If you're rollin' with me."
"1  (Tina gulping)  Tina, slow down. What's the rush?  Yeah. Savor your cereal, you monster.  I can't look away.  It's like watching a crazed otter.  I just wanna get to school.  Ms. Jacobson is pairing us up  with our Science Fair partners today.  It's fun not knowing who it'll be.  Ooh, exciting.  Will it be a new friend? An old friend?  What if it's Jimmy Junior?  We won't get a lot of work done, if you know what I mean.  Eh? Right?  Mm. I mean, it wouldn't hurt if you got paired  with someone who could get an ""A.""  It's not up to me who I get paired with.  I mean, life is full of possibilities.  Maybe I'll get a good grade in science  Or maybe you'll go to summer school.  Exactly. She gets it.  Plus, grades ain't nothin' but a number.  All right, one more bite and I'm done.  It's time for a great day.  (grunts) I'm okay.  JACOBSON: Who's ready to find out  who their Science Fair partner is?  TINA: Hell, yeah. Uh, I mean, sure.  JACOBSON: Jocelyn, you're with  JOCELYN and TAMMY: Please say Tammy, please say Tammy,  - please say Tammy. - MISS JACOBSON: Jimmy Junior.  JOCELYN: Oh, cool.  And Tammy, you're with Zeke.  - Tamma-lamma-ding-dong. - Ugh.  - JACOBSON: Calm down, Zeke. - (chuckles)  Henry, your partner is  - Actually, I can't have a partner. - What?  I'm not supposed to work with other people.  Here's a doctor's note.  It says I'm not supposed to work with other people.  Seriously?  Uh, I'm sorry, are-are you a doctor?  Fine. You're-You're working alone.  Yes.  - Mmm. That's kinda sad, Henry. - It's not sad, it's medical.  Okay, let's move on. Tina,  you're partners with Susmita.  Nice. What's up, new friend? High five?  I, uh, can't reach.  (straining): Wait, we can do this.  (grunts) We're touching fingers.  That counts. Boom.  I got an idea for a project.  My grandma said all the bees are dying.  We're gonna run outta honey,  and I am not using agave like some idiot.  I've always wanted to know, like,  why birds can fly and not people.  Yeah, and why do birds always look at me weird?  What about peanut butter?  - What about peanut butter? - There's no butter in it,  and yet it's called peanut butter. Pretty crazy, right?  Maybe it's just 'cause it spreads like butter?  Hmm. Yeah.  - So should we just do that? - Well, I've actually always wanted  to build a radio telescope.  Oh. Totally. What is that?  So a radio telescope is like a telescope for your ears.  - Got it. Headphones. - Nope. Not headphones.  Exactly. Keep going.  See, with a bunch of modifications, you can use  a regular home TV satellite dish to study the radio waves  from astronomical objects.  We could build one and point it at the Sun.  I don't know what you just said, but it sounds like an ""A.""  And I'm really embarrassed I suggested  that super cool A-minus peanut butter idea.  So how about since you know how to do all that,  why don't I take care of making us  the best damn Science Fair board you've ever seen?  My bubble letters are amazing.  I mean, they're pretty good.  They're-they're fine.  I might not do bubble letters.  BOB: You want some more coffee, Teddy?  Yeah. Uh, what if it was called sneezey instead of cough-ey?  - Get it, Bob? Get it? - Hmm.  Now I don't wanna give you any more. Ooh, they're here.  You have four more just like that in your truck, right?  And I can't wait to carry them all in here.  - He loves carrying things. - I'm livin' the dream.  BOB: So you know how I've wanted  a coat-rack for the restaurant?  Well, I was shopping online  and I couldn't decide which one to get.  How many coat-racks can there be?  Lin. So many.  Some have circular mounts,  some have tripod stands, some are aluminum.  Some look like actual trees, those are fun.  Okay. So you bought five of 'em?  Yes. Because I'm a brilliant shopper.  They were on sale, so I bought five.  Now I can see them in person,  pick my favorite, and return the other four.  - Genius. - Wait.  - Did you say they were on sale? - Yeah.  And you're sure you can return them?  - Yes. - But they were on sale.  - Wh-what are you getting at? - Show me the website.  Trust me. I definitely wouldn't have bought them  if you couldn't return Oh, no.  No, no, no. I can't return them.  Great. Now we own five coat-racks.  (sighs) Damn it.  Hm. Why-Why are the boxes so small?  You probably have to assemble them. I'm guessing.  - Oh, my God. - It's for kids.  Did you buy five children's coat-racks?  We can't pay for five coat-racks.  I mean, we did. So what do we do?  I guess you're selling 'em.  (sighs) Do you want to buy a tiny coat-rack, Teddy?  Now I bet you wish you'd laughed at my sneezey joke.  (sighs) I do. I really do.  LOUISE: So, you guys are gonna listen to the Sun?  Just don't listen to anything the Moon says; he's a liar.  Quick S.F.Q Science Fair question.  Is there anything else we could listen to besides the sun?  Well, I was gonna use my parents' old TV dish,  but if we had a bigger one, we could listen to planets,  or satellites, or even try to listen for extraterrestrials.  Aliens? Well, yeah, Susmita. Let's do that.  - I mean, we could try. - Wait.  Why are we just gonna sit back and listen for aliens?  Can we send a message out? Can we talk to them?  Well, we don't actually know if anything's out there.  But what if the aliens are out there,  but they're also just sitting back and listening for us?  I mean, if Tom Hanks never sent Meg Ryan that first e-mail,  that movie would have been called You've Got Computer.  'Cause they both would have just been sitting at their computers.  That was the prequel.  I guess if we had a bigger dish,  we could send out a message.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop it.  Whatever you do, do not ""send out a message.""  What? Why not, Henry?  Because we don't want the Earth to be obliterated?  What are you talking about?  If you contact aliens, they will come and destroy us.  What? How do you know they won't be super friendly?  Based on simple probability, there should be at least  a hundred thousand civilizations in our galaxy, right?  And at least a thousand Type III civilizations.  I think you mean diabetes? But go on.  Type III civilizations.  That means that they're billions  of years more advanced than us.  They can harness the energy of the entire galaxy  and travel between stars.  Stars are just like us.  That's right, Jocelyn.  But we haven't met them. Why? Well,  it's probably because one of these civilizations  is massively predatory and is wiping out the rest of them.  Damn those Type III civilizations.  So our only hope of survival is going unnoticed,  so they don't ever find us.  Therefore, do not send out a signal.  This teacher has a point.  What? I'm-I'm not a teacher.  I'm in your grade.  Mm, no. You're a teacher. Trust me.  But you don't know that aliens  are flying around killing everybody.  - Oh, my God. - I mean,  what if they're flying around helping everybody?  Like in a big space ambulance,  and when they get our message, they'll be really excited  to come and see if we need anything.  Yeah, they could be super chill.  I don't know, Tina. I'm kind of on Team Henry with this one.  What if you're the one that ends the world?  You don't wanna be that guy.  What if they want to harvest our penises?  And who would blame them?  Susmita, we're not gonna let this guy scare us  out of a good grade, are we?  Uh I'm not scared if you're not scared.  The only thing I'm scared of  is how much of an ""A"" we're gonna get.  Hmm. ""Meet in Branca's supply closet.""  "" at 2:55.""  HENRY: Thank you for coming. Did anyone follow you?  Gene's fart did. Apparently.  Sorry. I thought I lost it in the hallway, but she found me.  We need to talk.  We have to stop Tina and Susmita, and I have a plan.  But it involves you going against your own sister.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. We would never do that.  - You will be compensated. - We'll do it.  I hope you have connections in the frozen yogurt world,  'cause this boy works strictly for gift cards.  - So this is your dad? - (grunts) I wish.  - He's my dad's friend. - Best friend.  Are you two, uh, best friends?  We're getting there. I mean,  we're pretty great Science Fair partners.  Where'd you get the dish?  I demo'd an old sports bar last week  and they had this thing out back.  I was gonna use it to watch hockey talk shows,  but now it's gonna talk to aliens.  What a life this dish is having.  Eh. (grunting)  And done. (sighs)  So, ready to go?  Should we e-mail some aliens?  Oh, no. We still have a couple  of things to do before we turn it on.  Hey, how's our Science Fair board?  Uh, I'm kicking some serious butt on it, that's how it is.  I haven't started it yet.  Um, but it's gonna be s-so good.  All right, let's get to work.  So what do we do now?  First, we have to teach them our language.  How do we do that?  Make them watch TV all day like the mermaid in Splash?  I was thinking we send a binary code  as a kind of Rosetta stone pictograph.  Hopefully, it can teach them enough to start a conversation.  Sorry, now I'm just thinking about Splash.  And then, to send our message, we use Morse code.  There's also Turner & Hooch. Anything there?  Maybe we should focus on what we're gonna say in our message?  Good point. How do you say ""Tom Hanks"" in Morse code?  Doo. Doo-doo-doo. Doo doo.  Doo-doo-doo-doo. Doo-doo. Doo-doo doo-doo-doo.  - Doo-doo-doo. - Nice.  One burger-of-the-day coming right up.  (clears throat) Uh, tell 'em about our special, Bob.  (sighs) Right, uh, we're also having a special today.  With the purchase of any burger, we'll throw in, uh,  a coat-rack for just $59.  I'm sorry? A-A what?  A-A-A coat-rack.  - Uh, just show him. - Oh. All right.  - Uh, d-do you like this one? - (chuckles) What is that?  Is-Is that a little model of a coat-rack?  No, no, no. This, this is the coat-rack.  Oh. (chuckling) I-I thought it was like  when you go buy a tent and they have a little tiny model  of a tent on display; I-I love those.  Aw. Tiny tents. For little runaway mice.  So how many coat-racks can I put you down for?  I'll tell ya what. If I have a baby  and that baby buys a little coat,  I'll come back in here and get one of your little coat-racks.  Thank you.  Tina and Susmita are still in here.  He's it going out there?  Good. I have to cut the wire going  from their telescope's amplifier to their transmitter.  It'll basically create a private Morse code network  between their telescope and my laptop.  GENE (over walkie-talkie): Just gimme a heads up  when you're outside.  HENRY (on walkie-talkie): I've been outside.  And I've been looking at you this whole time.  Really good job out there, buddy.  They're on the move.  HENRY: I need more time.  - Stall them. - On it.  Classic hall-stall.  Hey, what's up, T? Hi, Susmita.  How's the Science Fair stuff going?  Good. Um, we're kind of in the middle of it right now.  Oh, ho-ho. So cool.  Tell me all about it.  We programmed a message that'll hopefully teach aliens English.  We're about to go send it off.  - Um, see you later. - Wait. I'm so proud of you.  - Oh. - (both grunting)  What are you doing?  Shh. Just ten more seconds.  Get in here, Susmita.  - I'm proud of you, too. (grunts) - (Tina groans)  Uh, okay. Um, bye, Louise.  Thanks for the long hug that kind of hurt.  The possums are out of the trap.  - Get out of there, Haber. - (radio static)  - HENRY: Copy. - Your walkie-talkie is sticky.  HENRY: It's my brother's. He threw up on it.  Yeah, that checks out.  Okay, the Rosetta code is sent.  Now we can follow up with our first message.  Oh, boy.  We just type our message here,  it translates it into Morse code, and then we can send it off.  It'll take about a day  for the message to get out to the edge of our solar system.  And then if somebody is flying by  and gets our message and wants to answer,  it'll take another day before we hear back.  Do you want to write it?  Uh, yeah. Wow.  Man, I don't know what to write.  Lot of pressure. Let's see, uh  ""What's shakin', bacon?  ""Oh, you might not know what bacon is.  ""It's from adorable animals called pigs.  ""They're pink. We kill them,  ""take out their bacon, and eat it.  Um, we won't kill you though, uh ""  - Wh-Why don't I type? - No, no, no, I got it.  - Um, ""Greetings from Earth""? - Yeah.  - And then ""xoxo""? - Sure.  - TINA: And send. - (beeping)    I bet we get a message back in three,  two,  one.  Damn.  Tina, can I ask you something?  - Of course, partner. - So,  you know how sometimes you talk to boys and stuff?  - Big-time. - Well,  there's this boy I kind of like, but  Never mind, never-never mind.  Come on, do like this thing and dish, girl.  Well, the problem is,  he's kind of aloof.  Got it. Dangerous bad boy.  I can work with that. Have you made a move?  No, I don't think he's into me. Or anyone.  Look, I know it's scary to put yourself out there.  - It is. - But it's like jumping into a pool.  If you don't take the leap, then you're just the girl  in her bathing suit looking at a pool.  - (chime, beeping) - Whoa, it's the aliens!  Hang on. It's probably just interference.  Wait, that's Morse code.  What does that mean?  We made contact, Tina.  Holy crap! What does the message say?  I don't know. We have to wait for the pattern to start over.  This is incredible.  We made contact.  I'm your alien now, Tina.  All right, we did it. Now pay up.  Yeah! Where's our frozen yogurt gift card?!  I've got your gift card right here.  - (gasps) - Gimme, gimme, gimme! - Not so fast.  You'll get it when the job's done.  But may I recommend no toppings?  That's how they get you.  Yeah, it really weighs down your cup.  I use Rice Krispies.  It adds crunch and it weighs nothing.  Amateur, amateur, amateur!  Speaking of heaping too much on top,  I'm regretting that I let you write the message  from the aliens.  TINA: ""Dear, idiots of Earth!  ""You should not be transmitting!  ""We have a protocol to destroy  ""any and all life we discover!  ""You're lucky I got this message and not my boss!  ""He's a real pain in the glorg!  ""Anyway, I have to tell him about this.  ""Maybe he won't want to destroy your planet!  ""I'll let you know tomorrow! In the meantime,  do not transmit any more signals!""  - Holy crap, Susmita! - Oh, my God!  Our Science Fair project might have just destroyed Earth!  - (gasping) - (whimpering)  What are they freaking out about? Oh, yeah.  - (gasping) - (whimpering)  The aliens might destroy Earth!  I know! This sucks.  What do we do? What do we do?  - Susmita. - Yeah?  This might be our last day on Earth.  If there's anything we want to do,  I guess we should go do it.  (panting) Move! Out of the way!  - Hey, Tina - (sweeping romantic music plays)  (moaning)  - (panting) - Whoa.  Ugh, why is your face so wet?  - (panting, shouts) - (shouts)  Dang, Tina! I must be a giant whoopee cushion,  'cause you just knocked a fart out of me!  Aw, screw it.  - Mm, mwah. - (grunting)  - Holy do-what-in-the-huh? - (panting)  (bells tinkle)  Hi, kids. How was your day?  (groans) I love you so much, Mom.  I love you, too, sweetie.  Dad, have you told Mom how much you love her today?  Um, I-I think maybe?  - Tell her, damn it! - I-I love you, Lin.  - Wait, what's happening? - Everything's fine.  Life is just so damn beautiful.  - Thank you. - I freakin' love you, Gene.  - I, uh, love - I love you, too, Louise.  Yep, yep, that's good.  Aw, my Teeny Tina's emotional.  What about this coat-rack? Is it beautiful?  No, it's weird. You shouldn't have bought it.  - He bought five. - (emotional): I know.  That was really dumb, Dad. But I love you.  You're dumb. I mean, I-I love you, too.  So, what did you do after school yesterday?  I did some, um, kissing.  Well, because of your advice,  I, uh, wrote a note to the boy I have a crush on.  Attagirl. Did he write back? What did he say?  I didn't give it to him.  Damn, Susmita. The world's maybe about to end,  and you're sitting on an unsent love note?  Funny advice considering how we got here,  Miss Greetings From Earth Please Come Kill Us.  - (beeping) - Oh, my God.  This is it. It's going through the translator.  TINA: ""Dear Earth idiots!  ""I was gonna tell my boss about your message.  ""But he was in what I guess you call 'the bathroom.'  ""Anyway, he took forever, and then my shift was over.  So, you guys got lucky. I didn't tell him.""  - He didn't tell him! - (gasps)  ""But if you ever send another message,  ""your planet will be destroyed.  So do not ever send another message!""  Oh, thank God.  Okay. Phew. Um, so should we write back and say thanks?  - Tina, no! - Right, right, right.  All right, this could work.  Why? Why is this gonna work?  People like sidewalk sales?  Hey, Bob! Hey, uh, what-what are you doing?  Something stupid, I'll bet! Zoom!  We're having a sidewalk mini coat-rack super sale.  Coat-racks? Why would anyone need coat-racks?  They're for putting coats on.  People need coat-racks, Jimmy!  That's dumb! You just hang your coat on the back of your chair.  You're dumb!  Oh, put a fettuccine in your in-betweeny, Jimmy!  Ah, criminy sliminy, I'm going inside.  It seems like we scared them straight.  Give us the damn gift card, Habes.  Thanks to your help, I think we broke your sister's spirits  and put a lid on her reckless sense of optimism for a while.  Here you go.  I feel really good about this.  Yeah, what does it matter what Tina thinks of us?  We're gonna be eating free frozen yogurt!  I feel terrible.  Yeah  That sneaky alien faker son of a bitch!  And you guys, too! I-I can't believe you helped him! Ugh!  I know! We're sorry!  And that's why we bought you this gift card.  - With our own money. - Thank you.  - It's a good start. - Yeah.  Wait, Susmita, you know what this means?  Now we can do our science project.  - Like, really do it. - What do you mean?  We can fix our satellite and resend our message  - to actual aliens. - I don't know, Tina.  What? What do you mean you don't know?  I mean, I'm mad at Henry,  and he shouldn't have messed with our project.  But maybe he's right. It's too risky  - to send out a message. - Of course you'd say that.  You couldn't even give a love note to a boy  when you thought it was your last day on Earth.  Ugh! I never should have told you that.  Have you even started working on our Science Fair board yet?  - Don't change the subject. - The Science Fair is today!  That's literally the subject!  Look, I need to go type up our conclusion.  We don't have a conclusion.  Our conclusion is that there is no logical reason  to attempt to make contact with extraterrestrials.  Damn it, Susmita! You sound just like Henry!  Well, at least we can still get an ""A,"" Tina.  Screw the ""A""!  - (gasping) - Yeah, you know what?  I don't think we should be Science Fair partners anymore.  Well, I'm still turning in the radio telescope project.  What are you turning in?  Uh, how 'bout a little project called  ""Peanut Butter: What's Up with That?""  I still have time. Kind of.  We'll help you, T.  Well, good luck with your peanut butter!  Good luck with your  never taking chances in life!  See you at the Science Fair!  Oh, I-it's in the, uh, auditorium, right?  - Yeah. - That's what I thought.  TINA:  up with that?  Okay, Hildy in the cafeteria didn't have any peanuts,  but she let us take a few handfuls of almonds.  Not all of mine made it back.  Thanks. I guess almonds will have to do.  Okay, we have two hours until the Science Fair.  It's time to see if you can make peanut butter  - without using any butter. - Or peanuts.  (sighs) It's starting to rain a little.  I'm shutting down the super sidewalk  mini coat-rack full-price sale.  How many did you sell?  Lin, you know I didn't sell any.  Hey, look at these little coat-racks.  - Aren't these fun? - This one looks like a little tree.  That's funny. Trees are funny.  Um, do-do you want to buy it?  - Why would I buy it? - (laughing)  I'm just gonna put my coat on it, right?  Aw, people are using 'em.  Because people need coat-racks.  This is what I've been saying!  Hey, wait, those people with coats  are going into Jimmy Pesto's.  Hey! He doesn't have coat-racks!  Pesto's doesn't have coat-racks!  He-he wants you to put your wet coats on the back of your chair!  What? What? No, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! That's not true!  - Yes, it is! Come over here to Bob's Burgers! - It's no No!  - We have coat-racks! - No! No!  - No! (groaning) - Yes! Yes!  We win! Sort of.  Oh, Bobby! Mwah, mwah!  Now lift me up like in The Notebook!  (grunts)  (strained): I can't.  SUSMITA: And that's why we shouldn't attempt to make contact  with extraterrestrials.  That's exactly right.  (panting)  Oh. Hi, Tina.  Uh, so I guess you and Susmita aren't partners anymore?  We, uh, had some scientific disagreements.  - Well, you're up. - (exhales) So,  I started with some almonds.  Your board says ""peanuts.""  Which are harder to find than you may think.  Um, so, after crushing these almonds,  they were transformed into a powder.  - (quietly): She's nailing this. - Really strong start.  Um, and, honestly, I wish I was still doing my other project,  but we came to two different conclusions.  She thought it was logical to never reach out to aliens,  but I think it's only logical  that we need to reach out to them.  - Wrong. - Shh!  And why is that, Tina?  Well, if we never reach out  Uh, j-just look at all these other projects!  I mean, first off, amazing boards.  Great job, everybody. Seems like a lot of parents got involved,  but no judgment. But look at look at Zeke  and Tammy's board. The bees are dying.  Preach, girl!  Sea levels are rising.  She's talking about our board.  No, Jocelyn.  - We did the life of the sun. - Oh.  Right. But what happens when the sun burns out?  Spray tan, I guess?  A-And, uh, look at this one. Overpopulation.  We're burning through natural resources like crazy.  Wow, the Science Fair is a real downer this year.  So, yeah, if-if we make contact with aliens, they might kill us.  But what if we reach out and the aliens help us?  They could act in alien movies. That'd be cool.  The thing you're afraid of could be our only chance at survival.  In conclusion, if we open ourselves up,  yes, we might get hurt.  But if we don't open ourselves up,  we die alone.  Oh, my God.  Did she just change my mind?  Good job, partner.  Now, I've got to go make contact  with a boy I have a crush on.  - The one you wrote that note to? - Yeah.  Get it, girl.  - Henry? - Uh, yes, Susmita?  I've got a message for you.  Doo-doo. Doo. Doo-doo. Doo. Doo-doo-doo. Doo. Doo.  Oh, wow. Okay.  I mean, 100%.  Doo. Doo-doo-doo. Doo. Doo. Doo-doo  I ho I hope the aliens destroy Earth right now.  It was Henry? You got to be beeping kidding me.  Hey, Tina! I can't wait till the next last day on Earth!  I'm excited for that apocalypse!  You know what I'm sayin'. The apoca-lips.  Zeke, what-what are you talking about?  What? Uh, nothing. Uh, come on.  Come on, I'm gonna get ya. (grunts) Come on, come on.  Ow, Zeke. Ow.  - Come on, come on. - Aah, Zeke!  Doo-doot doo-doot doo means I love you   No. No, it doesn't.  Doot doo-doo-doot doo-doo-doot means I care   That actually means ""egg.""  Doo-doot doo-doot-doot doo-doo   - Means, um, ""oranges""? - That means ""cat.""  Doo-doot doo-doo-doot doo-doo means I'll always be there   That's just ""cat"" again.  Doo-doot-doot doot-doot doo   Doo-doot doo-doot doot-doo-doo   Doo-doot doo-doot doot doo doo     BOTH:  Doo-doot doo-doot doo-doo   TINA:  Means I love you"
"1  OLSEN BENNER: Wonder Wharf feels more like Winter Wharf  after a record-breaking snowstorm overnight.  Someone tell Santa to put on his snow tires.  Ha! Snow tires.  With schools on winter break this week,  it's a nice day for a white sledding.  You are correct, Olsen Benner from Channel 6 News.  We're gonna sled ourselves sick.  Sledding's my favorite sport because Lady Gravity  does all the work.  I've been practicing my ""whee!""  Whoo! Oh, wait.  Snowplows have been working  since early this morning to clear the streets  and bury my Subaru.  Hey, that's my truck. Wow!  It looks ten pounds heavier on TV.  Oh, yeah, look at you plowing.  - Where are you? - Church parking lot.  I got to call my mom. This counts as going, right?  Whoa, Teddy, you're really fishtailing a lot.  Yeah, I am. It's snowy, Bob.  Do you even know how to plow, Bob?  You just drive drive a car  and push the snow off to the side, right?  Yes. Something like that.  All right, team, let's chop-chop with the hot-choc.  - Sleds await. - Hang on.  (straining)  There's a marshmallow down there I cannot reach.  - That's life, pal. - LINDA: Have fun, kids.  If you see Rudolph, don't make fun of him.  He doesn't like that.  LOUISE: So, the plan is we sled, and then we sled some more,  and then we keep sledding. Sound good?  Huh, I see sleds, but I don't see butts in them.  Rudy, Darryl, why aren't you guys sledding?  We've got a little situation.  Oh, just go behind a tree and use some leaves.  And don't be creeped out by that one squirrel that likes to watch.  N-No, I'm talking about that.  (all grunting)  - LOGAN: Hey! Ow! - LOUISE: Ugh. Logan.  Here's a snowball in your spleen.  - (grunts) - (groans)  - And a snowball in your ween. (grunts) - Ow!  GENE: Aah! I don't want to get snowballs  in any of those places.  Yeah, I'm a snowball magnet.  Maybe we should sled somewhere that doesn't have  rowdy teen boys with arms.  Well, now, hold on. We don't want to go somewhere  with no hot, rowdy teen boys.  - Nobody said hot. - Someone did.  Guys, this is the only hill in the park.  This is where we sled.  We can't let Logan and his stupid friends  snowball on our parade.  - Come on, let's go. - Okay.  Ah.  (cries out, grunts)  (all groaning)  (grunting and groaning continue)  Okay, that was perfect, but let's run away.  (kids continue groaning)  Saving Private Ryan called.  It wants its opening scene back.  You're not gonna believe what I found in the basement.  A tote bag? You just found that?  Look at the handles on that thing.  No, I mean what's inside the bag.  Ta-da! It's my knitting yarn.  - Wait, you knit? - Yeah, I knit.  Are you sure? Because I've never seen you do it before.  Well, I was gonna knit.  I bought this yarn when I was pregnant with Louise.  I wanted to make the kids scarves,  and I never got around to it.  But now it's time. It's time to knit or get off the pot.  (chuckles) I'm gonna make the kids scarves for Christmas.  Are you gonna be able to do that, Lin?  - Christmas is in two days. - Oh, yeah, scarves are a cinch.  You just You whip 'em right up.  So, what are you gonna do with this terrific tote  - that nobody wants? - Hey, get your hands off that.  - It's my knitting bag. - Hey, can can you  - I just want to look at it. - Ooh, get off it. Teddy, stop!  Bob, Bob, who should have the tote?  And don't say split it in half.  I-I don't want to get involved.  But Teddy, he needs it more.  - Ah, yeah, maybe you're right. - Yes!  That was horrible.  How could something as pure as snow  be so violently thrown at us?  This is ridiculous.  I'm gonna go talk some sense into these fools.  Okay, you do that, and we'll support you  by standing right here at this safe distance.  Oh, great, it's Louise Smellcher.  Oh, clever, Logan.  Look, I know your tiny little brain  doesn't understand things, so let me help you out here.  This is a sledding hill, where people sled  every time it snows.  Actually, this is the snowball-fighting hill now,  because sledding is for babies, and babies should be home  sleeping or doing tummy time.  But this is the only hill in the park.  There's nowhere else to sled.  Oh, maybe you should try checking out the hill  by the I don't give a crap. (laughs)  Well, your face gives a crap,  because your face is crap, Logan.  - Your face is crap. - Your face is crap!  - Your face is a crap! - You're the crappest face!  Logan, are we snowballing or what?  Yeah, we're snowballing!  Scram, sled wetters.  Son of a (shouts)  - (laughs): Oh, man. - Ow! What the ?  - Uh-oh. - Oh, no.  You'd better dash, diaper rash.  - Got to go. - Logan, let's just enjoy the day.  - Enjoy that! - Oh!  Okay, we need a new plan.  Who can throw a snowball really hard?  - Uh, nah. - Not so much.  I could give it a try. (grunts)  Where'd it go?  Hey, my cousin Mandy is a pitcher  on the high school softball team.  She lives near here. Maybe she could help.  Is she good?  She makes underhand look like overhand.  - Understand? - No.  You know what? That was confusing. I'll call her.  TINA: Lot of testosterone down there.  And we've all synced our cycles up here.  Wow.  GENE: Rudy's cousin is Brienne of Tarth.  So, yeah. This is Mandy.  Yeah, hi. I'm Mandy.  Rudy cried until I said I'd come.  That's how I got you to come to my yellow belt test at the dojo.  Would've been so cool if I had passed.  Is that Logan?  - LOUISE: You know him? - Yeah. He's in my grade.  He used to pick on me when I was younger.  He called me Manitary Napkin.  He picked on you? You're so much bigger than him.  Well, I used to be smaller.  Hey, maybe I'll be really big and strong  when I'm older, right, cuz?  Yeah. Sure, buddy. High-five.  - High-five Oh, ow! - Oof, sorry.  Look, I'm only gonna give you guys about 15 pitches.  Let me see if I can even throw snow.  Might be wasting your time.  - (grunts) - Ooh!  - Is he dead? - Uh  No, he's moving. Twitching is moving, right?  LOUISE: Yes. Santa, look away.  This isn't for your delicate eyes.  OK everybody, here's the plan.  we protect Mandy as she rains down frozen terror,  and we take back the land that is rightfully ours.  We might not all make it  Why are you looking at me?  Shh. But those that do will remember the fallen.  - I feel like I'm gonna throw up. - That's my little warrior.  (grunting)  Oh, good. I was wondering where I was gonna put all this snow.  Now I know. In your tiny, dumb face.  - Shields up! - Uh, okay.  LOUISE: It's time for a pitch slap!  Manitary Napkin? What are you doing here?  - (grunts) - Oh! My neck!  (grunting)  LOUISE: Advance!  (grunting and groaning)  Advance!  (grunting and groaning)  Advance!  (grunting and groaning)  - I'm out of here. - Me, too.  - Come on, Logan. - No way.  - I'm not going anywhere. - (Mandy grunts)  (strained): Okay, maybe I am.  (cheering)  Yes! Nice work, Manitary Napkin.  Thanks. Wait, don't call me that.  Right, right, right, right, right, right, right right.  - Lin, can you take these to table two? - LINDA: Bob, I can't.  I'm knitting, and I got to keep going.  Wait, that's all you've done?  Yes, Bob. It's slow at first,  but then it's like Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba, scarf.  Now stop distracting me.  Okay, I'll just cook and serve the food  and do everything and you're not listening.  (humming The Nutcracker Suite)  BOB: Lin.  (continues humming)  Oh, my beautiful scarves.  Great job, Linda.  Thank you, Knitcracker.  - (humming) - BOB: Lin, you're scaring me.  - Wha ? - Who's Knit-cracker?  Nobody. Oh, no, I dropped a stitch.  - Oops, another one. Oops, another one. - Sorry, did I throw you off?  I just thought maybe you were going crazy.  Hush, Bob! Oh, God, another one.  Ooh, there goes another one.  Hey, Mandy, the dumb teen boys are gone.  You can go. I'm sure you've got, mm, athletic stuff to do.  I always have athletic stuff to do, but I'm just sticking around  because Rudy wanted me to watch him sled.  Look at me! Backwards!  Tell the other cousins about this. Oh!  Oh, my God, too scary. Turning around, turning around.  Whee! I feel like a kid again.  I feel like I'm in one of those breath mint commercials.  Is that a giant white round bird?  - (both scream) - It's not!  What the hell?  RUDY: The teenage boys are back.  And they brought their young-looking dad.  Everyone, I'd like you to meet Cameron.  He's on the varsity basketball team.  He's their best outside shooter.  Hey, you, uh you shoot a lot of threes, Cameron?  Yeah. Threes and twos and occasionally ones.  Yeah, that's right. All the numbers.  Oh, no. Everyone into formation, quick!  Don't worry, I got this.  - (grunts) - Oh!  Oh, snow down my back! Snow down my back!  - (grunts) - Oh, oh!  Down my crack. That's it, I'm done.  No! Where are you going?  MANDY: Sorry, guys. Oh, I feel it with every step.  Uh, I'm gonna go, too.  Too much snow time for me.  Uh, Louise, based on how far  my wiener has retracted into my body, we should go, too.  Ugh! Fine, we're leaving.  But we're walking away with dignity.  - (grunts) - Aah! Forget dignity!  Just go! Go, go, go, go!  Hey, Teddy. Back so soon?  What? I just plowed two parking lots.  That means I get two cups of coffee. That's my system.  I'm gonna have 18 cups of coffee today.  - Mm. - How's the scarf, Linda?  It's great. Great. Everything's going perfectly. I'm right on track.  Lin, I-I'm worried you're not gonna get  three scarves done by Christmas.  I mean, you've only done about a inch and a half,  and it's been, like, three hours.  Thanks for the pep talk, Bob.  Yeah. Who invited Dr. Scrooge?  - Scrooge was not a doctor. - Not a medical doctor, right.  Listen, Lin, maybe I can help.  What do you mean? Like, knit?  Yeah. You can show me how, right?  All right. Here, watch me.  You put the thing through the thing, and you pull it through like this  - Mm-hmm. - Yay, it worked.  - Nice one, Linda. - Here, Bob. You try.  Now, don't rush. You take your time.  - Okay. - It unravels so easily.  You got to be real careful Oh, you did it.  - Yeah. - You did it again.  Yeah. It-it's easier than I thought.  Okay, all right, calm down. Give it.  Oh, they're back.  (whispers) Hide the yarn. Don't let them see it.  How was sledding, kids?  - (blows raspberry) - (groans)  Logan and his friends took over the sledding hill  and threw basketball-sized snowballs at us.  Ugh. Snow bullies. When I was little,  this kid Ricky used to follow me around  and throw snowballs at me every time it snowed.  And I'd try to laugh it off.  (laughs) ""Very funny, Ricky. I love it.""  But I hated it, you know? I-I hated him.  I used to fantasize about sneaking up on him  when he was volunteering  and just nailing him with a snowball.  And all the homeless people just laugh at him.  Wait, your childhood bully was a volunteer at a homeless shelter?  Yeah, he was an Eagle Scout.  - (growls) - LINDA: Darn those mean boys  for ruining my babies' fun.  We could still have fun.  Maybe we could build a snowman out front.  Oh, yeah. We could use dog-pee snow to give him blond hair  and a gold chain and a pee stain on his pants.  I don't want to build a dog-pee snowman.  I want to sled.  This is our winter break, damn it.  But there's nothing we can do.  Logan and his friends have the hill.  I know that, Tina.  Whelp, got to get back out there.  The extra-wide men's shoe store parking lot  is not gonna plow itself.  And you know what? Narrow lot.  - See you, Teddy. - (door opens, closes)  LOUISE: Guys, I changed my mind.  Let's build that snowman.  - Teddy. - Yeah?  I was just thinking about your snow bully, Ricky.  Eh, yeah, Ricky.  Yeah. I bet you wish you could get him back somehow, huh?  You mean like get a job as his doctor  and then tell him he's gonna die in a month?  Yeah, that could work,  or you could help us get back at our snow bullies.  What? How?  Logan and his jerk friends couldn't throw  their dumb snowballs on the hill  if there was no snow for them to throw.  Like if someone plowed it all away?  Oh, wow. Yeah. Who would do that?  You would, Teddy.  Oh, no. I only do driveways and parking lots.  Oh, okay. I guess the snow bullies win again.  - Ricky would be proud. - (boy grunting)  YOUNG TEDDY: All right, all right, that's hilarious.  (laughs) All right, that's enough, Ricky!  (echoing): That's enough, Ricky!  Okay, I'll do it.  - You'll do it? - I'll do it.  Louise, if Teddy plows the hill, then we can't sled.  That is not what this is about, Tina.  If she can't be mine, then no one can have her.  You can't force someone to love you, Louise.  - Wait, what are we talking about? - The hill.  - We're plowing that son of a bitch! - Yeah, we are.  And we'll blame it all on global warming.  It's the perfect crime.  LINDA: Bedtime, kids.  Turn off the TV and jingle your butts to bed.  I'll, uh, go in a sec.  Come on, Teddy.  - (phone rings) - Is it done?  TEDDY: I can't. I-I can't do it.  I'm not supposed to be driving my plow in the park.  I'd get in big trouble.  Ugh. Teddy, listen.  You're not hurting anyone. You're helping.  And besides, no one's gonna know it was you.  - Who's calling this late? - Telemarketer selling makeup.  Ooh, what kind of makeup?  Oh, actually, it's insurance.  Oh, ew.  Teddy, you there?  Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.  Okay, I'm coming down there.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You stay where you are.  The-the-the park's no place for a kid.  I'll take care of this. You can do this, Teddy.  Just picture Ricky in his Eagle Scout uniform  raising money to build a hospital.  Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.  - (phone rings) - Hello? Is this the police?  (whispering): It's Louise. Is it done?  - Nothing happened. - You didn't do it?  I didn't say that.  Nothing happened because I was never here.  So did you do it or not do it, Teddy?  All I'm gonna say is the hill looks different  than it did 20 minutes ago.  I-I got to go, Louise. I got to get out of  this park that I was never in and I'm not in right now.  Yes.  Oh, look at your scarf.  It's so long and so straight.  - Yeah, I think it's almost finished. - Wow.  How-how's yours coming?  It's coming along.  Is it a little narrow?  No, it's not narrow.  It's like a tie. But that's good.  - It could be a tie. - It's supposed to be,  so it goes around a couple times.  Right, except for how short it is.  It's the style, Bob.  Well, I'm gonna go to sleep.  Uh, I could start a new scarf in the morning if you want.  Great. Good night.  (""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" plays)  (gasps) Oh.  Knit-cracker?  - You suck at this. - Aah!  You'll be knitting the same scarf until you die.  Oh, my God. (chokes)  Bobby!  - Lin, are you all right? - Oh! I had a dream. I  My scarf was wrapped around my neck and tried to kill me.  Well, it's not really long enough to wrap around your neck.  - Right? - Good night, Bob.  Good night.  (yawns)  Revenge. The best sleeping pill.  OLSEN (on TV): The town is getting a double dose of winter  after a second record-breaking snowfall early this morning.  What? It snowed? No, no, no, no, no, no, no!  - LINDA: Isn't it pretty? - LOUISE: No!  Well, I'm gonna go shovel the sidewalk.  Wow, Dad. That's, like, the butchest thing you've ever said.  - Thanks, Gene. - I'm gonna go work on the scar  I mean, work on something really special  that you're all gonna love.  I mean-I mean nothing. Stay out of my room!  (dishes clatter, Louise groans)  Stupid snow.  - Louise, are you our new kitchen? - This is armor.  I'm going back to the hill to sled, as is my God-given right.  What? No. Come on, is it worth it?  All this fighting just to sled? It's Christmas break.  It's the time of year for peace and goodwill, damn it.  This is the best snow this town has seen in years,  maybe even ever, and if I have to,  - I'll sled till I've bled. - Louise, wait.  No, Tina. You guys stay here where it's safe.  I'm going alone.  Oh. I was just gonna say  maybe you should take these oven mitts  - for extra butt padding. - Oh.  But now this is awkward, so I guess I'll go with you?  I mean, ""I'll go with you,"" I said strongly.  We both will. Right, Gene?  ""Right,"" I said, not totally knowing  what you guys are talking about.  Thanks, guys. It's a good day to die.  - What? -Huh? - Nothing, nothing.  Get your pots on.  We're all suited up.  We're pretty much invincible. Let's sled.  Uh, after you.  All right, here I go.  Oh. Oh, no.  (panting)  - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh.  We're sledding whether you guys throw snowballs at us or not.  Oh, we're gonna throw snowballs at you,  but these aren't just any old snowballs.  All the old snow from yesterday got plowed for some reason,  and now that snow is really hard and icy.  These snowballs leave a mark.  Show her, Caleb.  - How's that feel, buddy? - Hurts.  Yeah, that's right it hurts.  Throw your dumb, super snowballs.  That's what this is for.  You just rob a Williams Sonoma?  - What are you, my mom? - What?  She stole a muffin thing. Whatever.  - Just give me my sled back. - Uh-uh.  - Give it! Oh, no. - (laughs)  Looks like you're baking sheet out of luck.  - Get ready to eat snow Smellcher - Okay  Uh, whatever you do, don't aim for my butt.  She's trying to get us to aim for her butt, guys.  She's probably got oven mitts in there or something.  What? No. That's ridiculous.  Then why does it look like your butt could take a sheet  of fresh-baked cookies out of the oven?-b  - Genetics? - All right, gentlemen.  On three.  - One, two - Stop.  Hit us. Myself and Gene?  We were supposed to both use our armor to block Louise.  Sorry. Seemed like you had it covered. Here I come.  The more the merrier.  - One - (Belchers groaning)  - two - (grunts)  What the ?  - Mandy? - Manitary Napkin?  - Aah! It's the whole softball team. - Aah!  And the girls basketball team.  BOY: And the lacrosse team.  Get 'em, girls.  (shouting)  Rudy, did you do this?  Yeah. Me and my dad were driving to get some earrings  for his friend Nancy, even though they're not sure  where their relationship is going,  and I saw you guys walking to the park with your sleds.  I thought you were gonna get killed, so I called Mandy.  (grunts) I was at the gym with some of the girls,  and Sarah called her friend on the basketball team.  (grunts) And they were like, ""We can hit Logan with snowballs?""  And then we decided to call everyone we know  who also wanted to hit Logan with snowballs, and here we are.  (grunts)  - Ow! - Logan, this is too intense.  We're gonna take off.  That's right, run away with your fully formed teenage butts.  And don't even think about coming back.  No, this isn't over!  It'll be over in a few seconds.  You're about to get wiped out by a Manitary Napkin.  That's right, I'm owning it now.  - Uh (grunts) - Hey!  Human shield! Probably the worst, smallest choice for one,  but-but here we are.  - (bells jingle) - Hey, Teddy.  Another big snowplow day, huh?  Yeah. It's a Christmas miracle.  My prayers were answered.  I said, ""Lord, please don't let anyone find out  about the terrible thing I did last night.""  And then it snowed.  So it's like it never happened.  Wait, Teddy, what terrible thing did you do last night?  I, uh I didn't do anything.  What terrible thing did you do, Bob?  Okay. Hey, Lin, have you seen my scarves?  I haven't seen them. I'm sorry.  Huh. That's weird. Because they were right here a minute ago.  - Ah, I can't help you. - (gasps) Linda!  You threw them in the garbage?  No. I threw them in the recycling.  - Why did you do that? - (sighs) I'm sorry.  I-I feel like a failure, Bob.  I was gonna be a great knitter who made my children scarves.  And then I was gonna start a store on Etsy  and call it ""Scarving Children.""  But all I made was this weird-looking mess.  - Oof. - It's not that bad.  - Yes, it is. - Teddy.  Let's just give the kids your scarves.  No. B-Between my two and your one,  we have a scarf for each kid.  They can just share them, so no one gets one they don't want.  I guess.  And we could say your mom knitted them.  They can be a gift from Gram Gram.  You're gonna blame Gram Gram for that?  - We blame a lot of stuff on her. - We do?  Oh, I guess I just do. I mean, she's great.  (Logan whimpers)  - Let go of her. - She's not a shield.  She's the only sister I have.  - What? - Oh. Hi.  Oh, Logan, Logan, Logan, you are so screwed.  MANDY: Surround him.  Wha-What are you doing? Stop it!  - S-Stop surrounding me! - Pummel his ass!  You're gonna have so much snow in you,  you're going to poop ice.  (chanting): Poop Ice! Poop Ice! Poop Ice!  - Poop Ice! Poop Ice! - (whimpers) Oh, God.  I think this is happening, pal.  Just get out of here.  Time to cover my unmentionables.  Merry Christmas, punk.  Ready Aim  Ugh, stupid Christmas.  (grunts)  What the ?  (both shouting)  Whoa  You saved me.  Oh, I didn't save you.  I just kind of gave you a little head start.  - Get him! - Oh, no!  - (all shouting) - LOGAN: Oh, this is horrible!  Merry Christmas, Logan.  - Let's sled! - (cheering)  BOB: Hey. This one's from Gram Gram. It's for all three of you.  You don't have to open it if you don't want to.  - Mine! - Let me at it! - Give me!  Scarves?  You guys can choose which one you want.  Flip a coin or fight it out.  - Ooh. I want this one. - That's the one I want.  Well, it's mine. So neither of you get it.  Wait, you all want that one?  Yeah. It's creepy, but it tells a story.  The other two just look like Gram Gram bought them  - at a store. - A boring scarf store.  Um, I wouldn't say it was ""boring."" It's just a  (whispering): They love my scarf, Bob.  (whispering): Yeah, they do.  You know what this means?  I'm better at knitting than you  - I knew it. Stick to burgers. - Oh, my God.  I made it! I made that!  Snowballs and sledding and sledding and snowballs   And snowballs and sledding   And sledding and snowballs and snowballs and sledding   And sledding and snowballs and sledding   -  And snowballs and sledding  -  Sledding!   Santa, cover your delicate eyes   Mandy's arm is gonna save the day   Mom knit a scarf that looks like a sad tie   But it's nice in its own weird way   Snowballs and sledding and sledding and snowballs   And snowballs and sledding   And sledding and snowballs   And snowballs and sledding and sledding"
"1  (Teddy sniffing)  - You guys smell that? - I said, ""Excuse me.""  - No, you didn't. - Not that.  Something different. It's a familiar smell  but also somehow exotic.  Like going to a mall in a different town.  Oh, you're probably smelling my smelly mom.  - Hey! - She's been wearing ""essential oils.""  Oh, yeah, the rosemary oil.  She bought them from her new friend, Angie.  - Her hot new friend, Angie. - What? Mom's way hotter.  (scoffs) Hotter than Angie? Are you nuts?  I mean, thank you, but you're nuts.  Mm, new friend. That's nice. How'd you guys meet?  At the grocery store in the toilet paper aisle.  We bonded 'cause we buy the same brand.  And then what, she said, uh,  ""You know what goes good with toilet paper? Oils.""  Kinda, yeah. It's, like, a hobby or something.  She's bringing some more over for me to try today.  I can't wait. They're cheap and I love 'em.  - Like Dad. - BOB: Gene.  She's young and she's fun,  and I like saying, ""Hey, Ange!"" when I see her.  Oh, there she is! Hey, Ange!  - That is fun. - Eh. - Fun enough.  - No. - Hey, Linda.  - Linda smells great. I'm Teddy. - Easy, Teddy, easy.  Ange, that rosemary oil is amazing!  My digestion is better, and I'm crazy relaxed.  Right, kids? Right?  Yeah. She just poops and sleeps, Angie.  Oh, I knew you'd like it.  Here's that geranium oil  - I was telling you about. - Ooh. Yeah.  It's calming and relaxing like the rosemary,  but this one also gives you healthier hair and skin.  Not that you need to worry about that.  - Oh, you. Stop it. - I want to buy some.  - What else do you have in there? - Well, this is clary sage,  which is good for ovulation.  - I'll take it! - Oh. It's for ovulation.  Don't talk yourself out of a sale.  Okay. Hey, I'm having an essential oil party tonight.  Either of you want to swing by?  An oil party? What's that? What is that?  Oh, it's really low-key. We have hors d'oeuvres and wine  -and people checking out different oils. - Sounds great.  Oh! You had me at hors d'oeuvres, wine and oils.  Well, Teddy and I were supposed to help Mr. Huggins  - move a bed tonight. - Oh, right,  I was gonna stay home with the kids.  - Crap! That's tonight? - Yeah.  But it shouldn't take any time. I hope.  Because that's why I agreed to do it.  Well, it's from 6:00 to 8:00. Come if you can.  - Here's my address. - Oh, that's early. I can go.  3456th Street. Oh, what a fun address.  It really is.  Okay. See you later. Bye, guys.  - Bye, Ange! - Bye, Ange! We'll see ya later!  Take it easy.  She's amazing. Did I play it cool?  No. I could hear you breathing the whole time.  - Yeah - Like, heavily breathing.  LOUISE: So, looks like a fun night with the sibs.  No parents, no rules!  Yes rules. Tina's gonna babysit. Right, Tina?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Okay.  TINA: Hey, guys,  with Mom and Dad out of the house  I have a surprise for tonight.  - You're going to bed early? - Is it a meringue?  It's the jigsaw puzzle Grandma gave us for Christmas.  Ugh. A jigsaw puzzle of the Big Dipper?  - It's impossible! - She gave that to us,  like, three Christmases ago.  If it didn't happen then, it's not gonna happen now.  Well, I'll just get it started, and maybe you guys  will be jumping in before you know it.  Aha! These two pieces were already stuck together.  Off to a pretty good start here.  Hey, neighbor! Thanks for helping me do this.  Uh, h-happy to help, Mr. Huggins.  - Hi, Bob. - Hey, Teddy.  The place we're picking up the bed  is a little further away than I thought.  - I hope that's okay. - No problem.  - It's fine. - Sorry I won't be much help.  Uh, can't lift anything since my back went out.  Well, uh, I guess that works for us.  Especially because it's an adjustable bed.  Those things are heavy.  - Yeah. - My old one weighed a ton.  It looked like a dentist chair crossed with a Transformer.  Oh. Do you need us to haul the old one away?  - Mm. Mm. - Bob, why are you hitting me?  - Don't. Will you stop? - Mmmm. Mm-mm.  - Your foot is getting away from you. - Mm. Yep.  No, I donated it. The charity people came and got it.  - Really cussed me out. - I hate those guys.  Linda! Come on in!  So glad you made it.  Oh, I'm so excited, I'm gonna oil myself.  - Heh. Get it? - Sort of.  This is Gary, Jill, Susan and Kim.  Some oil sellers. All oil users.  Hi! I'm Linda!  - Hi. - Welcome. -Hi.  ANGIE: And that's Reggie.  Reggie? Are you taking a break  from the deli to learn about oils?  Yep. No more stinkin' like salami for me.  Eh, I'm still getting a whiff. But it's good.  Also, I haven't been sick once since I started using essential oils.  - Wow! - And my toilet time?  Let's just say it's uneventful.  And I'm so healthy, I don't even have to wash my hands. Ever.  O Kay.  Look at all those oils, Angie!  I thought you were just selling them part-time,  but you've got more oil than a Beverly Hillbilly.  Oh, no. This is my full-time job.  - Oh. - But honestly, they sell themselves.  And maybe you can sell them, too.  Oh!  I found another corner-piece.  Wait, five corner-pieces?  You're fighting the good fight, T.  You're that puzzle's RenÃ©e Zellweger  from Jerry Maguire You complete it.  (phone rings)  Hello. I'm a kid,  but all my grown-ups are totally home.  Hi, Louise. It's your Aunt Gayle.  Can I talk to your mom? I lost the lottery again.  Yeah, I lied. Mom and Dad are both out.  They just like me to answer that way.  - Sounds natural. - Oh, that's nice.  Did they go to the movies?  Or go share one milkshake with two straws?  Is that what people do?  Tina! Aunt Gayle wants to talk to you!  - Hey, Aunt G. What's up? - I was calling for your mom,  but I guess she's out with your dad doing married stuff.  Actually, Dad's helping move a bed,  - and Mom's at an essential oil party. - (shuddering gasp) What?!  - Your mom's at an essential oil party?! - Yes.  (screaming)  Oh! We got to get your mom out of here!  - She needs an oil-vention! - Aunt Gayle, you're scaring me.  Yeah. You know I love being screamed at and thrown in a car,  but what is going on?  Essential oil parties are dangerous.  I bought the distributor's package at one of those parties,  $600 worth, and I couldn't sell any of it,  and I used half of it on myself!  - Oh, my God! - Bicyclist!  It's on my credit card, Tina.  - I'll be paying it off till I'm dead! - Aah!  We can't let your mom end up like me!  Aah! You're right!  We can't get any poorer, can we?  I guess she could sell all of our belongings and our clothes,  make us wear burlap sacks.  Aah! Burlap sacks are the itchiest sacks.  - We'll get her out of there. - Hot dog stand!  - Where? - I'm just saying we should stop at one!  GAYLE: Okay, let's go over the plan one more time.  We go into the party, you take Mom aside,  tell her the very sad story about what happened  - with you and the oils, and we get out. - Mm-hmm.  Bing bang boom. Angie will not know what hit her.  We have to get your mom home before they bring out  the big guns The credit card swipers.  - Can do! - And stay by my side at all times.  I can't be trusted with the p the p  the peppermint oil.  Oh, God, just saying the name gives me the shivers.  - Peppermint oil. - (shivering): Oh !   and that's when I got my ""aroma diploma.""  (laughter)  Oh, I'm not sure why you're all laughing.  Ugh. It smells like someone ate, prayed and loved  -too much in here. - GAYLE: Oh, no.  - It's worse than I thought. - TINA: Why?  GAYLE: She's pretty.  GENE: Thank you.  No, the host. Pretty friends  are your mom's a-chillies heel.  - Do you mean ""Achilles""? - No, ""a-chillies,""  like the heel.  She falls under the spell of these pretty people,  and she doesn't even realize they're using her.  Like her cheerleader friend Monica in high school.  - Mom's a pretty pleaser. - LINDA: Kids!  Gayle! What are you doing here?  Mom, Aunt Gayle has something to tell you.  (whispers): We got to get you out of here.  Stop it, Gayle. You're acting weird.  I'll make a distraction. You sneak out.  (deep voice): Pizza delivery!  (whispers): Gayle, either zip it or leave.  - But, Linda - ANGIE: Oh, hi.  Sorry, Angie. I didn't know  these guys were gonna show up.

Fun!  -(whispers): Linda. - Yeah, uh, yeah, kids,  go play in the kids' room. Stop it, Gayle.  Gayle, finish the job.  Do you guys like doing puzzles?  - Yes. - LOUISE and GENE: No!  I think this is it.  BOB: That's not too bad.  HUGGINS: Nah. Keep going.  I think this is it.  BOB: Oh my God.  BOB (grunting): This is just so awkward.  Have you never moved a mattress before?  I-I don't remember.  I think everywhere I lived  they were just there already.  Don't worry, the frame will be a lot easier.  It weighs about eight times as much as the mattress,  - but it's not as bendy. - BOB: Oh, God.  I think I've asked too much of people  I don't know all that well.  -(grunts): Well, maybe. - No, it's fine.  So let's fix that. What's your favorite movie?  - Or your favorite childhood memory? - What?  Let's, uh, let's get to know each other better.  Uh, maybe let's, uh, wait until we finish.  For me, it's Dark Crystal  - and the time my dad high-fived me. - Well, that's nice.  And oils don't just make you smell great,  they make you feel great.  - Oh, I love oils! - Speaking of oils  - (whining, barking) - Oh, look!  Uh-oh. Someone's up from his nap.  No, no, Ringo. No. Ringo, no jumping. Ringo.  - Oh, it's okay. - It's a puppy. - So adorable.  Oh, I love his name.  I called him Ringo, because he had ringworm.  Oh. Get down. Get down.  And because he pways the dwums.  Ah-ha-ha-ha! Drums!  Like Ringo McCartney.  TINA: This English cottage is coming together.  You bet your ass.  This is taking too long.  What's Aunt Gayle doing out there?!  She must have started a silent conga line,  since I don't hear any conga line music.  You know what? I'm gonna go out there and just tell Mom myself.  - Aunt Gayle had her chance - Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt,  but do you mind if we put Ringo in here?  - Oh, my God, what's happening? - Ringo!  Don't! Stop! Him!  Are you saying, ""Don't stop him""?  Or ""Don't. Stop him""?  I'm saying get away! Get away from us!  I mean, we're fine with him in here.  Okay, good. I'll leave you guys to play.  Who's the best boy in the world? Who's the softest boy?  (singsongy): My ears are burning.  TEDDY: Are you sure you're even lifting, Bob?  (straining): Yes. I am trying.  It's really heavy,  and I am so weak.  (both grunting)  What about your favorite foods?  I'll start this one. Thai food. No. Mexican.  Wait. Thai. You know what?  I think it's a tie. A Mexican-Thai tie.  - Hey, I need another break. - No. I have to hold this thing  every time we take a break.  It's not a break for me, Bob.  I'm just gonna push. Whatever happens, happens.  -(yells) - Wait, wait, wait, wait!  I already started! I can't stop now!  I'm pinned against the door! Pull it back!  I can't. It's stuck.  (groans) I'm gonna try to open the door.  Aah! It's locked!  Oh, you know what? I probably should've gone  ahead of you guys, because I have a key. Here you go!  - Ow! - Oh, did I get you?  J-Just my head and my face.  You need to get out of here, Linda.  Gayle, I said knock it off!  How are things goin' over here?  So far, so great!  But, um we're gonna leave.  - What? No! - Yeah, we should.  The kids are probably bored stiff in there.  (laughing): Right?  LOUISE: Now you're Smush face, now you're smooth face.  Now you're Smush face, now you're smooth face.  - Now you're Smush face - I feel like there's something else  - we're supposed to be doing right now. -  now you're smooth face.  Well, I'm up to my butt in puzzle, so  Almost done here. Just gonna do this one hundred more times.  Yeah, I should probably make his back skin into a purse again.  Yeah.  And we're finally done.  Wow, this thing's amazing.  I'm so grateful to you fellas.  I don't have any beer, but you want a tomato juice?  Oh, no thanks, Mr. Huggins.  - Uh, I'm-I'm gonna get going. - It's just,  n-now that I got this bed in here, I'm kind of freakin' out!  The reason I got this new bed is I'm starting to date again  Wow. You don't have to brag.  (chuckles) Eh.  No, it's not that.  It's just I'm a little scared.  I haven't been with anyone for 20 years.  Oh.  Now my new lady friend is coming over tonight,  I'm afraid I've been out of the game too long.  - Can I ask you two some questions? - Mm-hmm. Oh, God.  You came to the right guys, Mr. Huggins.  First of all, are silk bathrobes still sexy?  - I'm thinking yes, but let's see it. - Oh, boy.  (whispering): Linda, here's the thing.  You're in so much terrible danger.  Gayle, stop whispering in my ear!  - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! -(muffled) Mm, mm  I'm gonna let go of your lips, and then you can calmly say  - what it is you want to say. - (muffled): Mm.  Oils will ruin your life.  ANGIE: Who here is familiar with the peppermint oil?  Smell that.  Nng, nng, nng, nng, nng, nng, nng, nng. Ah.  And we're finished except for the several missing pieces.  I mean, how hard is it  to keep all your puzzle pieces in the box, right?  You're my baby, I'm your mommy. You're my baby, I'm your mommy.  Oh, crap. Mom! We forgot about Mom!  Damn it, Tina and your stupid English cottage!  - Easy there, puppy-hag. - Puzzle-putz.  Ladies, please! You both really messed up tonight.  This thing is great. I just plug it into my phone,  and you can pay with your credit card!  - Oh crap! - The swiper!  God, e-commerce has come so far. What? You were thinking it.  - Oh, yes! - We waited too long.  (sighs) Yeah. Aunt Gayle is no good to us now.  It's up to us to get Mom out of here.  There's no time to lose. She's gonna swipe any second.  - Front to back, I hope. - ANGIE: Oh, hey, kids.  What are you doing out here?  Oh. Hey.  Uh, poor Ringo threw up all over the place.  Uh, right, guys?  - Ah, yeah, so much. - It's ugly.  Oh, no. Sorry.  We're trying a new puppy food. It's made from wasps.  Are you just saying that so I won't want to try it?  - Ah! (sniffs) - Mom, we got to get out of here.  Why does everyone keep saying that?  You're falling under Angie's spell,  like you fell under Monica's spell in high school!  What? No, this is nothing like Monica.  Monica used to make me hold her cigarette  whenever a teacher would walk by.  Angie's nice. She likes nice smells.  Has she asked you to start selling the oil?  Well, yeah, because she thinks I can.  - I didn't see any throw-up in there. - Maybe Ronnie cleaned it up?  - Or Ringo ate it? - Or Ronnie ate it.  In any case, we, uh all have to get going.  - No! We're not going yet. -(Gayle sniffing)  You guys go back to the kids' room until we're done in here.  - But - No buts!  - But, uh - I'll tell you what.  Go back in, and I'll put this diffuser in there with you.  - Kids love diffusers. Right? - It's all we ever talk about.  (muttering): Va-Va-Va-Va, Va-Va-Va-Va.  Ugh!  So what do you think?  Anything look weird to you guys?  - Like, weird how? - Mm.  You know what I mean. Do I look okay?  Yeah, you look you look great.  Uh, so should we go?  Uh, turn around, Mr. Huggins. Let's get a look at the back.  - Wow. - (gasps)  What? What? My tattoo?  There's a tattoo under there?  LOUISE: Throw us back in here with the adorable  Ringo to distract me?  It's not gonna work, Angie!  -(barking) - Not now, my sweet boy.  On a positive note, over here in puzzle-town,  I have drawn replacement pieces  with these markers and sticky notes,  (sing-songy): and we're about to move into an English cottage.  Ronnie, you son of a bitch, if I was just five years younger.  Oh I don't get it.  Wait. Markers.  Yeah. They're like pens, but  Well, just try one and see.  -(buzzing) - My side's going pretty well.  How are you doing over there, Bobby?  I'm getting a lot of hair in my mouth right now, so, uh  Ha. Ha, ha, ha.  Let-let let's wrap it up. Ugh.  Just swallow it. It won't hurt you.  Hey, what are you guys talking about back there?  Nothing. Oh, there's the tattoo. Found it.  - What is that? - It's a yin-yang.  Who told you this was a yin-yang?  The guy at the place! Is it that bad?  Uh, I'll just shave some and leave some.  -(buzzing) - Then, it kind of works.  -(buzzing stops) - Oh, wait. No, it doesn't.  Eh, it doesn't. Uh, do you have any high boxers?  Uh, sorry to interrupt again.  - Louise doesn't look so good. - I feel okay.  I'm just a little wheezy and a little itchy.  Maybe too much oil in the air?  I'm so sorry.  I've heard an allergic reaction is possible,  but I've never seen it.  Guess I'm lucky, Angie.  Hmm. Come here. Give me that.  - Uh-oh. - Is that marker?  - You kids are in big trouble! - Come on!  - We're trying to help you! - Mom, you got to listen to us!  No! No, no, no! Don't start.  I'm gonna finish talking about the deluxe distributor package  with Angie, and you're gonna leave with your Aunt Gayle.  Deluxe distributor package? No!  Gayle, take the kids home, and give those vials back to Reggie.  - Ah - Keep 'em.  Mom, we don't want what happened to Aunt Gayle to happen to you.  - What are you talking about? - Gayle? Ugh.  -(groans) - Gayle!  - Huh? - Tell her!  Oh. Right. Linda, I tried selling oil.  I tried it. I got in over my head!  I bought the distributor package.  I couldn't sell any of it.  It's on my credit card for the rest of my life!  Gayle, none of that surprises me, okay?  But that's not gonna happen to me.  All of you, go home now.  (kids groaning)  - Let us love you! - Aah! Aah!  If you come back in here, you're grounded.  You too, Gayle. Good-bye.  - (quietly): What do we do now? - I don't know.  Take a bat to the window? Tina, pass me your bat.  - I didn't bring a bat. - Damn it, Tina.  Is anyone else having trouble like that?  Um, uh, my sales are  They're-they're pretty terrific.  I've been selling a lot, to my family, mostly.  Uh, they're very supportive.  Mine, too, but the best news is I-I may have found a new lender.  So I can buy more oils to pay for the ones I used on myself.  I'm looking forward to selling my first vial.  And sure, a-a friend of mine stopped talking to me,  'cause of the oils, but I really thought  he could use some diffusers to deal with his sinuses.  He-he has bad sinuses. Eucalyptus, right?  - Right! - I'm not crazy. He's crazy!  Huh.  Nah, but maybe-maybe more to the left.  - Okay. Okay. - There you go. Nailed it.  - Okay, how about that? - No, that's perfect.  - That's perfect. - Okay. Okay, so that lamp's on?  - Yup. - And that lamp off.  All right. Yeah. Both of 'em not on. Try that.  - That's pretty dark. - Oh, now it's dark. Right. Yeah.  - This is stupid. - Okay. okay, yeah.  - Uh that's better. - Of course it's better!  What is wrong with you guys?! When is this gonna end?!  Sorry. That was unnecessary.  It's just been a very annoying  and physically painful evening.  I've taken up enough of your time.  It'll be fine. It'll go how it goes.  (sighs) Uh, Mr. Huggins, listen.  You're-you're a great guy, I-I think.  I like you less today, but I'm pretty sure  - you're a great guy. - That's fair enough.  So just be yourself with your new lady friend.  Tell her everything you told me and Teddy today  Your favorite movies, your favorite foods  But mostly, tell her that you're feeling nervous.  She'll appreciate your honesty,  and it might take away the pressure you're feeling.  Wow. Makes sense. Thank you, Rob.  - It's Bob. - What?  Nothing. It's fine. You're welcome.  - And the robe is sexy. - Thank you.  Wow. ""Be yourself."" Wish I said that.  The guy can barely carry a mattress,  but then he pulls through down the stretch  with the poignant life lesson.  Ugh. Bobby, you're good.  Ooh! I know why that happened.  I had all these extra screws, and I thought,  ""Wait, did I bring these, or are they from the bed?""  Now I know, they are from the bed.  That's on me. Bob, give me a hand.  Got to go. Bye.  I'm sorry you're all struggling.  I had another great month.  I found about, I think, 15 more people who bought oil and  seemed excited about selling it themselves.  - Way to go, Ange. - Oh, my God.  - What? - You are like Monica.  Well, a new kind of Monica.  - A nice Monica. - Who?  Angie, you're young, and you're beautiful.  - You're glowing. - She's radiant.  And that's why you succeed at this.  People are drawn to you.  It's not the oils. It's you. It's Angie.  You could sell ice to people in Iceland.  I did. I lived in Iceland after college.  I sold ice to people who wanted ice.  Of course you did.  You don't even realize you're kind of using people.  - I am? - Kind of.  To you, this stuff sells itself, but when you sell it  to other people to sell, it's it's a weight around their neck.  A big oily weight that no one wants to buy.  Sorry, Ange, but it's kind of true.  People like us see people like you,  and it's like, ""What's your secret?""  - Yeah. Who-who doesn't want to feel pretty? - Yeah.  But there's no secret. You're in your thirties,  and you don't have three kids, and-and you have this rug.  - Oh, I love this rug. - It's a great rug.  And I wanted to feel like how I imagine you feel.  I-I wanted it so bad that I would have spent real money,  even though my family was trying to stop me, and  and now they're outside the window, listening in the bushes.  We actually can't hear much, but we get the gist.  Mommy sees you. You can come back inside.  I don't know what to say.  I guess I never thought of it that way.  And that's okay, Angie.  You don't have to think of it that way.  Look at you. Enjoy it while you got it. I did.  But now I got this, and it's even better.  Yeah, take a look at what you could have, honey.  I get your point, Linda, and you know  you don't have to pay up front for the distributor package.  There's an installment plan, and  Ange, it's not gonna happen.  - I'm listening. - Gayle, no!  Okay, okay.  Thanks for coming to rescue me, guys, and Gayle, you were right.  She's a Monica in Angie clothing.  I tried to tell you.  (laughing): You really embarrassed yourself in there.  Aunt Gayle, you still have those vials in your nose.  - Tina, shh. Shh, shh, shh. - Sorry.  (whispering): Gene, I took Ringo.  (whispering): Nice. No one will ever catch on.  (barking)  - Louise, did you take the dog? - No.  (quietly): Quiet, quiet, quiet.  We're taking him back. Let me see him.  Who's a baby? Ah, we'll take him back in an hour.  LINDA:  Hey, Ange!   GENE:  That-that-that, that is fun   LINDA:  Hey, An-An-An   Hey, Ange!   GENE:  That-that-that-that, that-that that is fun   LINDA:  Hey, An-An hey, An-An, hey, An   GENE:  That is fun   LINDA:  Hey, Ange!   GENE:  That-that-that   That that is fun."
"1  You know, it'd be cool if these menus wiped us for a change.  Yeah, like we're so clean.  Hey, Teddy. We haven't seen you in a while.  I've been working, like, three days straight  for Helen, out at her beach house.  Oh, that house. I want that house.  I want it first.  It's been nice, just me and Helen  working, talking. We've even shared a few sunsets.  I'm pretty sure one of the days,  we both looked at the sunset at the same time.  It sounds like you still have a little crush on her, Teddy.  A crush? Oh, I don't know.  Maybe. I mean, she's so, uh  - WOMAN (echoes): Helen - Ah  Are there any dances coming up you could ask her to?  Yeah, when is Handyman Prom?  What? No, a guy like me  doesn't have a chance with a lady like her.  Oh, come on. Sure, she's gorgeous and rich,  and why would she go out with you?  But also why not you, right?  - Why can't you be Cinderella? - Teddy-rella.  - Nah, nah, nah. - So what kind of work  is she having you do at her beach house?  Mostly looking in chimneys and air ducts.  - Is that a euphemism? - Why is she having you do that?  Eh, Helen thinks her late husband Larry,  who she definitely didn't kill, hid something valuable from her.  (chuckles) D-Does she know you describe her that way?  Wait, Larry was hiding stuff? Why?  I don't know, but apparently Larry liked to hide stuff  - in vents and chimneys. - 'Cause that's what you do  when you totally trust your wife who definitely didn't kill you.  - Right, right. - What did Helen think Larry hid?  A little Japanese carved figurine. It's called a netsuke.  - Netsuke? - Yeah, netsuke.  I believe it's pronounced ""Netscape.""  This one's a carving of two snails intertwined.  - On their honeymoon, maybe? - TINA: Wow. That's beautiful.  I wouldn't say beautiful, but it seems consensual?  I guess it's worth a ton.  Apparently, Larry had all sorts of wacky investments.  Japanese antiquities, vintage typewriters, real estate.  W-W-Wait, why is real estate a wacky investment?  Well, if you saw the apartment building he owned.  You know that place, a couple blocks from here, the DuMont?  Oh, yeah. Near the stop sign with the testicles  - graffitied on it. - That's the one.  I've done some handyman stuff there.  It's an interesting old place.  Nothing works in the whole building, but it's got charm.  Hold on. I wonder if Larry hid the netsuke  - at his apartment building. - Huh.  (gasps) Teddy, you got to go there and find the Netflixy.  - Netsuke. - Yeah, so you can surprise Helen with it.  Whoa, you'd score huge points with her if you did that.  - I would? - Are you kidding me?  You'd be her Prince Charming. It's a friggin' fairy tale.  Wait, I thought he was Cinderella. Now he's a prince?  He can be both, Bob.  Yeah, Dad, read a book.  Huh. I do still have keys.  Let's all go right now. We can help you find it.  Yes, let's do it for love.  And for Louise to get a super valuable snail sculpture.  No, Louise, it's not yours, even if you find it.  - (grumbles) - Come on.  Let's all help Teddy find the thing and get his dream girl.  Yeah, great. Let's close a little early  and go probably not find something somewhere.  All right.  LOUISE: Wow.  This place is older than Dad.  - No offense, Dad. - BOB: None taken.  - A lot of buildings are. - Not in this country.  Okay, so every apartment has vents and fireplaces.  And we're gonna check 'em all.  Come on, Teddy's magical future life with Helen depends on us.  And why are people gonna just let us in?  We'll tell 'em, uh, we're here to do maintenance stuff.  - You know, we'll fib a little. - Oh, boy.  ""Open up, tenant, we need to search your holes.""  There you go. Gene gets it.  So we should probably split up. There's three floors.  Bob, Gene, you guys start at the top.  - We'll meet you in the middle. - And we'll all kiss.  - Fine - (kissing sounds)  - Not now. - Okay.  Uh, d-don't bother with the elevator.  It hasn't worked in 30 years, apparently.  It's basically just a big fancy birdcage now.  So, stairs, then? Perfect.  Anyone want to trade, third floor?  OLD MAN: Hello? Who's there?  Hi, my son and I are here with Teddy the handyman.  We're here to check some pipes.  Uh, great. Come in, come in.  I-I called about the pipes a few weeks ago.  The hot water in the kitchen just trickles out.  -TMI. - Follow me. Can I get you something to drink?  Maybe some warm water from the sink, if you have an hour?  Ha. Uh, no. We're-we're good, thanks.  (whispering): Why are we looking at his pipes?  (whispering): Oh, crap. Did I say ""pipes""?  (groans) We were supposed to say ""vents.""  Or was it ""vests""? Want to check him for vests?  - You guys see a cat in here? - Um, no, no  If you do, it's not mine.  - Let it out. - Okay.  - Should we just leave? - No, we should help this guy.  I think he's blind.  (sighs) Let's look at his pipes  and then maybe we can casually switch to vents.  GENE: Then vests.  Here's where it's trickling. Sorry it's dark in here,  but you probably have your own work light, right?  Uh, uh, we, uh (clears throat)  We don't We don't have it on us.  It's in the truck. Our big butch truck for boys.  - We both drive. - Gene, stop talking.  Who'd you say you were, again?  - Oh, uh - Fleetwood Mac!  No, we're not, we're not Fleet  - We are Fleetwood Mac. - We're our  The name of our company is Fleetwood Mac.  We're handymen.  - Are you? - H-Handy?  - Yes. - We're handsy  - Gene. - Uh, well,  I'm gonna go back to my shows.  Great. Well, we'll be in here.  With our plumber butts.  Fix, fix, fix, fix, fix, fix.  LINDA: Hi.  Uh, we would like to check out your heating vents.  All, all of you?  - That's right. - Doesn't make a lot of sense.  - No, no, it does. - Oh, it does?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It makes perfect sense.  - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay. Sure, why not?  - (chuckles) Come in. - Great, thanks.  Oh, I know you.  Yeah, I, I-I swapped out  your refrigerator a couple of months ago.  Of course! Yeah, how's your back?  Uh, I thought it was gonna snap like a wishbone.  (chuckles) My wish would have been  that I didn't have a herniated disc.  - (laughs) - Eh  Would you rather have a his-niated disc?  - (laughing): His-niated. - (laughing)  - Ah. - Right.  Yeah. I'm Kathleen, by the way.  Uh, me, too. Yeah.  Uh, no. I mean, no.  - You're Kathleen. I'm Teddy. - (chuckles)  Whoa. Chemistry alert.  Uh, what sport are you watching here?  Wha-What is this, grass hockey or something?  - People polo? - (laughing): People polo?  Pl - -No, it's hurling. -Hurling? What ?  What-What's hurling?  Well, it's-it's like if hockey, soccer, and baseball  had a baby, and then that baby joined a gang  Hey, Mom, Louise, quick hallway meeting?  Did you guys see Teddy and Kathleen in there?  - They're really hitting it off. - No. Tina, what?  - We're here for Teddy and Helen. - And the netsuke.  Just saying, we're-we're here to help Teddy find love,  but what if it's not with Helen?  Listen, when rich and beautiful Helen sees Teddy  marching in there with that nutsky  - Netsuke. - She is going to pick him up  and carry him away, and they're gonna live happily ever after  - in her beach house castle. - 'Cause she's rich.  Well, maybe Teddy doesn't need a rich Princess Charming  to pick him up and carry him away.  Maybe he needs a nice lady  with either a charming speech impediment  or a cool accent I can't tell  In a sensible apartment to watch weird sports with.  Sorry, Mom. I'm on Team Kathleen.  Well, I'm on Team Helen.  Remember, we're here to make Teddy and Helen a reality  Pfft. Well, I'm here to make Teddy and Kathleen a reality.  Helen and Teddy are gonna toast me at their wedding,  and you are gonna have to clap and smile nice.  Well, I'll try and get you an invitation  to Kathleen and Teddy's wedding but no promises.  And it's probably going to be a destination wedding  - in wherever Kathleen's from. - I want to say Pennsylvania?  (Kathleen and Teddy laughing)  Too bad Kathleen's bonding up a storm with Teddy,  and Helen's not even here  - Damn. - There she is.  Um, hi.  Oh, she's even better looking than I remember.  Oh, boy.  - What's going on? - Helen, hey. (nervous laugh)  What-what-what what are you doing here?  - How about you first? - I was looking for that, uh,  uh, thing of Larry's, and these Belchers were helping me.  Well, that's fun that you shared that information  with so many people.  This thing has a lot of sentimental value for me.  Maybe actual value. Who knows?  You know, this feels like a reward situation,  since this thing has so much  sentimental value, right? I mean right?  (laughs) Yes, yes, of course let's have a reward.  How does $20 sound?  Oh like not enough money. $50.  (chuckling) Well, aren't you a little businesswoman?  - Okay, deal. - Thousand. $50,000.  - Louise. Shushies. - Oh, you're Larry's widow.  Oh, I'm so sorry. Losing a husband really sucks.  I know, I I lost one, myself.  Yeah, it's rough.  It's really, really rough stuff.  - Who's this? - That's Kathleen.  She lives in 1-A.  Larry was a nice guy and a delight of a neighbor.  What do you mean, neighbor?  Neigh-bor. Am I saying that right? Neigh-bor?  He stayed here when he was in town? In his apartment? 3-B?  Uh, I mean, of course I know he had an apartment here. Duh.  Yeah, you were you were saying it weird.  That son of a bitch had a secret man cave.  - Did-did it work now? - No.  - Now? - No.  So, keep doing this a hundred more times?  Well, turning this thing is the full extent  of my plumbing knowledge. Wait. Did it work now?  - No. - Now?  - Hell no. - Why hell no?  Just switching it up.  Old baseball mitts, vintage board games.  It's like he filled this place  with everything I wouldn't let him have at home.  So, Kathleen, I love your hair. Tell me.  How long ago did your husband pass away?  Appropriate time to start dating again ago?  Smooth, T. Perfect.  Eight years ago. He was hit by a train.  Oh. I'm so sorry. That's terrible.  Oh. Did you sue the city for millions?  Oh, you Americans.  Suing for millions isn't gonna bring him back.  Plus, you know, he loved trains.  - Uh, who doesn't? - Booze cart? What?  Teddy, come here. Help me fix Helen a drink.  - Come on, come on, come on. - Okay.  (groans)  Well, good luck finding what you're looking for.  - Uh, where are you going? - Back to my apartment.  - It's where I keep my telly. - But wait!  Don't you want to stay and talk with Teddy? Oh, she's gone.  Helen, look at Teddy pour these drinks  He's like friggin' Tom Cruise in Cocktail.  Yeah, I went to bartending school.  Best four years of my life.  - Ooh, make me a Mai tai! - A what?  Helen, do you mind if I smash this vase?  Oh, please do. I hate that vase.  - Yes. - LINDA: Louise, no.  Damn it. Where are you going?  After Kathleen. I've got a match to make.  I'll join you. Maybe Larry's secret apartment  is too obvious a place to hide a secret.  - Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? - It's going weird. You?  Same. Dad, are you lost?  Um, no. We're helping this guy in 3-A.  I just can't figure out where this pipe goes to.  If these two go to the radiator, what is this one?  - Maybe it goes to your butt? - Yeah, Dad. Check it.  - Oh, hey guys. - What you eating?  - Cold pasta. - Hot damn.  Do you want some?  Mmm. Mmm, mmm.  This is cold pasta, all right.  I'm gonna look around your apartment,  but it'll be totally normal. Ignore me.  Okay ?  Speaking of cold pasta what do you look for in a fella?  Uh, I suppose I-I like guys that are kind  - Check. - And strong.  Super check. Hey, Teddy, we need you down in 1-A, buddy!  And brilliant! I wouldn't kick brilliant out of bed  - for fartin' up the sheets. - Brilliant. Uh-huh.  . - Um, still come on down, Teddy!  There in a sec!  And, uh, you know who's never had an STD?  Teddy pretty sure.  Hmm. Not really listening, but great.  - He was in the Navy, but, uh - Uh-huh.  Sounds like they need me i1-A.  I'm just gonna pop down there real quick.  Hurry back! You got to be the one to find the neti-potski!  Right, right, right.  Teddy, wait! We-We've got a plumbing thing in here.  How do you, um, do plumbing?  Wish I had time, guys, but, uh  here's a pliers, a wrench, and a screwdriver. Godspeed.  So, these guys'll just know what to do, right?  The wrench will. The screwdriver doesn't know anything.  And don't ask the pliers!  (panting): Hi. You rang?  Yes, but first, you've got something in your eye.  -I do? -Oops, uh, where'd my glasses go?  Kathleen, can you take a really long look at Teddy's eyes?  Okay.  Hmm, they're kind of bloodshot. What am I looking for?  I have been welding without a mask.  Teddy, look into Kathleen's eyes, deeply.  Wait, who's got something in their eye?  I'm seeing eye boogies.  You want me to get 'em out or are we leaving them in?  - What are we doing? - Let's leave 'em in.  Well, it's not in the fireplace. Who's got a wet wipe?  LINDA: Teddy?  Can you come upstairs to 2-B?  - Damn it. - Okay, coming!  2-B? Uh, 2-B continued. Am I right, Kathleen?  Not necessarily. People could leave my apartment.  That's an option.  Uh, okay, I should label these, probably.  (chuckles) Oh, it's one of these.  (grunts) Okay. No. Ah, ah! No. Ah! Not that one.  Ah! It's not that one, either. Here we go.  - Okay. - Not that time! (grunting)  Come on! There we go. Open sesame.  (chuckles) Here we are. Apartment 2-B.  Currently empty. Nope.  Hello, sir. You look terrified.  Boy, Teddy the handyman. Such a handy man.  Imagine having someone around all the time  that could fix stuff for you. (whistles)  Yeah. Especially around here,  where everything breaks or leaks or smells.  And no one licensed has ever stepped foot in this building.  Hell, even Larry would pick up a hammer sometimes.  Try and nail down the loose boards in the stairway.  And he did some plumbing in the upstairs hallway,  for some reason.  Plumbing in the upstairs hallway, you don't say.  - Well, I did say. - You did.  - Yeah, I just said it. - Uh, excuse us.  Tina girl, the pipes, the pipes are calling.  - What? - Pipes? Pipes are calling?  - You know, the song? - ""Danny Boy.""  -Yeah, yeah, it's good. -Yeah. It's ""the pipes are calling.""  - It's good. - It's the  Ugh, you know what, it-it doesn't  You don't even need to know the song, just come with me.  Dad said he couldn't figure out where this pipe went.  What if it doesn't go anywhere? (grunting)  (screams)  TINA: Holy crap, you found it.  Come on, let's collect our dough and go.  Right, we tell Helen,  we get a reward, and then we leave,  and we'll never know if Kathleen and Teddy were meant to be.  Yup. Good plan. Let's do that.  Unless we don't because we never found the netsuke.  What Kathleen and Teddy need is more time  for their romance to blossom.  Come on, let's get this guy back in its pipe.  Whoa, but what about the reward?  We'll ""find"" it again in a little bit,  after Teddy and Kathleen realize they're falling in love.  Then you'll get your reward.  And you'll do my restaurant chores for a month. Deal?  Fine, whatever. Who's the super-matchmaker now, huh?  - Um, you are? - Damn friggin' right I am.  Okay, treasure re-hidden, good, good.  Now let's get back to forcing Kathleen and Teddy together.  (sighs) The beginning of every great love story.  - (Helen and Teddy laughing) - Crap. Teddy's with Helen.  It's coming from the laundry room.  What's going on in here?  - Nothing. We're just venting. - (laughter)  I've been waiting a long time to say that.  - Totally worth it. - (laughs)  Okay, we can laugh and look.  Huh, candles.  I might've lit a couple. Maybe it's romantic, who knows?  Ugh! Come on, Louise.  Okay, this might work. We, uh, we loosened it  and, uh, then we tightened it. I feel pretty good about this.  - (grunting) Okay, does it work now? - No.  Oh, crap. Just lie to me at this point.  - GENE: Really? - No.  Happy to lie to you about your hair.  - BOB: What's wrong with it? - Nothing.  - Wait, does it work now? - (water running)  - Yes! - Really?  - Yes! What did you do? - I turned the thing!  I thought that's what you were doing before.  Uh, I was turning it wrong, but let's not focus on that.  We fixed the sink!  We fixed the sink! Come up to me.  I need to hold you.  I'm coming!  (grunting) This might take a minute.  Here, let me pull on your ear.  Ow! Don't pull!  Let me look at your little beautiful face!  - I'm out! We did it! - Oh, we did it!  We did it!  You two sure are happy about doing your job.  - Oh, uh, yeah, well, we, uh - I'm kidding.  You're my new favorite handymen.  I'm gonna recommend Fleetwood Mac to all my friends.  (metal clanks)  Is that sound what I think it is?  No. No, definitely not.  Eh, come in, I guess?  Hey, Kathleen, I had such a hankering  for more of that cold pasta.  Mind if I help myself? Cool, thanks.  She couldn't stop talking about it.  Yeah, the secret's letting it sit in the fridge  for a couple of weeks.  Oh, man! I-I got red sauce all over this dish towel.  - You clumsy fool. (grunting) - Ooh.  Wait. Wha-What's-what's happening?  - Are you are you people okay? - Kathleen,  you got to get this towel to the laundry room right now.  Come with us? Show us where it is? Fix your hair?  No, never mind. Th-There's no time, you look great.  - Move it. - Coming through.  - Now you're st pushing. - Hey, girls.  Bit of an emergency here. Teddy, I need you and Kathleen  to stand shoulder to shoulder  It's okay if your shoulders touch  And rub stain remover on this towel.  - Hurry. - Okay.  It-It's a little cramped in here,  - so, Helen and Mom, can you guys leave? - No.  How about we don't worry about a towel right now?  Yeah, I don't even wash that towel ever.  That's not a pattern; that's just stains.  May I remind all the children that whoever finds  the special item we're looking for will get 50 bucks?  Oh, yeah, we're looking like crazy for that thing.  We're just um, Th-this towel situation came out of nowhere.  - Oh, really? - Speaking of rewards,  I feel like you'd get that special item way faster  if you doubled it.  Tina, Louise. A word.  You're acting weird. What's up with this towel crap?  Girls, talk.  We're not hiding anything, Mom, you're hiding anything.  And we haven't found anything, either. So that's sett-settled.  (gasps) You found the netsadoodle, didn't you?  Pfft. Wh-What? Pfft. As if.  - Louise, am I wrong? - What's it worth to you?  - Louise. - What? I can't negotiate?  All right, here's the offer.  Tell me where it is and you're both not grounded.  Here's my counteroffer you're grounded.  These are terrible offers, both of them.  (growling): Where is it?!  Teddy, come with me.  There's a fire in the toilet.  A dummy pipe. Course it's in a dummy pipe.  I'm the dummy that didn't think of that.  You're not a dummy, Teddy. You're a smarty.  Because you found this all on your own, remember?  And Helen's gonna fall in love with you because of it,  and because of who you are inside and stuff like that,  - and not how you smell. - Right. Sure.  Ah! Let me see it.  HELEN: Linda, where are you?  Helen. Ah!  BOTH: No, no, no, no, no.  Crap.  HELEN: Oh, Linda, where'd my looking buddy go?  You're the one that reaches in all the gross places.  (laughing): Down in a sec!  - Where'd it go? - There it is.  (grunting)  This looks totally safe.  You know, if I, uh, took a step or two,  uh, I could probably get it.  No. Lin, if anyone's going out there, it should be me.  Here I go. Cinderella time.  Okay. Be careful, Teddy. Try-try to be light.  Yeah, I-I-I got to be really Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ah!  Teddy! Are you all right?  Yeah. I can easily hold on for another minute or less.  - Teddy? Are you up there?! - TEDDY: I am!  - Are you okay? - Uh, sort of.  Well, uh, yeah, see, he found the netslinky and then he, uh  He found the netsuke? I'll be right up. (panting)  - Oh, now I see him. Oh, Lordy. - Crap, crap, crap, crap.  We cleaned up the water, we screwed the faucet back on  No, not all of it. Not all the way. I mean,  hopefully a real plumber will come and fix everything.  Yeah, but he won't have a hot little son working  with him like you do.  Bob, come here.  What the hell? What happened?  - I don't want to talk about it. - Should we call the fire department?  Sure, if they can come in the next 20 seconds  'cause my hands are starting to slip.  Can we get the elevator back to his feet?  But how do we do it? It's broken.  You got to do it manually.  Th-Th-There's a lever on the roof.  It's a brake for the counterweight.  I-If you release it, the elevator car should go up.  BOB: Uh, okay, Teddy, I-I'm going to the roof.  The father and hot son plumbing team is going to the roof!  So, uh, where's the netsuke now?  - Helen, hi. - Hi, Teddy.  I found that thing that you want.  Yes, I know. Thank you very, very much.  - Where is it? - I kind of lost track of it.  Last time I saw it, it was on the roof of the elevator.  (gasps) There it is.    BOB: Whoa.  TEDDY: Are you up there?!  Yeah! We-we found the pulleys and stuff!  -TEDDY: Great! -And it doesn't look complicated at all!  Do you know which one we're supposed to pull? Or push?  I have no idea.  Dad, just guess the right one.  BOB: Okay, okay, uh  - Did that work? - No.  - Did that work? - No!  - This is our process. - Hang on, Teddy.  Okay, trying another one!  - TINA: It's working. - Wait, wait, wait. Stop. Stop!  Uh, okay, stopping.  - Why? - (grunts)  - Uh, wha-what's going on? - If the elevator keeps going up,  my netsuke could fall off and break.  But if the elevator doesn't go up,  then Teddy will fall.  Probably. I have no feeling left in my hands.  But there's a chance he might not fall.  And that's just a risk we'll have to take.  What? Are you serious?  Don't say it like that. He'll be fine. Maybe.  - Oh, my God, Helen's horrible. - Yeah, she is.  I don't know if I can hold on much longer.  Uh, okay, I'm pushing it again.  - No! - ALL: Yes, push it!  (grunting) Gotcha!  Oh, boy, oh, boy.  I-I'm slipping. (screams)  - BOB: Are you okay?! - I-I am okay.  (Gene and Bob whooping)  We did it. We saved Teddy and fixed the faucet.  We we didn't fix the faucet.  Uh, getting a little close to the ceiling, Bob.  Want to push that lever back the other way?  Sorry, sorry, sorry. Doing it.  - Teddy. Oh, you're okay. - Teddy. -T, thank God.  LOUISE: Get in here.  Cool. Glad you're okay, Teddy.  That's good. Well, got to go, you guys,  you know, maybe to an auction house, maybe not.  Who knows how late they're even open.  Whoa, whoa, whoa-hey!  What, that's it? What about the reward?  Well, here's the problem. No cash.  - Oh, my God. - Ooh, online gift card?  - Check your e-mail. Bye. - LOUISE: Ugh, no. Wha  (screams) Oh, my netsuke.  Yeah. That's the loose board.  HELEN: Ah. Just a little crack. It's okay. It's  - (cat screeches) - (screams)  Ah, son of a bitch! It broke!  (groans) Stupid cat. Stupid snails.  - Stupid dead Larry! - Keep in touch.  So, Larry had a secret apartment.  Uh, seems healthy.  Teddy, I'm so sorry I almost got you killed  getting the Napster back.  I was on a crazy matchmaking high.  - Netsuke. - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  - NescafÃ©. - Perfect.  (sips) Mmm, that's good.  I'm sorry, too, Teddy. If I hadn't re-hidden that thing,  you never would have been in that elevator shaft.  I forgive you guys.  You were thinking of my best interests.  Kinda. Maybe.  You know, I thought looking for the thingy was a fairy tale,  and Teddy was supposed to end up with the young rich princess.  But maybe not. Maybe he's supposed to end up  with a nice princess in sweatpants.  Wait, what's going on?  Shh, shh, shh. Kathleen, didn't you have  a wobbly cabinet door in your kitchen?  Yeah, they're all wobbly.  Want Teddy to handyman it up?  Oh, yeah, Teddy, you want to take a look at that?  I don't know. I-I can't move my fingers very well.  Uh, is that water coming in under the door?  On it.  (Ã  la ""You Make Loving Fun""):  You  You make plumbing fun  It's all I wanna do  You  You make plumbing fun  LOUISE: All right.  It's all I wanna do  -  You, Dad -  Gene  You make plumbing fun  LOUISE: Uh-huh.  It's all I wanna do  -  My son -  You  You make plumbing fun  LOUISE: Yes!  It's all I wanna do."
"1  Valentine's Day?  Uh, Lin, are you saying something?  No. Uh, just something in my throat.  I can't believe they've been acting like this all day.  This is the weirdest Valentine's Day ever.  I don't even understand what exactly happened.  I saw the whole thing. It was awful.  Aw. Good morning, my baby Bobby.  Happy Valentine's Day. Oh!  Bob, I just tripped over a pile of your dirty laundry.  Oh, uh, uh, sorry.  Maybe, uh, just walk around it?  No, I'm not gonna walk around it.  Why is it even there?  Well, you have your pile of dirty laundry.  Well, it's Valentine's Day, so,  you know, maybe you could just move it.  Or we could ignore it. That's romantic.  Well, if this is your idea of being romantic,  it's not working on me.  On a scale of this to Michael Bolton, this is this.  You don't have to bring up Michael Bolton  - every Valentine's Day. - Oh, here we go.  I'm never gonna be your Michael Bolton!  You don't even try to be him, Bob!  I grew my hair long once!  Wow. That is dumb.  And now Mom's weird idea that we all go  on this family Valentine's date is even weirder.  Ugh. I'm just worried they're still gonna be  in a bad mood when they find out about  the bed.  Jumping on Gene's bed!  - Jumping on Gene's bed! - Aah! Aah!  Kids, let's go.  We're leaving for the theater now.  Looks fine.  Well, hopefully, this movie will soften them up.  Mom's a sucker for romantic comedies.  Yeah. She would watch Four Hundred Weddings  and a Thousand Funerals if she could.  And Dad pretends he doesn't like them,  but every time he sees one, he dad-cries,  and then downloads the soundtrack.  When this movie is over, they won't care about a broken bed.  They'll be too busy making awful middle-aged love.  Aw.  On your left, you'll see the,  um, uh, well, uh, the, uh, famous London Tube.  And on your right, you'll see, uh, well, uh, Big Ben.  And up ahead, you'll see the, uh, um, uh, eh, the  the Royal Garden where the princess enjoys,  uh, tea with her,  - um, family. - He puts the glamor in stammer.  Enjoys tea with her family?  Who could enjoy anything with those stuffy bores?  Crap. Mom and Dad still look mad.  Give it a second.  I think we're almost at the romantic part.  Are you guys seeing all these Whoppers on the floor?  I'm gonna pick 'em up just to throw them away.  I, um, hope you enjoyed the, uh, uh, tour,  Your Highness.  - Shh! - Aha!  I knew you were the princess!  How did you know it was me?  I recognized your, um, famously,  uh, slightly large nose.  It's a fake one. It's my disguise.  Oh! Oh, my God. I'm-I'm so sorry.  I'm kidding. I'm kidding.  It's my own nose. See? Look.  Honk-honk.  I love this.  I-I just wanted one normal day  outside the palace. Please don't tell anyone.  It's a, um, uh, uh, deal.  - Brilliant. Brilliant. - Brilliant. Brilliant.  - Brilliant. - Brilliant.  -Brilliant. -Brilliant. -Here it comes.  Bring us home, Rom-com.  - Wha - What the hell?  That's it? Rom-com, thank you, Mom?  No, kids, the movie's not over.  There must be some kind of problem.  Uh, hi, everyone.  It seems we have a small fire, popcorn-related.  Anyway, since I'm not allowed to scream ""fire""  in a crowded theater, I'll just say it calmly.  Fire.  Mm, stupid  Of course there's a fire  Well, that was a bust.  At least we got a voucher for a free movie.  No, I mean it was a bust because we need the movie  to soften them up, remember?  What are you kids talking about?  Yeah. What's with all the sister-whisper back there?  We were just talking about what a super romantic ending  that movie probably had.  And, uh Gene is gonna tell you all about it.  Yeah. Sure.  Here's what happens.  The queen finds out that her daughter, the princess,  whose name is Paula McCartney  - Paula McCartney? - Yep. Princess Paula McCartney.  - Good, good. Moving on. - Has escaped the palace!  - And the queen's like - Boy, am I mad  at my slightly big-nosed daughter.  I'm the queen!  So she calls for her best beefeater to track down the princess.  - He says - Righty-O.  I'll just finish up this spot of beef,  and I'll have a looky for her royal heinie.  So the Princess Paula McCartney and the tour guide  are being chased through the streets, but they still  had time to bond and be charming.  By the way, we haven't been properly introduced.  My name is Scott Jon Dan Steve.  Wait. What? That's his name?  Yeah. The character's name Scottjon Dansteve.  Oh.  - Well, Mr. Dansteve - Please call me Scottjon.  Move over. I'm driving.  Scottjon Dansteve decides  to call his best mate for some help,  a soccer hooligan named  Johnny Nottinghill!  - Johnny's like - I'm watching footie  on the telly in the pubby where the beer is.  You coming down or not, Scottjon?  No! But I do need your help!  Meanwhile, the beefeater is gaining on the bus.  Just as he's closing in, he's bombarded by soccer balls!  From guess who.  - The hooligan! - That's right! Johnny Hooligan!  I thought his name was Johnny Nottinghill.  Right. Shush. The beefeater  jumps on the bus,  - and he's like - Princess Paula McCartney,  there's an exploding scone somewhere on this bus.  If the bus goes under 50 miles per hour, it will explode.  Don't English people say ""kilograms""?  - Kilometers. - Actually, no, they use miles.  - We studied it in school. - Nerd.  - What? - Oh, okay.  If the bus goes under 50 miles per hour,  it will explode!  I guess you could say we're in a bit of a jam.  'Cause of the scone.  So, wait. There's an exploding scone on the bus?  Is that  Do you not know how scones work? They're incredibly dense!  There's all kinds of scones, Bob.  I know there are all kinds of scones, Lin.  I'm just saying, why is it on a bus?  There can't be a scone on a bus? God!  Forget it. You're right. Fine.  Well, at least they're actually talking now.  Yeah, but they're still fighting.  We got to soften them up more than this  before we get home and they see the broken bed.  Gene, try to put some romance in your story.  Got it. Anyway  the beefeater tells Scottjon  and Princess Paula McCartney that the person  who planted the scone was none other than Big Ben.  - I should have known. - Who's Big Ben?  My arch-rival. He's always been jealous  that I'm the best tour guide in the city.  Now he's found a way to destroy me  and everything I love.  Are you talking about the bus?  Yes. And you.  - Watch out for that tube! - Princess Paula McCartney  looks up to see  that they are headed right into a giant tube!  Gene, you know the London Tube isn't an actual tube, right?  And also, Big Ben is a clock, not a person.  - Okay, Professor Dumbledore. - Hmm.  They miss the tube just barely,  but they still don't know how  they're going to get off that bus!  What are we going to do, Scottjon?  I have an idea. Turn left up here  where David Bowie and Mick Jagger danced in the street.  Then turn right up here where Sir Ian McKellen once farted.  Wow. You really are the best tour guide in the city.  Look out!  They're headed straight for a giant pile  of dirty laundry.  Big Ben had  strategically placed piles  of dirty laundry all around the city,  making it almost impossible to drive.  Piles of dirty laundry?  Are you talking about the movie or or me?  Sometimes stories are so universal, it feels like  -they're speaking directly to all of us. -Mm.  Scottjon Dansteve  and Princess Paula McCartney find themselves  headed straight for the London Bridge,  which everyone knows is falling down,  because there's a hit song about it.  Um, I think you mean Tower Bridge.  That's the famous one, but whatever.  Don't bridge-splain me, Father!  This was your idea, Scottjon? The Tower Bridge?  I didn't realize there was a gap in the middle of it!  You know what we have to do, right?  Yes.  Uh, let me guess. Does she say, ""Mind the gap""?  Nuh. I don't know what that is.  Mind the gap. It's-it's what they say on the  Are you saying ""mine"" or ""mind""?  - Mind. - Why would you mind a gap?  - You don't worry about it. - As I was saying  You know what we have to do, right?  Yes. Jump the gap.  That's exactly right. We have to jump the gap.  - Oh, my God. - Reminiscent of, but not at all  plagiarizing Speed, the bus launches off the bridge.  We did it!  They make the jump,  but dot-dot-dot  The bus's brakes don't work.  Luckily, at the end of the road  was a giant pile of broken beds.  The bed factory! Of course.  Maybe we can use them to absorb the impact.  Yes. Broken beds are incredibly good and great.  The bus slams into the pile of broken beds.  The princess and Scottjon ride the beefeater out of the bus  as if he was a toboggan,  just as the scone explodes  and dirty piles of laundry fly everywhere!  On the ground, they lie on the beefeater,  being super romantic, and he's cool with it.  Let's get married, have kids and never, ever get mad at them.  The princess is like  - Yep! - And they kiss.  And that's the movie.  The end. Roll credits.  What are you feeling? What are you thinking?  Wow. I don't know about you guys, but I need a moment.  Mom, Dad, you guys must be feeling pretty Valentine-y now, huh?  Uh, what was the deal with the broken beds?  - Why were they there? - Beds break, okay?  - It's part of life. Grow up. - Whoa. Okay, Tina.  Well, thank you for finishing it for us, Gene.  - It was it was very exciting. - Yeah.  Too bad life isn't like a movie and people disappoint you.  Mm-hmm, yeah, and sometimes people are clumsy,  and they trip on things that are perfectly fine to be there.  Um, actually, I-I don't think  Gene finished the movie.  Uh, I-I mean, great start, but, uh, there's more.  Scottjon Dansteve and Princess Paula McCartney  survive the exploding scone,  but that's just the beginning of their problems.  They're kissing like crazy on top of the beefeater,  but he's got something to tell them. He says  Beg your pardon, Your Highness. I've been sent to remind you  that you're expected to attend the royal wedding this evening.  I completely forgot. Wait.  Scottjon, why don't you come as my date to this silly affair?  Uh, I-I'd love to. Uh, the-the problem is,  only nobility and fancy people can attend a royal wedding.  I'm just a humble commoner.  Well, then let's get noble.  - Nobility makeover! - Yay.  Princess Paula McCartney gets to work  teaching Scottjon Dansteve how to fit in  with fancy royal people.  First, she teaches him how to cross his legs at the knee.  Then at the thigh, then at the butt.  Let's practice that one more time, just the butt thing.  Once more. And again.  Once more, please. Again.  - Oh, all right, Tina. We get it. - And after all that preparation,  there was only one thing left to do:  teach Scottjon Dansteve how to speak.  Scottjon, my dear, you know I love your charming stammer,  but it simply will not do.  At least, not tonight when you're giving your speech.  Speech? Um, uh, w-well,  I-I don't even know whose wedding this is.  It's mine. I'm betrothed to the Duke of Douchebury,  and I need a nobleman  to object to the marriage, or I'm stuck with him.  If Scottjon Dansteve wants to be  with Princess Paula McCartney,  he has to give a speech in front of the queen  without stammering.  Princess Paula McCartney, I will not let you  - um, uh, uh, down. - That's crap, isn't it?  I can't believe Princess Paula McCartney has to marry  the horrible Duke of Douchebury.  Oh, uh, hold on a minute, Lin.  You don't know anything about this guy.  Just because his name is Douchebury  doesn't mean he's a Wait a minute, never mind.  I-I don't know why I'm saying anything.  Go on with your story, Tina,  and do even more of that lovey-dovey stuff.  On it. The royal wedding was to be a river wedding  on board a cruise liner.  Ooh, a cruise liner. Fancy.  All the guests stroll down  to the docks, including Scottjon Dansteve,  who now looks as noble as the next guy.  He passes by his mate Johnny Nottinghill  outside the pubby. Johnny Nottinghill's like,  ""Hey, Scottjon, you want to watch footie with me?""  Shh! I'm off to ruin a, um, a-a posh wedding.  On the cruise liner, the wedding gets underway,  and the queen herself is in attendance.  And she's waving, and she's waving.  When it comes time to ask if anyone  has any objections, Scottjon Dansteve stands up.  - I object! - The crowd gasps.  And the vicar says, ""Right, then.  ""Clearly by the way you cross your legs at your butt  ""even while you're standing, you are of noble birth.  Please smoothly orate to us the reason for your objection.""  I object for the reason that  um, that, uh  Wh uh, eh, wh um  But just then a huge boom jolts the entire cruise liner.  Seamen spill out all over the deck.  Tina! Oh, wait. You mean sailors.  - Never mind. Go on. - Wait, what?  - What did you think I meant? - Nothing, nothing.  - It's fine. You're fine. - Anyway,  there's a ton of seamen all over the place.  - Oh, my God. - One of them screams,  ""It's a giant pile of dirty clothes  ""floating in the river. Evacuate!  We've hit a laundry-berg!""  A laundry-berg? No!  A laundry-berg? Really?  - That's what sunk the ship? - Well, if you must know, Dad,  what really sunk the ship was human arrogance.  Hmm.  Everyone starts jumping into the water  as the ship sinks.  Luckily, floating nearby, Princess Paula McCartney  finds a broken bed.  Thank God for this broken bed.  Broken beds are way better than non-broken beds.  Wait, what's with all the broken beds?  I know, right? It probably  means something cool.  Anyway, Scottjon Dansteve stayed by the princess's side.  I'm here, Princess, and, uh, uh  and I will never leave you.  Just then, a dinghy floats by  with the Duke of Douchebury. He's like  I knew I heard you stammering before.  You're a commoner.  Other dinghies full of royals float by,  and they start murmuring again.  Now, listen here, all of you.  Yes, this man is a commoner.  And yes, he's quite unkempt.  And yes, he probably has to flush his own toilet.  And yes, he may be loaded with diseases  like rotten legs, pub penis, ordinary skin syndrome  - Uh, um - Sorry, sorry. My point is  - Oh, oh! Wave! - But at that moment,  a huge wave crashes on top of them,  sending Scottjon Dansteve down the river.  No!  So, wait, there's a wave? In a river?  Oh, an exploding scone on a bus is fine,  but there can't be a wave in a river?  I'm just saying, rivers don't have waves.  - Yeah, but the scone. - Forget about the scone, Bob.  I can't forget about the scone, Lin!  And though their love  will live on forever,  that's the last time Princess Paula McCartney  ever sees Scottjon Dansteve, 'cause he's dead.  Eventually, she moves to America,  has eight kids who she never gets mad at, and grows old.  But every time she trips over a pile  of dirty laundry, she thinks of him.  The end.  Wait, what? That's the end?  Yeah, basically. Um, anyway, what do you think?  It has everything, right? Tragedy? Action? Passion?  Huh. I guess. Kinda.  I mean, I'm glad you finished it.  Also, it's perfect timing, 'cause we're home.  Everyone go up. I'll park the car.  Well, some Valentine's Day that was.  Oh, God. We're back at the scene of the crime,  and they're still in a bad mood.  We're gonna get grounded so hard.  I can't take it, man. I can't take it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold on.  We can't get out of the car yet.  - There's more to the movie. - There is?  Yes. Gene and Tina forgot to tell you  the super exciting, crazy dramatic,  ultra-romantic finale after the finale.  Uh, Louise, can you just tell us when we get upstairs?  Or maybe just write it down somewhere?  I have to tell you before we go in the house.  It's super quick.  Let's all park the car together,  and we'll just let her tell us, right, Bob?  All right.  - Let's hear it. - So, after being  tossed around in the river, Scottjon Dansteve  washes up, coughing.  Turns out he's not dead, Tina,  - and he's happy to be alive. - I'm alive.  But he's sad that he lost  his Princess Paula McCartney  to the Duke of Douchebury.  Luckily, he's really close to home,  which is a flat above an English muffin shop,  which, if you're in England, is just called a muffin shop.  He lived there with his hooligan mate,  Johnny Nottinghill.  And it wasn't a great flat.  Pretty crappy, actually,  and full of little piles of dirty laundry.  - I knew it. - All right, Johnny,  - let's watch some footie. - Suddenly,  there's a sound behind him. He turns around.  Princess Paula McCartney is standing  in the doorway of his flat.  - Honk, honk. - Princess Paula McCartney.  Hello, Scottjon Dansteve.  Oh, um, sorry. Uh, can I introduce you  to Johnny Something-face.  Johnny's like, ""Ello. Football to ya.""  Scottjon, look, I was scared of what my family would think,  but I realize now that it's all rubbish.  I'm just a girl standing in front of a tour guide  next to his football friend above an English muffin shop,  which is just a muffin shop,  holding in a toot, asking him to  Just then, she trips over something.  Scottjon, I've just tripped over your pile of dirty laundry.  Oh, um, sorry.  Uh, perhaps just, uh, walk around it?  ""Just walk around it""?  Don't you have your own piles of dirty laundry at the palace?  Yes, but perhaps you could simply move it.  Or we could, um, ignore it?  Which I find equally romantic.  If that's what you fancy  as romance, Scottjon,  then I want no part of it.  On a scale of one to Sir Michael Bolton,  I consider this this.  It's the dumbest argument ever.  But as they fight, something strange starts to happen.  Piles of laundry  begin to rise up and swirl around them.  Scottjon and Princess Paula McCartney  are so wrapped up in their argument that they don't see  that the laundry piles have formed a twister  the size of a building.  So, it's a supernatural twister of laundry.  You know what? You're  right. Not believable.  Anyway, some other stuff happens.  You don't want to hear it. Long day. We're home. The end.  Wait, wait, wait. You can't stop there.  They end up together, right?  W-We do want to hear it. Just tell us how it ends.  - Tell us. - Okay, fine.  Scottjon and Princess Paula McCartney  don't realize that all their negative energy is creating  a-a-a  a laundry-nado!  Oh, laundry-Na-do you didn't.  Scottjon Dansteve and Princess Paula McCartney's argument  threatens the whole town, but they have no idea.  They're too busy arguing like dumb idiots.  Like dumb, stupid, arguing idiots.  Okay, take it easy, Louise.  - Argue. Argue. - Argue.  - Argue, argue. Argue. - Argue, argue. Argue.  A bed from the flat  is whipped up into the sky  and snapped like a twig.  Uh, let me guess.  Does the broken bed somehow fix all of this?  No, it doesn't.  This time, not even a broken bed could save them.  Although, that's a really good guess,  because broken beds usually are great.  But no. They realize that the laundry-nado  is making a noise.  Sorry!  I-I think it's apologizing to us.  Uh, oh, okay. Apology accepted.  Not me! You!  You say sorry!  Geez.  In order to save the town,  Scottjon Dansteve and Princess Paula McCartney  would have to do the unthinkable.  They would have to apologize to each other.  Oh. That's a plot twist.  Does Scottjon apologize first?  'Cause he should.  I've never seen this movie before,  but it feels like Princess Paula McCartney  would probably apologize first.  Ugh. As long as the two lovers  refuse to say a simple ""I'm sorry"" to each other,  the laundry-nado continues to rip the town apart.  First the London Bridge falls down,  - which we all saw coming. - Tower Bridge.  Then the royal palace is wiped out.  And then Big Ben is swooped up, the clock and the guy.  Finally, realizing they're both being stupid,  stupid morons, Scottjon Dansteve  and Princess Paula McCartney agree to apologize  at the exact same time.  - One, two, three. - One, two, three.  I'm sorry I got so angry about the pile of laundry.  I was a real wanker about the whole thing.  I was just embarrassed about my dodgy flat.  I was just hoping  we could have a nice day together after my royal wedding  -and the whole exploding scone thing. -I felt bad  that you tripped on my dirty laundry.  The laundry-nado immediately goes away.  Everything falls to the ground.  Scottjon and the princess  realize they're holding hands.  There's music and stuff.  Cut to Westminster Abbey Road. I think that's a place.  They get married there.  As a wedding gift, the queen gives them  a brand-new royal bed. She says  It was surprisingly affordable.  In fact, everyone should get a new bed every once in a while  since they break pretty easily.  Then they have 15 kids, who they never get mad at,  and they live happily ever after,  and that's how the movie ends.  Fade to black. Roll credits.  Lin, I-I want to say something.  No, Bob. Let me say it first.  - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.  No, you don't need to apologize.  I was the one who was acting like a jerk.  Yeah, but I could have been nicer about it.  So, is everyone feeling less crappy, then?  Aw, my babies.  That was my favorite movie I've never seen.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  - Are you crying, Dad? - No. I  My, uh, my ch-cheeks are just sweaty.  Oh, Bobby.  I guess you could kind of say we saved your Valentine's Day, huh?  Yeah, I guess you did.  By the way, can I sleep in your bed tonight?  - Uh, wait. Why? - Why?  Because we broke Gene's bed jumping on it,  and now you probably have to buy him a new one.  Happy Valentine's Day. Love you, guys. Bye.  Run, run, run!  Oh, my God.  Jumping on the bed  Jumping on the bed  Don't fall and hit your head  When you're jumping on the bed   Jumping on the bed  Jumping on the bed  Don't fall and hit your head  When you're jumping on the bed   Jumping on the bed  Jumping on the bed, don't fall"
"1  Okay. All done. Time for school.  Tina, you're done? We just started eating.  Why do you want to go to school so badly?  Did you do your homework last night?  Today's the day they're announcing the theme  for the eighth grade dance.  (singsongy): And rumor has it they might be choosing mine.  I started that rumor.  Oh, right. Your theme. What was it again?  ""Night of the Living Dance.""  Everyone dresses up like zombies who are ready to party.  - Eatin' brains and doin' cocaine! - Gene.  I hope they choose my idea.  It was inspired by a story I wrote.  Ooh, one of your frisky, friendly what's-it-calleds?  Erotic friend s-stories.  I read it. It was erotic and highly disturbing.  - Two for two. - No, it wasn't.  I'm at the dance in my dress that's ripped up  - and covered in brains. - (Jimmy Jr. muttering)  And Zombie Jimmy Jr. Asks me to dance.  And then I fall but catch myself  by grabbing onto his butt,  - and then we - Okay, the end.  But I didn't get to the part where his butt falls off and  I want to remain in suspense.  So you and Jimmy Jr. Are going to the dance together?  Yeah. I mean, he hasn't asked me yet,  but we talked about it a while ago.  I gave him some ideas of how to ask.  A lot of people have been going the promposal route.  Not that this is prom, but it's still a big D. Deal.  Don't say ""big D.""  I told him no pressure, just do something simple.  Like take me into a grocery store,  and all the oranges spell out  ""Orange you glad you're going to the dance with me?""  Or he could sky-write it in the sky.  I need someone to sky-write these eggs into my mouth.  - Here comes the airplane. Ah! - Ah!  Hey, Dad, what are you wearing to Mom and Gene's wedding?  Uh, a suit, I guess.  MS. LABONZ (over P.A.): Good morning, Wagstaff.  Before we get started with normal announcements,  Mr. Frond has something to say.  FROND: The theme for the eighth grade dance is   ""Night of the Living Dance""! Suggested by Tina Belcher!  - (gasps) They chose my theme. - Ew.  This day can't get any better. Or can it?  Hey, Jimmy Jr., is there something you want to ask me?  Oh. Uh can I get a restroom pass?  Huh. Probably off to arrange the flash mob, I'm guessing?  Hey, guys. So you probably heard that my theme was chosen  for the eighth grade dance.  What? Sorry, I stopped listening after ""Hey, guys.""  Well, truthfully, after ""Hey.""  So, the dance committee meets after school  Uh, if you're doing dance committee after school,  who's gonna cover for you at the restaurant?  My incredibly supportive sister and brother?  They sound nice.  You guys, please? It's my theme.  Fine, we'll cover for you.  - But you've got to do something for us. - Okay.  Every day this week, when you get home from dance committee,  you have to clean the restaurant bathroom.  (gasps)  - Oh. That's where the toilet is. - Yeah.  But we take turns.  If you want to be on the committee,  it's not gonna be pretty.  Okay. Fine. It's a deal. Hey, Jimmy Jr.  Over here! Should I, uh, clear a space?  What do you need to do your big, uh, thing?  Uh, sorry, I got to, um, check out the hallway.  Oh, okay. Let me know how it is.  Hi, guys.  Aw, Gretchen, why so droopy?  I'm not wearing a bra.  No, I'm talking about your frowny face.  My sister's getting married on Saturday.  Oh, congrats.  My family told me, if I want to bring a date,  I got to bring a nice guy.  I guess the guys I've been bringing to stuff  have been ""disasters"" who ""drink too much""  and ""vomit"" on my mom's ""workout tapes.""  - BOB: Hmm. - LINDA: Huh.  If I knew any nice idiots, I would bring one.  Hey, wait. What about you?  What's your name again?  Teddy. We've met so many times.  Well, you seem nice. And you're there.  - Do you want to go with me? - I'm flattered, Gretchen, but I can't.  I'm going away this weekend.  I'm taking my mom to see Digereedudes,  the Australian all-male revue at Sun Woods Casino.  I assume it's some kind of animal show.  Ticket says ""Watch out for swinging dingoes.""  I'm never gonna find a date by this weekend.  - Yes, you will, Gretchen. I'll help you. - You will?  Yeah! What if we go on one of those dating sites?  Okay. This could be fun.  -Yeah. -I-I better get everything waxed and ready.  What do you think, Bob, bikini or Brazilian?  Or barbarian? That's where you let it  get crazy down there.  - Uh, surprise us? - Okay, I'll surprise you.  -Hey, Tina, uh, can I talk to you? -Oh, my God. This is it.  -W Uh, well -If my glasses fog up, don't be alarmed.  It's just 'cause I'm excited.  Tina, can we maybe, uh, go somewhere private?  But, if we go somewhere private, who's gonna go ""Aw""  and applaud for us after you-you ask me to the dance?  - I'm - You are going to ask me, right?  Um no. I-I'm not going to the dance.  -You're what?! -It's not that big a deal, is it?  Aah! Oh, my God! Aah!  Whoa, she just kicked a kid!  Oh, no-no-no, she just tripped. Looked like it, though.  (mumbling angrily)  Stupid Jimmy J Aah!  (mumbling continues)  Jimmy Aah!  (mumbling continuing)  - Aah! Oh! Oh, my God. - (honks)  - Are you okay? - (honks)  (sighing): Sorry, I didn't see you.  I Oh It's just this boy, Jimmy Jr.,  changed his mind and decided not to ask me  to the eighth grade dance.  And-and we talked about it. He said he was gonna ask me.  Ah! It's so messed up.  - (honks) - Exactly. You get it.  (honks)  Sorry. I just realized I'm totally venting at you.  -(honks) -You're pretty easy to talk to, though.  This is the best conversation I've had in a long time.  (honks)  If this is the best conversation you've had,  then honk on the count of three: one, two, three  Four. Five. Six.  - (honks) - I knew it.  There are some nice-looking guys on PerfectPair.  Look at this one.  Software engineer? Talk to me when you're a hardware engineer.  Mm.  How about this one?  Is he in a tank top with the nipples cut out?  Yeah. It says ""Pepperonis, anyone?"" Ha!  - What app is that? - FunBuddy.  Gretchen, you're not gonna find a nice wedding date on FunBuddy.  But the guys you're picking out look boring.  Lin, your guy does look a little boring.  I mean, it says his interests are reading and naps.  -So? I like those, too. Except the reading. -(door opens, bell jingles)  Hey, kids. Where's Tina?  Oh, she's at dance committee. Her theme got picked.  We're covering for her, so don't expect things  - to get done that quickly. - Or that well.  It's nice of you guys to cover for your sister  so she can do the dance committee.  A little too nice. What did you make her promise to do?  Father, how dare you?  We did this out of the kindness of our hearts.  And also, she's gonna clean the bathroom all week.  She insisted on that.  Speaking of bathrooms, look at this guy.  - Is he on the toilet? - (chuckles): Yeah.  He's being funny. I think.  - I'm gonna send him a message. - Gretchen, no!  And that's why I think we should send all boys to Canada  and call it Manada. And never go there.  Well, it's getting late. I'd better go.  Nice meeting you. Guess I'll see you around.  Oh, you're following me.  I think he likes you.  - Huh? - That's Bruce. Bruce the Goose.  He didn't seem to mind your long story about a dance  that you told really loudly for some reason.  Oh, sorry.  Geese can be kind of clingy.  They can form strong attachments to other birds  - and sometimes to people. - Like me?  Seems like it, huh? I tried to get him  to attach to me, but it didn't take.  Guess I wasn't sad and desperate enough.  Aw, Bruce. You're a caring guy.  Some people could learn a thing or two from you.  You're talking about Jimmy Jr.?  Yes! Ah such a jerk.  Yeah, yeah, no, no, I heard, I heard.  Such a jerk.  TAMMY: Oh, my God, I'm so excited.  Dan Esposito shaved ""Will you go to the dance with me?""  into the back of his head.  Ronald McEvoy wrote ""Will you go to the dance with me?""  with worms in science class.  He taught the worms how to spell.  (sighs)  Would you make me the happiest eighth grader  and be my date to the dance?  Oh, my God. Yes! What's your name?  - (groans) - Hey, Tina.  Can, uh, we talk for a sec?  Is it about how you changed your mind  and want to ask me to the dance?  No, sorry. But I do want to talk to you more,  'cause you seemed so mad yesterday.  Or maybe you're over it?  Tina, the dance committee meeting is starting soon.  We've got a lot of work to do for the dance.  (echoing): The dance the dance the dance.  Aah!  So, yeah, I ditched dance committee and came right here.  I'm just so sick of people.  -That's what's so great about you. -(honks)  Hey, I brought half a turkey sandwich.  Oh. Unless that's weird for you 'cause you're  -(honks) -Oh. You're eating it right out of my hand.  Okay, Gretchen, your date's gonna be here any minute.  His name's Norman, and he's a podiatrist.  That's him. He's cute, sorta.  He looks like if a banana were a person.  - Uh, are you - Hi. I'm Gretchen.  I'm Norman. Pleased to meet you.  These are our menus, and, uh, if you don't mind me saying,  you two make a lovely couple.  Oh, uh, well, we just met.  - What? Are you kidding me? - Uh  Well, I'll just give you a minute to look over the menus,  and whatever else you want to look over.  So, you work with feet? That's gross, right?  Uh, I find the foot fascinating.  Look at the sparks fly.  Uh, I don't want to be hearing or watching this.  You know, you're not gonna believe this,  but my foot's actually a urologist.  - Oh! Ooh! - Mm-hmm.  -Oh-oh! -Uh, are you guys ready to order?  - (grunts) - Ow!  I'll have a a Burger of the Day.  - Make it two. - You got it.  (whispering): Pump the brakes, Gretchen.  I'm trying to pump the brakes, Linda.  It started to go a little off the rails over there,  but I got it back on track.  Gretchen's pretending to spill mustard on her boobs.  Oh, how did that get there?  Oh, God, oh, no. I'll be right back.  (chuckles): And then this duck walked by  and dropped a piece of bread, and we tried not to laugh,  but it was so hard not to, 'cause it was so embarrassing.  Wait, you were at the park?  I thought you were at the dance committee.  Yeah, and also there's a disgusting bathroom  that didn't get cleaned because someone didn't get back  until after closing time.  Oh, yeah, sorry about that.  And also, I quit dance committee.  I'm not going to the dance anymore.  What? But you were so excited about your zombie dance.  And Jimmy Jr.  Jimmy Jr. doesn't want to go to the dance with me, okay?  Okay.  Wait. Tina, who were you with at the park again?  -A goose? -No, Bob. She wasn't with a goose.  It was a kid named Goose, right?  No, he's a goose named Bruce.  Wait, like, honk, honk. Like that kind of goose?  There's no kind of goose that sounds like that.  Don't geese kind of go, like (hissing)  - No, like this. Honk, honk. - Like a tow truck.  - (humming) - Like a car.  Stop it! Stop it! He doesn't sound like that.  He has a perfectly normal honk.  You know what? I'm gonna have the rest of my dinner in my room.  And I'm gonna have the rest  of Dad's dinner in my room.  (group vocalizing)    Okay, Gretchen. You had some lunches,  you met some nice guys.  Which one of these eligible bachelors  is gonna be your matchelor?  I don't know. They're all so boring.  So much talking, so much khaki.  I really like the guy who works at the airport.  He had a friendly face.  -But too much baggage. Am I right? -Yeah!  Send him a message. See if he wants to go.  Nah, I don't wanna.  Excuse me. There's no toilet paper in your bathroom,  and it's nasty in there.  Oh, no, uh, sorry about that. We'll-we'll clean it right away.  Oh, my God.  Have you guys cleaned the bathroom at all this week?  Tina's the one on bathroom duty, remember?  Yeah! It's not our fault she's hanging out with Goosey Lawless  instead of doing her duty!  Well, someone needs to clean it.  And that someone is you two.  Mom and Gretchen, he's talking to you.  No, you two. Now.  Oh, smell no.  I'm not ready for this!  I'm just a boy!  Oh, that's good.  Tina, we just want to remind you that we're still furious  that we had to clean the bathroom 'cause you were late.  You goose-goose-ducked us over, lady.  Guys, I'm sorry I have a life.  With Bruce.  Tina, what's with you lately?  You're ditching work to go to the pond.  You eat all your meals in your room.  And (scoffs)  are you even listening to me right now?  Hello? Hello?  (sighs) I can't believe I'm saying this,  but I kind of miss the old days,  when you would ramble on and on about the zombie dance.  You guys talking about the big dance?  Did you change your mind, Tina?  No! God, I told you, I'm not going  to the stupid dance, okay?! Everyone at school is annoying.  I don't want to be around them. I don't want  to be around anyone! Except Bruce.  I'm gonna go pee. Angrily.  Whoa. What's going on?  Uh, guys, you might want to take a peek at this.  LINDA: ""Tina and Bruce shared a love so deep ""  TINA: that it didn't matter that she was a person  and he was a goose.  No one understood their love.  So they ran away together and laid dozens  and dozens of eggs and had dozens and dozens  of babies who looked like little amazing goose people.  - Oh, God. - Hot.  - Gene. - What's happening to Tina?  It's like she got her heart hurt  and now she's shutting out the world.  She's becoming a Bruce recluse.  You know, before this goose came along,  dancing at a zombie dance with Jimmy Jr.  Was her big fantasy.  Maybe we need to get her back onto that.  Okay. How do we get her to the dance?  -Gene and Louise are gonna get her there. -We are?  Yeah. Unless you want to keep cleaning the bathroom.  Don't remind me. I can still taste it.  - What? - What?  -What are you guys talking about? -ALL: Nothing!  No one's concerned about your future hybrid  human-goose babies,  and no one read your journal either,  so just chill out!  So, wait, Tina is hanging out with a goose?  Named Bruce.  So that's why Tina's not talking to me anymore?  Tina's not talking to you because you didn't ask her  to the dance like you said you would.  You crushed her heart.  I know.  So go to the dance and fix this cluster-fart!  - But I can't, Louise! - Why?!  I have an injury.  - What? - It's embarrassing.  - Why? - Because of where it is.  Where is it?!  - My butt! - Your butt.  I was doing the dance from the movie Save the Last Dance,  and I got really lost in the moment.  And I guess I (sighs)  pulled a butt muscle.  (groaning)  I was too embarrassed to tell Tina what happened.  And I can't really dance until it heals.  I can barely do this.  - Ow. Ow. Ow. - Stop. Stop it. Stop. Just  Here's what you're gonna do. Go to the dance  and do that weird swaying thing and look happy.  Like this? Ow  Nailing it.  Hey, Lin? We're out of tomatoes.  -Can you grab some more from downstairs? -In a minute, Bob.  I'm just logging onto Gretchen's account on PerfectPair.  Oh. Does she know you're doing that?  No. But I have her password because I set up her account.  I'm gonna message that airport guy and see if he wants to go  - with her to the wedding. - Uh, that sounds  - like a really bad idea. - I know. It's smart, right?  And I think I can maybe change his mind.  Lin, don't do this. Gretchen's not gonna like it.  - I already did it. - Well, undo it.  No. There's no undo, Bob. It's done.  - Oh, wait. It didn't go through. - Oh. Good.  - Oh, now it did. - Oh, my God.  LOUISE: Okay, so, first we find the goose,  then we lure him away, and then we trap him.  And, hopefully, our very impressive  stalling Tina tactic worked.  There was a note taped to my locker  that I had a very important phone call?  I don't think so. The only call that came in today  was a prank phone call about E. coli in the lettuce.  (laughing): Everyone knows that's not a real thing.  Dangerous salad.  So where's Bruce?  All I see is a bunch of dumb ducks.  Look, a goose.  And it has a friendship bracelet on its leg.  It must be him.  Come on, boy. Come on.  - (honks) - Ha!  Sit tight. We'll come get you after the dance.  If anyone asks, you're camping.  (honks)  Bruce?! Bruce?!  - Tina! - Look who it is.  Hi, guys. What-what are you doing here?  Oh, we're not allowed to enjoy  a leisurely stroll around the park?  Okay. Um, well, you haven't seen Bruce, have you?  He usually comes right up to me.  He's got to be here somewhere.  Maybe I should speak his language.  - Honk! Honk, honk! Honk! - Hi. Hello.  - That's our sister. - Honk, honk, honk, honk!  She'd better not be saying stuff about us.  Hey, Gretch.  Oh, hi, Lin. I got a message from the airport guy  that he's gonna come with me to the wedding.  He said he ""liked my last message.""  - Oh, boy. - Oh!  That's great news!  You logged in as me and wrote that guy, didn't you?  Okay. Yes, I did.  But it was a good thing, because now you have a date.  Do you have an MBA, Linda?  'Cause you're all up in my business.  Gretchen, you might want to find a nice guy for real.  You know, for keeps.  How about this? Goodbye for keeps!  Until you need a haircut or a dye job!  But I'm not gonna give you my friends discount,  because we're not friends anymore!  - Oh, Gretchen, come on! - You're the worst!  - Oh, get a - You're the worst!  Gretchen, get away from the window!  Don't you throw that, Gretchen!  I'm I'll do it, I swear!  Calm down, Gretchen!  Don't make us call the cops, Gretchen!  - Go ahead! Call them! Attica! - Huh!  You try to help someone, and this is what you get.  Attica! Attica!  -Attica! -Lin, Gretchen is really scary right now,  but you also kind of pushed her to this point.  - What? - Attica!  Attica! Don't eat here!  Well, your help was trying to make Gretchen  - not act like Gretchen. - Don't eat here!  Kind of like what her family is asking her to do.  Hey, don't eat here!  - Oh, no. Bob, maybe you're right. - Don't eat here. Don't eat here!  - I just wanted her to be happy. - Attica!  - Attica! - I mean, she was happy,  and now she wants to break our restaurant.  Oh, thank God. She's walking away.  That was terrifying.  Bruce? Bruce?  (groans) Where is he? Guess he's gone.  Sorry, T. Hey, you know what'll cheer you up?  The Night of the Living Dance.  Come on, let's get you there.  Fine. Whatever. I don't care.  Thattagirl.  (honks)  (honks)    Wow, even Frond put on zombie makeup.  - No, I didn't. - Oh.  - You're gonna be fine. - Oh, look, Tina.  There's Jimmy Jr. Looking pretty dapper  for an undead guy, huh?  Hi, Tina. I just want to say,  I, um I didn't ask you to the dance  because I was too embarrassed to tell you.  I pulled my butt muscle doing a very difficult move  from Save the Last Dance.  There. I said it. (sighs)  It feels good not to hide my butt stuff anymore.  (quietly): This is bad. Jimmy Jr. is talking about his butt,  and Tina's too busy being on Planet Goose to notice.  Anyway, I can't really dance,  but I'd like to try.  With you.  Gene, help me make her dance.  - Ow. Ow. Ow. - (grunting)  - Ow. - (honks)  - (gasps) - Oh, my God! - What the  -(hissing) -Bruce! -(Tammy screams)  TAMMY: Goose on the loose!  (shouting)  - Get out of here! - Don't!  - You're scaring him! - (hissing)  Oh, no! He's stuck!  That goose is hooked!  He's stuck! My friendship bracelet is hooked on something.  Why the heck is there a goose in here?  If you have to ask, then you don't get it.  - I-I'm-I'm gonna call Animal Control. - What? No!  Yes. No goose is gonna ruin a dance I'm chaperoning.  But what-what'll happen to Bruce?  I don't know, Tina.  I didn't go to Animal Control School.  I went to Harvard ton Community College.  - (whirring) - (bell jingles, door closes)  (sheepishly): Hey, Gretchen.  This is the one I was telling you about.  - Mm-hmm. - Gretchen, listen  I can't hear you. I'm blow-drying!  - I'm gonna say it anyway! - (whirring increases in volume)  I'm sorry I tried to make you into someone you're not.  It's just 'cause I love you and I want you to be happy.  But I realized you're happy the way you are.  And I have the perfect wedding date for you.  - Oh, yeah? Who? - (whirring stops)  - Me. - You?  Yeah! I'm nice but I'm not boring.  And I-I like to drink.  - A lot. - Mm-hmm.  Will you let me take you to your sister's wedding?  Mm Okay!  All right!  Should we get a limo?  Yeah, let's get a limo!  Let's get a limo!  - (honking) - Animal Control will be here shortly.  Bruce, I'm gonna climb up the bleachers and get you down!  Oh, no, you are not! I'm not adding a broken neck  to my list of problems tonight.  First, the DJ didn't have any Tiffany songs,  - and then this goose - Jimmy Jr.!  Get down from there!  Ow. My butt. My butt.  J-Ju, what a beautiful sacrifice.  - (hisses) - (shouts)  Stop biting me, goose!  He's just scared! Bruce, listen to me.  Honk, honk! Honk, honk, honk!  What's happening?  I don't know!  - Oh, my God, is it working? - (hissing)  Oh, no. It's biting him more than before.  He's bleeding.  So, I'm just gonna reach in!  - (hisses) - (screams)  - Bruce! You're okay! - (honks)  Jimmy Jr., you saved him.  Yeah. You, uh, seemed really upset, so  - Mwah. - Oh. Wow.  So, is your butt okay?  (groans) It really hurts.  Should I take a look at it or  Oh, I-I don't know.  I guess I should probably just go to the doctor.  Right, right, right.  Bruce, we shared a lot of great times together.  A lot of laughs and even a few tears.  And one kiss that I don't really want to talk about.  But this relationship can't last.  Listen, sometimes loving our own species can be painful.  But maybe it's worth it because it can also be amazing.  Come on, Tina. Finish dumping your goose  so he can find someone new.  What about that one?  No, I know that duck. Total diva.  What about those swans?  They're so cliquey, Dad.  (gasps) Bruce,  over there. Hot goose.  Let's see if you two get along.  Oh, wow. You get along really well.  Slow down, guys. You don't even know each other.  All right, let's go. I got to get home  for my big date with Gretchen.  I'm glad you're getting back out there, Mom.  Hey, Dad, maybe we can find you a park animal.  I like that weird duck over there.  Who wouldn't?  Bah-bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-bah Bruce   Bah-bah-bah, bah-bah Bruce the Goose   Bah-bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-bah Bruce   Bah-bah-bah, bah-bah Bruce the Goose   Kinda clingy, Bruce the Goose   Tellin' stories to Bruce the Goose   Friends forever, Bruce the Goose   Secret kiss with Bruce the Goose   Ooh   Bah-bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-bah Bru"
"1  Gene, Tina, hurry up.  Those eggs aren't gonna eat themselves.  But they will eat this bacon. Eat it. Eat it!  I'm leaving for school in three minutes  with or without you, and I'm the only one  - who knows the way. - We know the way.  You turn left where that cloud looks like a dolphin.  Louise, what's the big rush to get to school?  Because I only get to be principal for one day,  and I don't want to miss a minute of it.  Oh, yeah, your big prize.  For selling the most candy bars in that school thing.  My little Glengarry Glen Louise.  I busted my ass hawking that choc.  And possibly broke some laws.  Four bucks for a candy bar?  I can get you onto Sweet Street for three.  Instead of a dumb tip for my mom,  how about some chocolate for your mom?  Chocolate bars! Get your chocolate bars!  Very unofficial treat of the Wonderdogs.  Hello. Bye!  Wait a minute. You sold me so many.  And I'm beginning to think there never was a golden ticket.  So, sweetie, what are you gonna do as principal?  Oh, you know, abuse my power  - to the fullest extent. - Cool.  But my number-one goal? The Cabinet of Confiscation.  What's the Cabinet of Confiscation?  It's a year's worth of priceless loot confiscated from students.  All in one place: Principal Spoors' office.  The fidget spinners alone are worth millions.  We're talking inappropriate comic books,  fireworks, fake vomit.  That's my favorite kind of vomit.  Um, Louise, I guess something else  you could get out of being principal  is learning about, you know, leadership and responsibility.  Oh.  Uh, yeah, I agree. Good stuff, Bob.  Uh, I'm the good parent. Everyone remember that.  Let's roll! I'm driving.  Morning, Ms. Schnur.  Coffee, two sugars. Actually, seven sugars.  You know what? Just make it sugar.  - Excuse me? - We're about to dive into  my First Hundred Minutes agenda,  so you may want to hit the bathroom before we start.  First off, I only go at home.  Kids aren't the only ones who have trouble going at school.  Second, I don't work for you, Louise.  How about a little less chitchat, babe?  - Weird. - There she is.  Principal for a Day.  Uh, why is my door locked?  - Your door? - Principal?  You know you're not really principal, right?  - It's a ceremonial role. - Ceremonial?  You get to supervise the flag-raising,  water the school plant,  phone in today's attendance to the district.  That's a fun voice mail to leave.  Ordinarily, Principal Spoors  would walk you through your day,  but he's attending a leadership conference.  Leadership.  - Wha ? - Nothing.  All right. Let's get this crap show on the road.  I've got counseling to do.  I'm breaking in a new therapy doll:  Online Shamin' Damon.  Whew! What a full day of being principal.  It's only 9:15. I haven't done anything yet.  You still have the flag-lowering at 3:00,  so get your backpack and go be  a regular below-average student for six hours.  What a rip-off!  Ms. Schnur, do you have a bobby pin I can borrow?  Like, this one?  I could probably spare that one.  Ooh, that's a nice paper clip.  - You've got taste, lady. - Thank you.  Ms. Schnur, your nephew Has he done anything lately?  Nathan? Oh, my God.  - Where to begin? - Just begin.  He got into magic camp, this kid.  - Mmm. - Not the sleepover one.  Uh, he's got some issues, but  Hi, Teddy.  Why are you, um  Do you  do you need something?  No, uh, just watching.  Sometimes I pretend this cutout is a TV screen  and I'm watching a cooking show called Mustache Kitchen.  - Ooh, I'd watch that. - Uh  I mean, they're-they're hit or miss,  but this episode's pretty good.  Bob's flipping burgers, moving stuff around.  -Oh, my God. -Where'd you learn your spatula technique?  I mean, is it all in the wrist? Your delicate wrists?  Or the forearm? How do you do it?  I-I don't know. I mean, I don't really, uh, think about it.  I just, uh, do it, I think.  Oops. Huh.  - Huh  - Huh, that's-that's weird.  All right, um, this next flip will be fine.  Oh, crap, I broke that one in half.  Bob, what's going on?  - What'd you do to those burgers? - I don't know.  I was fine, then Teddy started asking me  stupid questions and got me  - Not stupid. - Thinking about it,  and now I can't flip a burger.  No, no, no, Teddy. Don't ask Bob questions.  His brain's not built for that.  When I met him, he could tie a tie.  Then I asked him to show me how,  and he couldn't tie a tie for five years.  Boy, this is a really interesting Mustache Kitchen.  And then last month, Nathan entered  the New Yorker caption contest  - Uh-huh, yeah. - And was robbed,  in my opinion and everyone's opinion.  - Cabinet of Confiscation. - The winning one  - was not even good. - Combination lock? No!  What are you doing in here?  I'm being the fricking principal.  But you're not, though.  My God, Spoors' private bathroom.  I've never seen the inside.  Spoors doesn't share his bathroom  with his poor secretary with the shy bladder?  It's not my bladder. But no, he doesn't.  Ms. Schnur, I'm here. You're here.  The bathroom is here. And Principal Spoors isn't.  So why don't you tell me the combination to that lock?  - Only Spoors knows it. - Ugh! All right.  Pivoting to the rest of my agenda.  Ah. I would like some blank  ""from the office of the principal"" letterhead.  - Oh. - Mm-hmm.  How about you enjoy some time in the private bathroom  while I enjoy some time cranking out some very official memos.  Everybody wins.  The toilet loses.  There's a stack of letterhead in that drawer.  Looks like we've both got some work to do.  See you on the other side  Principal Louise.  Check it out, peeps. New class schedule.  Straight from the principal's office.  Double recess? No more study hall?  How do you like our educational system now, Norway?  And double lunch. Now I can chew my food like I'm supposed to.  Wow. Louise is actually doing it.  If she's really gonna be the principal,  I'm gonna be the prance-able.  Now I can drive Uber for 15 minutes instead of ten.  Wh-What's all the hubbub?  Louise can't do this.  It's ""from the office of the principal.""  It looks official, right?  If we want it to, which we do.  She's gone rogue.  - No prancing in the hall! - Ah, boo.  Bob, we're getting  a little behind here.  This one guy's been waiting.  I'm running out of excuses, so I told him  our regular chef is away and you're his dumb twin.  I'm doing my best, Lin.  Damn it!  Bob, I-I think I know what this is.  - You've got the yips. - Yips? What are yips?  They're a mental block that pro athletes get.  Like that baseball catcher who got so in his head,  he couldn't even throw the ball back to the pitcher.  He had to walk it back while everyone booed.  Flip yips!  Flipping burgers is literally the only thing I'm good at.  Teddy, what do those sports guys with the yips do to get better?  Oh, there's all kinds of therapies.  They change their grip, do breathing exercises,  hypnosis, but mostly they retire in shame  'cause none of that stuff works.  Oh, crap.  Ah  I just came over here for some peace and quiet.  My restaurant's packed and loud. Zoom!  - Go away, Jimmy. - Yeah, go away. It's a bad time.  So, like, uh, every day?  Nothing's going on with Bob, that's for sure.  Oh, yeah, Bob looks sweatier than usual.  What, is he having a baby back there?  - Bob's got the yips, Jimmy. - Lin, stop.  He can't flip a burger, but we still love him.  Bob's got yips!  Like that, uh, catcher I used to boo. Hilarious.  -Can I get a burger? -Ooh, geez. I don't know. Can he, Bob?  Hey, yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip!  Yeah, you have the go-ahead.  You can start building the pool right away.  And we're gonna go with three crazy slides.  I don't want sane slides.  Okay, Principal Louise. Fun's over.  Uh, my office hours aren't till this afternoon, Phillip.  Oh, I guess I could come back  No!  What am I saying? Get out of that chair.  Why don't you have a lollipop and we'll talk this over.  Talking it over, no. Lollipop, yes.  Well, I'm not budging from this seat, so  Just roll with it, Louise.  Damn it. This is lime, not sour apple.  You're not supposed to go in that bathroom.  - How was it? - Paradise.  Where's Principal Louise?  There is no Principal Louise.  Attention, faculty and students.  This is Principal Louise. Recess is now tripled.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Louise, what if  - we turn PE into - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.  Oh, and PE will now be sensual reggae dance hour.  Mm!  Ooh, Louise, can it be Wacky Hat Day?  Oh, it's just that, Gene, where are people supposed  to get hats on short notice?  Please give me this!  - It's Wacky Hat Day. - Yes!  - Louise, Mr. Frond is coming. - Also, Mr. Frond has hidden  a five-dollar bill in his shoe.  First student to get it out of there can take it home!  - I don't have money in my shoes! - Give it to me!  She's getting away!  New policy. Henceforth, all teachers have to speak  ""Have to speak with an Italian accent."" Cool.  ""Passing notes is allowed."" Nice. That's my medium.  ""Gum chewing is now a class."" Oh, my God, I might graduate.  First lunch is over.  Second lunch begins. Bon appetoots!    Attention! All tetherballs  shall be untethered  - and set free! - It's chaos.    I'm Tammy, and I'm here with Louise,  our popular Principal for a Day.  I'm also popular. Did you think I would ever talk to you?  Of course I hoped not, Tammy, but I'm everyone's principal.  Hmm. Jocelyn is in the hall,  getting some reactions to your day.  I'm passing some of my best notes.  Yeah, Zeke's on fire. Highly quotable.  Wacky Hat Day has been a huge success,  despite what you might have heard!  The scores on the quiz I gave today  were the highest of the year.  I think the extra recess really helped the kids focus.  - What did I get? - Let's talk off the air.  Oh.  The news studio.  You can't go in there. The light is on.  Ah! I've got you! I  Where's Louise? She was just on TV.  She left already. We're not live.  We're, like, on a delay, in case kids swear.  - Damn it! - Yeah, like that.  You know what, Schnur?  I kind of got into this principal thing for myself,  but I feel like I'm actually helping people? Is that crazy?  The amount you have done in one day.  - And the amount you've done. - Thank you.  Hey-oh. Looking for Principal Spoors.  - You're not him. - No, I am not.  I know that because you're a kid.  And because Principal Spoors is my brother-in-law.  - Who is that? - I'm Don, the new guidance counselor.  But we already have a guidance counselor, Mr. Frond.  Yeah, that's probably the guy getting fired  so I can have his job.  Mr. Frond's getting fired?  Am I dreaming?  You're real, right?  - Oh, I try to keep it real. - Yeah, you do.  So you're Principal Spoors' brother-in-law?  Yeah. He married my sister. Or I married his sister.  Anyway, one of those sisters nagged him into giving me a job.  Oy, Spoors always picks days he's out for people to be fired.  Then he makes me do it. Wimp.  You're gonna fire Mr. Frond right now?  Can, uh, I watch?  First, Mr. Frond has to give Don his orientation.  The fired person orients the hired person  before they know they're fired.  You get a much better orienting that way.  Yeah, I can see that.  Hi, Mr. Frond.  This is Don.  He is joining our counseling department,  and that's all I'm gonna say about that for now.  Finally, some help around here.  I've been begging Principal Spoors for months.  Yo-boy.  Okay, I'm gonna have to orient you quickly, Don,  because I'm dealing with a bit of an emergency today.  Any questions before we get started?  Yes. Should I be paying attention,  or is it enough if I nod every now and then  like I'm getting it?  - Um, pay attention? - Mm-hmm.  Look at him. Mr. Frond has no idea what's going on.  He's orienting his own executioner.  Like the old Domino's Pizza crust  teaching the new Domino's Pizza crust how to be crusty.  So now's our chance to bust  the Cabinet of Confiscation wide open.  Forget combinations. We need overwhelming force.  Ah, Mr. Branca. Do you have a crowbar we could borrow?  A personal crowbar or a work crowbar?  Beware, my personal crowbar is haunted.  Okay, your work crowbar, then.  Oh, I got that one downstairs.  - Can we go get it? - No, it's here.  ""Downstairs"" is what I call my pants.  Crap!  Stupid! No, no!  Can I interest you in the Burger of the Day?  - Oh, double crap! - It's  fries.  Wait! I did it!  Lin! I figured it out! Come see!  - Oh, thank God. - Yay, Bobby!  It's just a little bit different.  I slide the spatula under the burger like normal.  Sure, right.  Then I bring in the second spatula.  Second spatula?  And I kind of push it from one to the other.  Then I rest for a sec. Whew.  Then I turn the handle of both spatulas  Delicate  Ta-da! Well? What do you think?  It makes me feel  sorry for you?  It's kind of the burger-man equivalent  of walking the ball back to the pitcher, right?  -You think I don't know that, Teddy?! -Aah!  Something's wrong with my brain!  It's a very simple task, and I'm not even close.  I'm broken! And you did this!  You did this, Teddy!  Bob, Bob, Bob, hey.  - Easy. Come here. - Oh! Hold me!  There, there. There he is. Ow! Ow!  Easy with those spatulas!  It's slow, but I think we're getting there.  That's the name of my one-man show.  So how about I take all the truly messed-up kids  and you tackle Peter Pescadero?  He's got a weird belly button,  and about every three weeks or so, a kid sees it.  I don't know. My belly button's perfect,  and he might sense that.  Ms. Schnur will take your picture for your I.D. card.  And that completes your orientation.  Oy. So, Mr. Frond  What's that?  Louise! The Cabinet of Confiscation!  - Mr. Branca's work crowbar! - Did you do it?  Not yet. I was just in my windup.  - Do what? - Aw, you poor, poor man.  Poor me? Poor you!  All right, I'm just gonna say it.  Don is here to replace you.  Nice try. Don is completely unqualified.  That's not what my mom says.  Damn it, I meant to say ""your mom.""  Mr. Frond, Ms. Schnur's gonna ask you to take a walk with her.  No, she's not.  Let's take a little walk, Mr. Frond.  Seriously?  That's how I feel any time I have to walk anywhere.  - But I love my job. - Ew.  Fine.  Make sure Eli gets his placebo Ritalin.  It's, uh, a raisin.  If Jessica gets ragey before lunch,  it's just low blood sugar. Give her a raisin.  Mr. Frond will be okay, right?  He could probably do with some time off.  And Don, he's gonna work out great for us  as a guidance counselor.  He's dumb, and he doesn't give a crap.  Unlike Mr. Phillip ""Cares Too Much"" Frond.  I've never heard his full name.  - It's pretty. - He's always busting his butt,  doing his best to actually counsel kids,  the big, dopey son of a  I don't feel as great  about this as I want to.  Whew. I'm glad to hear you say that.  It's kind of what I was feeling, but you're the principal,  and I guess I'm intimidated by authority.  I was totally on the same page, too.  Uh, glad you both finally came around.  Huh, something's written on a piece of tape  on the back of this lock.  ""One, one, one, one.""  He wrote the combination on the back of the lock?  And we never turned the lock over?  And he couldn't remember ""one, one, one, one""?  It's everything we ever dreamed of.  - Whoopee cushions. - Cans of Jolt.  Rubber snake. Oh, no, that's a dead real one.  Guys, listen.  We can either have the best afternoon of our lives  playing with this stuff, or we can save Frond's job  while I'm still principal. There's not time to do both.  Can I at least make the dead snake  - sit on the whoopee cushion? - All right, real quick.  Okay, let's go.  Principal Spoors comes back tomorrow.  So we've only got to the end of the day to make Don gone.  It's almost 2:00. There's no time to waste.  Wait. Wasting time. That gives me an idea.  What's the biggest time waster of all at school?  That thing I do where I take all my pencils to the bathroom  and give them each a little bath?  No, assemblies.  As principal, I'll call a special assembly  to give Frond a fond farewell.  A Frond-well, for short.  And to welcome the new guidance counselor.  Oh, my God, that sounds like  just a super thoughtful thing to do?  It won't be thoughtful.  But it will be super.  Okay, sounding more ominous now, the way you said it.  Bob, Linda! I think I got it!  - What? What, Teddy? - All Bob can think of  is how he's gonna mess up the burger.  So he does! He needs something else to fill his brain.  Like that baseball movie with Kevin Costner.  - Oh, yeah, Bill Durham. - Bull.  Don't say that till you hear the idea, Bob.  No. The mo  the char  Forget it.  So, not Bill Durham, but the other guy, the pitcher,  was crazy wild.  So to take his mind off it,  that lady gave him her underwear.  Bob's not wearing my underwear.  I got them stretched out just the way I like them.  No, no. You don't have to wear Linda's underwear.  -Okay. -I'm talking about Jimmy's Pesto's.  Oh, my God. Wait. How did you get those?  I bribed his bartender Trev to sneak them out  of Jimmy's gym bag.  Now I got to build Trev a pretty intricate doghouse.  Well, I'm not wearing those, either.  Bob, you gotta try.  Put that Pesto in your pants. It's our only hope.  Are they clean?  They are not.  Hi. Acting Principal Louise here.  You're welcome. As you may have heard,  Mr. Frond is leaving the school he's been at forever.  He's the pest in the vest who's always distressed.  He's Mr. Frond. A few words?  Uh, I'm disappointed but undaunted.  So, tomorrow, I get up, get dressed,  blank space, blank space, go to bed early.  Oh, my God, I have no idea what to do.  Except keep it from Mother.  - Hot mic, Mr. F.! - Huh? Oh, yes.  I-I'm gonna go pack up my office.  That zen garden isn't gonna travel well.  Now let's meet our new guidance counselor.  Don. Where do you guys go to school?  Oh. Here. Right.  Jokes. Thank you. Good night.  Don, since you're up here, maybe you could take  a few counseling questions from students?  Oh, I don't think anybody wants to, uh, hear  - We got one here, Don. - Okay.  My hamster got killed by our Roomba,  and I'm having trouble moving on.  Young girl's first experience with death. Don?  Uh  I'll have to come back to that, I think.  Young man here has a question about puberty.  Ever since I started getting hair on my  You know what? Let's go back to the, uh, hamster girl.  I have one over here, Don.  A friend of mine is asthmatic,  and his parents are divorced.  He's wondering if maybe it's the asthma's fault?  - Uh  yeah, maybe. - What?  My brothers are twins, but there's only one of me,  and it feels like a rip-off. Where's my twin, Don?  Where's my twin?  I'm right here, Jay-Ju. I got you.  You don't look like me!  Not a criteria for friendship. I get it.  Can I  can I get a glass of some water, please?  We're a school, not a five-star restaurant, Don.  He was lying there with his little legs in the air.  Just like when I found Grandpa.  Why does everything die?  You know, I think  mic  cut out  Uh, no. Mic's working fine for me.  All right, Don, answer the questions.  How's banana hands doing? Zoom!  Show's over, Jimmy. Bob got yip therapy.  Yeah, right.  No, Jimmy, I'm back.  Square in the middle of the grill.  - That's my Bobby. - Fluke.  Fluke you, Jimmy. Bob's all better.  - And it's thanks to you, pal. - Thanks to me.  You helped me in a very intimate way.  Don't say ""intimate."" Come on.  You eating? It's on me.  The burgers are on me.  I'm not talking about something else being on me.  But I  could.  You know, you're being weird.  If I wanted weird, I'd listen to Trev  talk about some crazy doghouse he's getting.  I've enjoyed our brief time, Jimmy.  Go back to underwear you came from.  Stop saying things I-I don't get.  I'm leaving. Have fun with your stupid words.  Bye.  Hey, Bob. Any way I could get a turn in those things?  I got to fix a roof tomorrow.  I could use any help I could get.  - Mmm - Aw, Bob, let Teddy wear 'em.  He's gonna do a roof.  All right. But I want them back.  - You're the one who copies me. - You copy me, Jocelyn.  Sorry. Who had brown hair until she met me  -and now she's blonde? -I'd have to look at you to copy you.  -I don't even like to look at you. Whatever. -Whatever.  Best friends in crisis. Don?  I  I left  an ice cream cake in my trunk.  All right. It's not a friend.  It's me.  Good assembly. Did Peter Pescadero confess to a crime?  Ah. Don just quit.  Says a tree fell on him.  - Aw. - Great, great.  Now let's find Mr. Frond.  He left the assembly early. Come on.  - Mr. Frond, stop. - Not now, Louise.  I just want to go home and get in the bath with my cats.  We've got a major situation.  - Don quit. - What? He did?  So the school needs a guidance counselor.  I'm only gonna be principal for three more minutes.  I want the last thing I do to be hiring you back.  You have no authority to offer me a job, Louise.  - Hmm, in that case - I accept. Thank God.  Good negotiation.  Maybe you should've asked for a better parking place?  Come on. Let's move you back into your office.  It's a good thing you didn't grab all your stuff yet.  - This is all my stuff. - Oh.  You know, Louise, as a principal today,  you were actually pretty good.  Thanks, Mr. Frond.  You're pretty good. For noticing that.  Whoops! It's fine. Don't look.  I'm doin' a dance   'Cause I got Pesto in my pants   -  Ah, ah  -  I'm doin' a dance   'Cause I got Pesto in my pants   Ah, ah   My burgers would not flip   My spatula had yips   But now I have no more care   In tight Italian underwear   -  I'm doin' a dance  -  He's doin' a dance   - 'Cause I got Pesto in my pants  - Give it up   -  Give it up, give it up  -  I'm doin' a dance."
"1  LINDA: All right!  (singsongy): It's Friday.  When you think about it, today is the week's butt.  And Dad has a weak butt.  Dad? Talking about your butt? No?  Dad, please pay attention when we're sassing you.  Oh. Uh, thank you.  Okay, kids. Better get to school.  Bob, hello?  Aren't you gonna say bye to the kids?  Oh, right. Uh, bye.  Uh, thanks for coming in.  - He said lovingly. - Bob.  - Hmm? - Are you okay?  You just told the kids goodbye  like they were customers leaving the restaurant.  Huh. I must be a little tired.  Well, drink some more coffee, mister.  I've already had three cups.  My heart is going like a little hummingbird. I like it.  It's like a little drum circle in my chest.  Bum! Ba-bum-bum-bum.  Ba-bum-bum-bum. Ba-bum-bum-bum.  TEDDY: So, turns out,  it's not shingles. I just have gross skin on my back.  - Hmm. - That's great, Teddy.  Hey, hey, Bob, can you top me off?  Bob. Bob!  You're pouring ketchup in my coffee.  Oh, my God. Oh, sorry.  Geez. I mean, it might taste good.  No, that's Ugh, that is gross.  (groaning)  Wait, let me try it again.  Ugh. No.  Eh. Why'd I do that? Ugh.  Unless  - No. No. No, no, no. - Teddy, stop.  What's going on with you today, Bob?  You're totally out of it.  I-I'm fine. It-It's just, um  What, uh, what was everyone talking about?  - Teddy's nasty back skin. - Oh.  I think I'll go back in the kitchen. Bye-bye.  - What's his deal? - I don't know. He's  (gasps) Oh, no!  -What? -He might be getting his burnout.  - Remember? - Oh, no.  Not the burnout. The last one was so weird.  (high-pitched): It's fine. It's fine.  It's fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.  Hey, Bob.  - (normal voice): Hi, Leslie! - (screams)  Now that I think about it, he hasn't had a day off  - since Easter. - Have you?  Yeah, yeah, I sneak 'em in.  Last weekend I took Gene to the mall  to visit an outfit he likes.  Sheesh. I'm worried, Linda. I'm worried.  Okay, okay, don't panic.  I'll keep an eye on him today, see how it goes.  Perfect.  Hi. How was school?  We had a spelling test, and I think I did B-A-D-D.  BOB: Okay, okay, okay, okay,  okay, okay, okay, okay.  Um, who's Dad talking to back there?  Your dad's just having an interesting day.  ""You're acting weird.""  No, you're acting weird.  ""You just put mustard on me.  I'm not supposed to have mustard.""  I know what you have on you. I invented you.  (high-pitched screaming)  ""Here we go.""  Uh, I'll just go back there and check on him.  Now I'm gonna put tons of mustard on you!  What do you think about that?!  - Whoa. - Yeah, he's got the burnout.  I'm sorry.  We got to get him to take the day off tomorrow.  Let's kiss. Just a little kiss.  And I think I know what we should do.  Poison him.  Linda?  Lin?  Kids?  Hello?  What are you guys doing down here so early?  The-the door's locked.  Guys, seriously, open the door.  I'm afraid not, Bob.  This is your outer-vention.  What?!  You got to stay out of the restaurant today.  You're getting a day off whether you like it or not.  No!  - Let me in. - No! You need a day off.  - Kids, open the door. - Get out of here, Dad.  We don't want you. Go on, get.  Until tonight. Please come back tonight.  Fine. I'll just go get the extra keys.  - No! - We're setting you free, Dad.  Go! Run with the other men.  We are not letting you in.  You have to go have fun. Do something relaxing.  Never!  (gasps) The back. Kids, go.  (panting)  No, no, no, no, no! No!  Let me work!  No way, mister.  There's a bun delivery today, Lin.  I-I need to be here to check if they're all okay.  We've got your buns covered, Dad.  Let me in and I promise I'll take the day off tomorrow.  LINDA: No! This is for your own good!  I'll just keep pounding, then.  You'll never get rid of me.  -  - I'm still here.  (vehicle approaching)  Mr. Fischoeder. He'll have keys.  Uh, Mr. Fischoeder! Wait!  (Bob panting)  M-Mr. Fischoeder.  Uh, thank you for stopping  so, so far away from when you first heard me yelling.  Bob, what are you doing running after me like a crazy person?  Oh, I-I need, uh, keys to the restaurant.  - Linda won't let me in. - Oh.  Well, we all knew this day would come. Good for her.  No, no, no. I-It's not that. It's just I want to work,  and she's forcing me to take the day off.  You want to work? At that restaurant?  Uh, yes.  Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob. Get in.  I've got something I want to show you.  Wait, hold on. First let me put down a Wee-Wee Pad.  Linda.  Oh, hi, Mudflap. How are you?  I'm great. Family's great.  Got my back tattoo removed. Put it on my front.  - I hear that. - Can I get you something to eat?  Actually, I was wondering  if I could have a surprise baby shower here.  - It's for my friend Goldie. - Aw!  Goldie's in a different gang, the Easy Beavers.  Anyway, she deserves a great shower,  and this is the only nice restaurant I know.  So, what do you think?  Of course. When is it gonna be?  - Like, in an hour. - Today?!  That's what I put on the Evites.  Today is soon, but we can handle it.  Right, kids? You want to help put a baby shower together  - in an hour or what? - Or what.  I'll call all the babies I know  and tell them to get their asses over here.  And I'll call all the asses I know  and tell them to get their babies over here.  Oh, here's a bunch of money that is definitely not stolen  to help cover the food and whatnot.  All right.  Go, go, shower rangers.  Um, what's this for?  It's for rolling, Bob. You roll them down the hill  and see if a car runs them over.  Right. Uh, but why?  B-Because it's fun, Bob.  Try it.  (laughs) See?  (chuckles): It seems like a waste of food, honestly.  Exactly. Waste of food. Waste of time. You get it.  Doing nothing, Bob, is really doing something.  That literally makes no sense.  Maybe you could just give me the keys and  Bob, Bob, Bob, you're not listening.  There are times in my life   When I've had to do something   Hiring, firing, illegal trash dumping   But any time that I have had something to do   I always wished that I could   Bid that something adieu   Nothing, nothing, nothing makes me happy   Doing something is what I avoid   I adore diddly-squat   It thrills me a lot   And nothing never gets me annoyed   Oh, sometimes I have to do stuff, and I hate it   Like paying off arsonists, showering and shaving   Wait, did you just say ""paying off arsonists""?  No, I said, uh, playing golf with pharmacists.  Huh. Where was I? Oh.  Nothing, nothing, nothing makes me happy, happy, happy   Nothing brings me nothing but joy   So if you haven't tried nada   I really think you oughta   'Cause all play and no work   Makes me   A big, sexy boy   Big old sexy boy.   Are you starting to get it now, Bob?  Maybe. I mean, I guess you are a big, sexy boy, but  - Well, of course I am. - Yeah.  Now let's go do nothing somewhere else.  Okay, I made a bunch of sliders.  It's like baby hamburgers, so it's perfect.  - (door opens, bell jingles) - LOUISE: Okay, Mom.  I looked for dolls for the diaper relay.  Found a couple of Tina's old ones,  and then I got this butternut squash,  Gene's pillow  and a Halloween skeleton that plays guitar.  Great. Tina, are you done mushing up stuff  for the baby food guessing game?  Yep. I mushed my tush off.  - Here she comes. - Oh!  Everybody hide. Hide!  ALL: Surprise!  Oh, God! What the hell is this?  It's your baby shower.  (crying): Oh, God, no. No.  - No, no, no, no. - Are those happy tears?  I do not think so, Linda.  Felix. Grover.  Bob, this is Grover Fischoeder.  He's our cousin and our lawyer.  Oh. Uh, what-what is this place?  Um, it is a private social club  that is well within its rights  to host any number of animal strength contests.  - Snail wrestling, Bob. - I'm sorry, what?  - Snail wrestling. - Uh, if you're joining us,  I will need you to sign a waiver.  Have you ever had diphtheria or Snail Tail?  - Um, neither. - What do you say, Bob?  Care to snail?  It's not nothing, but it's damn close.  And it's just a thousand-dollar buy-in.  Uh, you know what, Mr. Fischoeder,  I'm gonna take what you said to heart.  I'm gonna go try to enjoy my life.  Have fun with your snails.  (chuckling nervously): What snails? Uh, no snails here.  No.  How dare you? Shame on you.  - Goldie, what's going on? - (crying): What do you mean?  Well, you walked into your baby shower,  we all yelled ""surprise,""  and then you started crying tears  of genuine emotional sadness.  I did not! You take that back.  Okay, okay.  - So, you're not sad? - Who's this?  That's Linda. I had my baby in her restaurant.  This restaurant right here.  Right there in that booth, actually.  Nah. I'm gonna call her Two Boobs.  All right. So, do you want to go ahead  with this party that we've been planning for months?  (chuckles): Yeah, sure. Uh, you know,  I-I love to party. Hell, yeah.  But no having your baby in the booth. One was enough.  Copy that, Two Boobs.  Wow, maybe this is nice,  taking a day off.  My buns.  I-I'll just pop in  and give them a quick touch and sniff.  - (sniffs) - (door closes)  (vocalizing)  BOB: Wait! Aah!  - Gah! - Uh-oh, Joel.  Looks like you've got another bread perv.  No, I Wait. Wait, wh-what's a bread perv?  You know, one of those guys who's into bread.  I mean, really into bread.  He's not a bread perv. That's Bob.  - I know him. He's a customer. - Just because you know him  -doesn't mean he's not a bread perv. -Oh, true.  - Wait, bread pervs are real? - Too real.  Bob, what were you doing to these rolls?  I-I-I was, uh  smelling them and, um, touching them.  - Bread perv. - Through the plastic.  Look, I missed my bread delivery today  because my wife made me take a day off from my restaurant,  and so I was seeing if mine were in here  so I could just check them out.  I already dropped your buns off, Bob.  Oh, man. If someone forced me to take the day off,  there'd be no one here.  So you run this place all by yourself?  Patricia's 77 Sandwiches?  I got to get out of here. That guy headed this way is  -an actual bread perv. -Oh, here, let me get that other one.  -Oh. Thanks. -Okay, that's all of it. I got to go.  (chuckles) Hey, what do you guys have there?  -Italian loaf? -Stay back! - Get out of here!  - Ciabatta? - Get away from my bread!  Do you really make all 77 sandwiches?  Oh, no. I make 34.  That's why I call it Patricia's 77 Sandwiches.  - Can I try one? - Sure. What can I make you?  Uh, I guess I'll have, uh, number 47.  It's the turkey  Turkey, onions, dill cream cheese,  cucumber, roasted peppers,  and hummus on a black pepper roll.  Wow. You have all 77 memorized?  Course I have them memorized.  I can barely remember all my kids' names.  You have kids? I didn't know bread could reproduce.  - Go! Go! Go! Go! - Done!  Two Boobs, check me.  Diaper is on the face.  No winner.  Check it again, woman.  I mean, uh, I mean, yay! Great job!  Uh, Goldie, you win. Yay!  All right, all right! (whoops)  That's more like it!  - (grunting) - Oh, no, what's wrong?  Are you going into labor?  No. Course not. Uh, this little passenger  in my baby carriage is just giving me  pretty fierce bottom ramen, you know?  Wha ? Wha-Wha-What's she saying?  It's biker for ""diarrhea.""  Oh. Uh, there's the bathroom.  Someone's in there Not doing drugs.  Oh. Okay, okay. Uh, go to the employee bathroom.  - Gene, show her where. - Right this way, milady.  Ooh, let's waddle along. (chuckles)  Mmm. Wow. This is really good.  - Uh, Patricia. Patricia. - One sec, Bob.  - This sandwich is really good. - What's that?  - I said this sandwich was - Um, excuse me, miss?  - Right with you. - Can I get some more napkins?  - Uh, hey-hey, Patricia? - Uh, kind of busy, Bob.  - Is my to-go ready? - Uh-huh. Yep.  Patricia, you're slammed. Let me help you.  What? No, that's crazy.  It's crazy not to let me help you. Please.  - Okay, fine. - Yes! Give me an apron.  -I'm ready to work. -Now you're making me regret this.  You're too excited, and it's freaking me out.  Sorry. Sorry. I-I'll be cool.  (giggles)  -Oh, hey, Steve. You're a little bit early. -Yeah.  I thought I'd try the number 39 while I wait for a big date.  Okay, so, a, a number 39 for Steve.  Yeah. I'm officially halfway today.  I've been working my way through the menu.  Wow. So you've been here 39 times?  Yep. I do like the sandwiches, but, uh,  I mainly kept coming back 'cause I wanted to ask her out.  -It took a while. -Had to make sure you weren't weird.  Oh, I'm weird. Look. This finger is too short.  That's your thumb.  Is it? Then what's this?  - I Oh, my God, I don't know. - I don't know, either.  - So, where are you taking me? - I thought we could go ride  the Ferris wheel after the lunch rush.  I am not riding that death trap. No.  No one has died on it in at least a year-ish.  I think someone fell off and broke their leg last week,  - but I-I won't tell her. - (quietly): Thanks.    (clears throat): Well, you might want to just seal that puppy off  for a couple of years, Two Boobs.  Who's ready for the baby food eating contest?  Okay, Tina, it's your time to shine.  In these cups are three different mashed  (pained groaning): No !  Uh-oh. Diarrhea's back.  Nope. I was lying about the diarrhea.  I mean, not lying. It's a whole bunch of things.  But I've also been having contractions  for the past 24 hou rs !  - Oh, my God! - Uh, Goldie, Linda,  I'm kind of in the middle of my speech.  Goldie, why didn't you tell anyone you were labor?  (grunting): Because I'm not ready to have this baby!  That's why I was crying earlier. I'm freaking out!  Oh, this was all a mistake!  I don't want to be a mom!  -(loud grunting) -Goldie, Goldie, Goldie, calm down.  Hey! You see these three kids right here?  They all came out of me, and let me tell you something, sister.  - (groans): Yeah? - I was not ready for 'em.  - (grunting) - Look, I get it.  You got a tiny stranger coming out of your vagina  who's going to annoy you for the rest of your life.  But they'll also be the thing you're proudest of.  -We're a damn treat. -I don't even wear diapers anymore.  Brag!  I wasn't ready for Sidecar,  but I birthed him right here in this booth,  and now I would die for that kid.  (grunting): Okay, okay, so you're saying  I don't have to be ready for the baby?  It's all just super easy?  - (screaming) - Um, not really.  But, uh, there's some apps you can download,  and, uh, I think somebody wrote a book.  You'll figure it all out, right?  Hey, if those three men could have a baby, you'll be fine.  Okay! I'm gonna stop trying  to hold this sucker in!  BOB (exhales): Okay.  I-I think that's it. So, uh,  you guys will be able to go on your Ferris wheel date now.  He he seems nice. How long have you been going out?  Um, since whenever I leave here with him.  This will be our first date.  - (phone rings) - Oh, can you grab that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bob's B  Oh. Uh, Patricia's 77 Sandwiches.  Oh, okay, a catering order. Uh, let me ask.  Uh, how many sandwiches?  Whoa. And when do you need them by?  Okay, hold on. Let me check.  - Patricia. - Yeah.  They went 77 sandwiches. One of each.  It's for 40 minutes from now.  What? That's, like, two sandwiches a minute.  So, should I say yes?  No. I can't do that many sandwiches that fast.  But you've got help. You-you can't say no to this.  - (chuckles) I don't know. - 77 sandwiches, Patricia.  This is so exciting. This is the sandwich Olympics.  This is what we've been training for.  Oh, my God. Okay, let's do it.  - Yes! 77 sandwiches! - (whoops)  Oh, oh, oh, I got to tell the guy.  Oh. Y-You heard all that?  We're all doing this!  Yes! All right, I got to go! I love you!  - BOB: 33. - 34.  Okay, number 35. Salami, mozzarella,  red pepper, olive tapenade.  Got it. Oh, hey, Steve. You need anything?  Nope. Just, uh, I got to head back to work soon, so  Right. Don't worry, we're we're almost done.  - 36. - Aah! Got ahead of me.  - Catch up. - I love this!  - 51. - 52!  - 66. - 67!  BOB: And 68! Ha-ha-ha-ha!  74. Whew! You are breathing very hard, Bob.  I know. (whimpers)  It's alarming. I-I-I might be dying.  But this is worth it.  And 77 sandwiches.  (door opens)  Hi. I'm here to pick up the  - Whoa. - Yes, yes. He's a mess.  (panting): Do you, uh, do you need  - do you need help to your car? - Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.  Oh. Steve, did you, uh, did you see that?  Oh. Oh. Steve is gone.  (exhales): Oh Right. Steve.  He left a note. ""Hey, Patricia, you're great,  ""and I would have loved to have gone out with you,  ""but I get that the restaurant comes first.  So I'll stop bugging you.""  Hmm. Seems like an overreaction.  Well, I have stood him up before.  A lot. 11 times, possibly.  I guess that is a lot of times.  What am I supposed to do  Take a day off every time I want to go on a date?  Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no.  What? What? What? What?  My family was right I did need a day off.  And instead of taking one,  I went and worked at a different restaurant,  and I got you into my craziness, too.  Uh-uh, uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no.  This is not your fault. This restaurant is my life.  I mean, someday maybe I'll have 15 minutes  to go out with a nice guy like Steve,  but not right now.  I put all my savings into this place.  This is the only thing I'm doing right now.  Right, I-I totally get it.  I just all day everyone's been telling me  I needed a day off, and I-I got mad, because I love to work,  but they said that to me because they care about me.  And having someone in your corner, well, that's what makes  - doing all of this worth it. - Oh, well,  now you're gonna make me cry, Bob. Great.  Look, I'm not saying you have to marry Steve,  or any guy right now, I'm just saying that  I have one thing that's more important to me  than my restaurant, and that's my family.  Although a lot of times that's very difficult.  Mm. So you're saying I ought to do that thing  where I run and find Steve?  I mean yeah.  Who's gonna clean up and close?  - I'll-I'll close. - You'd close for me?  It's nasty in here.  I didn't say I'd clean up. I said I'd close.  - Now, go. - Okay, I'm going.  Thanks, Bob. You're all right for a bread perv.  Where are the damn paramedics?!  I'm sure they'll be here soon.  You just keep breathing, Goldie.  (loud panting)  Oh, boy!  - What? What? What? - Get these pants off me,  'cause this baby is signaling for the off-ramp.  Well, I guess we're having another biker baby.  Will it drive out on a tiny motorcycle?  I can't remember.  All of my life, I've been told to slow down   To stop, to rest   Take a look around   That life could be more than a pile of ground beef   And while I believe   That that's your belief   Nothing makes me happier   Than serving some food to some guy   It may seem so boring, it might get you snoring   But to me it's the Fourth of July   Oh, nothing makes me happier   Than the smell of a freshly-baked bun   Nothing makes me happier   Than a burger that's perfectly done   Oh, the crumpled-up napkin   All covered in grease   The french fries so crisp that you'll call the police   It's not bragging to say   That they might cause world peace   Nothing makes me happier   Than cooking again and again   But nothing makes me happier   Than them.     (siren wailing)  Oh, my God.  Bobby! Another biker had a baby in our restaurant.  This time standing up by the stools.  - Hi, Dad. I'm a doula now. - And I'm a father.  If you want some afterbirth, I think there's still a bunch  on the floor. No one's called dibs.  Did you guys use buns to clean up the blood?  They're fine. Don't be a princess.  Oh, you are all fired.  - LINDA: All right! - (cheering)  BELCHERS:  You're the best in the sandwich game   How many sandwiches can you name? 25   Salmon, cream cheese, onions and chives   - 31  - Turkey meat loaf on an artisan bun   - Number three  - Fancy peanut butter and jelly   - 14  - Swiss, salami and aioli, queen     - 33  - Turkey bacon, peanut butter, honey   - 42  - Sriracha, turkey on French bread, boo   - 56  - Ham, Swiss and mayo with a spring mix   -  69  -  69, I just say nice   87.   I don't have 87, don't be trying to trick me.  It was a good year."
"1  It's so unfair I got in trouble today.  So unfair.  Right? I mean, there I was, grooving my way  into probably the most revolutionary sound  the world has ever heard,  and Mr. Frond calls it a ""major disturbance""?  (babbling)  Gene Belcher, dear God in heaven.  But you were going for annoying, right?  No. It's a special sound.  With a special purpose, I assume.  Alarm clock companies are always looking for new sounds.  (groans) Come on, let's go to the bar.  I want to knock back a couple before going home.  (sighs) That takes the edge off.  (shudders) Oysters.  I miss the dumpling house days.  Yeah, and the taco truck days.  Nah, I'm over those places.  Dollar oysters are my new tacos.  One more Kumamoto, please, Charles.  - You got it, Gene. - Ew.  Look at that green blob. No judgment.  Looks like if whale diarrhea and Gene's diarrhea had a baby.  - Aw. - It might be ugly, but that right there  is the most important stuff in the entire ocean.  It's plankton.  - Plankton, you say? - Yeah.  It's the food small critters eat, like these oysters.  Then the small critters get eaten by big critters and so on,  all the way up to Godzilla.  You hear that? You sure you guys don't want to try one?  It's full of plankton and tastes like delicious post-nasal drip.  (slurps) Mm  (retches)  (metal clicking)  Can you believe I got banned from making an amazing sound  very much like this at school?  You could also stop making that sound here.  Yeah, Gene, I love your sounds, but this one is killing me.  It's a little annoying.  Annoying?  Yeah, this is the album where your fans go,  ""Ooh, what happened?""  And then you go to rehab and your comeback is amazing.  (groans) Okay, you know what?  That's about all the negativity a boy can take in one day.  - Aw, where you going, sweetie? - I need some fresh air.  Huh. But Gene hates fresh air.  Tina, Louise, you better go with him. It's getting dark out.  But you said these menus won't wipe themselves.  - So they will wipe themselves. - Just go.  Annoying?  Just wait. When I'm dead, my sounds  are gonna be in the Top 40 and you guys are gonna say,  ""Gene was doing that years ago."" (grunts)  What the ? That's weird.  Are you seeing this?  Yeah. Let me try.  - LOUISE and GENE: Whoa - TINA: Damn.  And underwater aliens will be snatching us in three, two  - Whoa. - Ooh.  Well, that is just  You are gorgeous, whatever you are.  I I love you, magic water?  - TREV: Nice bags! - What?  Let me guess, you bought stuff for your burgers?  Uh, yeah.  - That's what I thought. - Wait, sorry, Trev.  Was that supposed to be an insult?  - Zoom? - I guess it was.  Jimmy put me in charge while he's out of town.  He's in Key Largo. Then Montego.  He's trying to hit every place in the song ""Kokomo.""  - Uh-huh. - It's weird not having Jimmy around.  Okay, Trev, uh. I need to go inside now.  These bags are starting to get heavy. And, uh, I want to.  - Trev is acting weird. - He misses Jimmy. He told me.  Aw, I feel bad for him.  I don't. Or I guess I do.  But I feel bad for a lot of other people before him.  - Where are the kids? - They're at the oyster bar.  Again?  Yeah, they saw glowing lights in the ocean last night.  They want to find out if they saw God  or if it's something radioactive.  So they're gonna poke at it some more.  GENE: Beautiful blue thingy? Where are you?  Here's the Glencrest order. What you doing, Gene?  You haven't seen a majestic blue creature around, have you?  Blue creature? What kind of blue we talking about?  It's like if you dropped the Blue Man Group in a blender.  There was this amazing blue glowing thing right there,  but now there's just that ugly plankton blob.  Oh yeah, that. It's the same blob.  -Say what? -Well, sometimes plankton glow at night.  It's called bioluminescent.  So it's gross during the day, but fun and frisky at night?  - Like leather pants? - Yeah.  Sometimes they glow, sometimes they move around a little bit.  They're very sensitive to all sorts of stuff.  Light, sound, movement, arguments, personal slights.  For some it's an eyesore,  but they're not seeing what's really there.  So you're just an annoying blob, huh?  You and me both, pal.  MAN: We got to kill that plankton?  - MAN 2: Uh-huh. - Wait, what?  Boss said if that plankton doesn't go away  before the regatta, we got to bleach it.  Ha, you said ""regatta, we gotta.""  (laughing): Did I say ""regatta, we gotta""?  You did, you did.  No! They're gonna kill my blob buddy!  Hah. ""Regatta, we gotta.""  Aw, my little Gene Cousteau, look so handsome.  Thank you, Mother. And thank you, Father,  for loaning me your ascot.  That is a dish rag, but it looks good on you.  So you really think you can just talk these yacht club people  out of killing an ugly plankton blob?  First of all, don't call it ugly.  It's just saving it all for the nighttime.  And yes, yes, I do.  Okay. How, exactly?  I'll reason with them. They eat oysters, oysters eat plankton,  bing, bang, boom, they decide not to kill the plankton blob.  Then we smoke cigars, then binge-watch Billions.  Well, I see zero holes in this plan.  -Thank you. -Louise, Tina, go with your brother.  What? Why do we have to keep Gene-sitting  this Gene-tastrophe?  Yeah, we have a life. Oh, wait.  He's already feeling a little poopy about everyone pooping  on his sounds and now he's feeling bad about this blob.  - Come on, be nice. - Kids, go or clean.  - Oh! Okay, yeah, see you later. - We're going, we're going.  Hello, hi. Can I help you kids?  I'd like to speak with Mr. Crest. Mr. Glen Crest.  Glencrest is the name of our club, not an individual.  My brother is here to speak with the club president  about a pressing matter.  Our president is too busy with regatta preparations to talk to kids.  - So - And we're gonna  - breeze right past you now. - What? Wait. No.  - LOUISE: Thank you. - Oh Oh, fine.  Hey, Mr. Important Man Sir, got a sec?  Um, not really. Who are you?  We're here to save the plankton blob in your marina.  I overheard your henchmen talking about bleaching it.  You overheard that, did you?  Well, it is one of the options we're exploring.  But you can't! From one oyster lover to another, be reasonable.  That's the stuff that feeds the stuff  that feeds our pretty faces.  But that annoying blob isn't supposed to be  in our private marina.  The wind blew it in, and it's not blowing it out.  You're being a blob-snob.  And a bit of an algae-hole.  Not to mention a, um, um  Uh, come back to me.  Don't make me go to Channel Six News with this.  Olsen Benner would rip this story wide open,  like she did with that day-old muffin exposÃ©.  I see. Well, here's something you might not have known:  that blob is most likely full of toxins  - that can kill shellfish. - Wait, what?  Kids, that's a bad blob. Bad blob!  Bad plankton? Is that possible?  How about this? Just to be certain,  I'll order, uh, a study of the plankton.  Really?  Of course. We don't want to bleach healthy plankton.  No one cares more about ocean life than yacht clubs.  Our boats literally float on the ocean.  - Good point. - Is it, though?  Look, I've got to tend to other matters now,  but you kids feel free to sample our buffet.  The raw bar is your oyster. (chuckles)  Thanks. See, I told you they'd be reasonable here.  Oh, ooh, wow.  Al, get these kids whatever they want.  - I want to not be near oysters. - I'll take, uh,  three fingers of your most expensive ginger ale.  And that tub of cherries, straight-up.  Hi, Trev.  I bet if Jimmy was here, he'd make fun of you  for not having any customers.  Uh, that seems about right.  Yeah. Jimmy's the best.  Mm-hmm. Maybe not the best.  Sometimes I kind of wish Jimmy and I  wouldn't pick on you so much.  Really? Okay. You-you could stop.  Ha! ""Stop."" Good one. Up top.  We-we don't have to high-five.  It's just, I haven't high-fived Jimmy in a while.  He texted me and we swapped high five emojis,  but it's not the same. See?  He texted ""Bob's dumb.""  Oh, wow. So, you guys make fun of me in your free time?  Mostly just Jimmy.  You know what, Trev? You actually seem  like sort of a niceish guy.  You shouldn't let Jimmy turn you into a meanie weenie.  I'm not a meanie weenie.  Well, you act like one when you're with Jimmy.  You act like one when you're with Jimmy.  It's just high-fiving. Geesh.  I'm not gonna leave a guy hanging.  That's not how I was raised.  I hope Jimmy comes back soon.  And we breeze right past you  - Wait, I Oh, oh Fine. - Mm-hmm.  Hey, there, Mr. President Man Sir.  So did you get the results back?  - Uh, the what? - The plankton study?  Ah, yes, uh, the plankton study.  Oh, shoot, it is a bad blob.  - Really? Oh, no. - Sorry, Gene.  - Can we see the report? - Uh, yeah, sure. There it is.  Uh Oh. Wait. Uh, oh  No Nope, that no, that's all you need.  Oh Uh  No, no, no, no. It's all science mumbo jumbo,  but, uh look, over there.  That's the oceanographer. He did the study.  I'll have him dumb it down for you.  Uh, we tested the plankton and it has, uh,  high levels of bad stuff in it.  Bad stuff like what? Bullets? Knives?  Well, I'm sure you're a very busy oceanographer,  - so off you go. - To do oceanography somewhere else.  - Oh, cool. Where? - Uh, the ocean.  - Oh, right. Yeah. - So that's it?  - You're gonna bleach it? - But if you bleach the marina,  won't that kill everything in the water,  not just the plankton?  No, no, no, it's actually a very Eco-friendly process.  Just before the regatta, we'll sprinkle some bleach powder.  It gets an A+ rating from the Ocean's Eleven, uh, Institute  - of Oceans. - LOUISE: Mm-hmm.  - Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye, now. - Oh, wait, uh  - Turn around, walk away. There you go. - Okay.  All right, kids. Wonderful to see you. (laughs)  Hey, so, I guess you aren't such a good blob after all.  That's cool. That oceanographer is bringing champagne to  his oceanography friends?  Yeah, he is not an oceanographer. He's a waiter.  But he knew all the terminology.  (gasps) They tricked us.  - They're gonna bleach a good blob. - Bastards.  I'm going back in there to ask them to borrow their phone  to call Channel Six News.  You could do that, or we can beat them  - at their own game. - How do we do that?  Well, right now, they don't know you know they tricked you.  - So? - So use it.  Let them think they won so they keep their guard down  - for what we're gonna do. - What are we gonna do?  Well, I've got an idea. We're gonna need someone with a boat,  knowledge of yacht clubs and who'd love  to take Glencrest down in tomorrow's regatta.  Oh, you asked for us to step outside?  Duncan, why do we even live on an island  if just anyone can come here?  - For the views? - Shush.  Sasha, Duncan, we have a proposition  you guys help us stop Glencrest from killing  the plankton blob in their marina  And what do we get?  Satisfaction of knowing you did the right thing?  I love doing the right thing. It's the best! Right, Sasha?  Yeah, me too Ooh.  - VOICE (echoing): Ankles - TINA: So, no socks, huh?  DUNCAN: No, I'm wearing my boaties.  You don't wear your sockies with your boaties.  -(whistles) Ankles away. -Come again?  - Anky Doodle Damn, D. - Sorry?  - Little something for the ank bank. - I'm not following.  - Oh, you mean my leg knobs? - I sure do.  I don't know what you two are talking about,  but as far as your little plankton plan goes,  - that's a hard no. - (groans)  But it's partly your people's fault this is happening.  Uh, sorry, how's that?  Glencrest only wants to bleach the plankton blob  so that it's gone in time for the stupid regatta  - against your stupid yacht club. - But if the plankton blob  is still there for the start of the regatta  That blob will make Glencrest look like total slobs.  So what's the plan?  Some Hench-people are gonna sprinkle bleach powder  onto the blob tomorrow morning.  But we want them to think they sprinkled bleach,  so we need to replace their bleach powder  with something else, something that won't hurt  - the ocean, like baking powder or - Panko.  - Panko? - Bread crumbs.  Bread crumbs, of course.  Bread crumbs make everything better.  We probably have that at the restaurant,  but it's not nearly enough.  We have, like, a ton of panko in the kitchen right here.  - Why? - Oh, I don't know,  maybe because a yacht club goes through  a Jacuzzi's worth of fried shrimp every day.  How do we get the panko?  I'm a member of a yacht club, young man.  When I ask for panko, they ask, ""How panked?""  So we have a deal? We save the blob,  you get to embarrass Glencrest, everyone's happy.  -Deal. -Duncan, let's shake ankles on it.  Well, I, I would like to respect your country's customs.  (grunting)  I suppose I'm up for it. (laughs nervously)  Hey, guys. Sorry I freaked out yesterday.  Well, I'm sorry I called you a meanie weenie.  Yeah, guess I wasn't ready to admit  the only bond I have with Jimmy  - is making hilarious fun of Bob. - It's not hilarious.  But I don't want to be a meanie weenie like you said.  I want to be a nicey weenie.  -So what are you gonna do about it? -I don't know.  Well, you can't stop Jimmy from insulting Bob,  but you can stop high-fiving him.  Aw, that's the best part.  Plus, like I told you, it's impossible.  Come on, we'll role-play.  - I'll be Jimmy and I'll insult Bob. - Mm-hmm.  Hey, I'm Bob, I cry at the end of every movie.  - Up top. - (laughs) Cries.  - Not every movie. - No, don't high-five.  Oh, right. But it's hard not to.  - It's like a a reflex. - It's okay.  - Let's try again. - Oh, my God.  I'm Bob, I was born with armpit stains. Uh, zoom.  - (laughs, groans) - Uh-uh.  W-What are we doing? What is this?  We're role-playing. I'm pretending to be  Jimmy Pesto making fun of Bob so Trev stops high-fiving him.  - Can I play? - I-It's not really a game, it's just  I'm Bob, I look like a dog from the '70s. Up top.  (wheezing laughter): Dog!  - LINDA: No. - D'aw.  - (groans) - I'm Bob, my barber can't decide  where my neck hair ends and my back hair begins.  - (laughing) - No high five.  - Aw, I can't. I just can't. - Hmm.  I'm Bob. I'm scared of long hugs.  I don't want to hug you. That's not scared of long hugs.  I'm Bob and I have a birth mark near my peehole  that makes it look like I have a double peehole.  Lin.  (wheezing): Double peehole.  Yay, you didn't high-five.  Breakthrough.  Wow, I did it.  - Isn't it great, Bob? - Yup.  Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. This has been really great.  Ahoy. Can I get a little help with the tie-off, please?  Uh, we're kind of busy right now.  Great, thanks, my family just joined.  I'm sure you got the club-wide bulletin?  - Are they buying it? - Yeah.  I just have to yacht-splain a few things and we'll be good.  Uh, no one told us anything, so  Oh, it's so okay, these things happen, it's not your fault.  I can tell you guys are great.  My dad's boat is called the Cha-Ching,  as you can tell, but new yacht club, new name.  I assume you guys have decals ready for the rename?  - Decals? - Again, not your fault.  Let's just take a walk to the decal shed.  Come, come, come, come, come. So, name-wise,  I'm thinking Boaty Boaty Bo-Boaty,  Banana Fana Flo-Floaty Me My Mo-Moaty,  unless another member already has that name.  Tina, there must have been a rat below deck  'cause something was tickling my ankles.  Uh, yep, that's rats for you.  Um, did it feel good?  - Well, it felt weird. - Weird good?  - Creepy weird. - Creepy weird good?  - Creepy weird bad? - Creepy weird bad good?  Sorry, bread crumbs.  You're being sacrificed so that blob may live.  SASHA: We're walking back to my boat now  since we couldn't find the decal shed.  Which is embarrassing for you guys.  Wait a second, does that say Glencrest Yacht Club?  Oh, my goodness. This is crazy.  I'm a new member at Crestglen Yacht Club.  I'm sure this happens all the time.  Stay in touch, okay, bye.  Shoo, you dumb birds. Don't eat the bleach.  Jeepers, the gullies are having a crack at the crumbies.  Hey, wait a second.  This isn't bleach. It's bread crumbs.  - Stop that boat. - LOUISE: Go, go, go!  What the Hey!  -(panting) -LOUISE: Can't this thing go any faster?  SASHA: You can't make wake in a marina. We're not animals.  (grunts)  Um, you might want to make that wake.  That jerk can't stop us.  Catch it, catch it.  (grunts)  - Oh, crap, that jerk stopped us. - Yacht blocker!  GLENCREST PRESIDENT: So, you switched the powdered bleach with bread crumbs.  Well played, but not well played enough.  You lied about the plankton study.  That was no oceanographer, he was a fantastic waiter.  I don't need an oceanographer to tell me  that ugly blob needs to go. Just look at it.  - Yuck! - Aah! Stop calling it ugly.  It's a majestic life-giving plankton blob  and it's damn sexy at night.  We'll be taking our bleach back now. Hand it over.  - No. No. - Give me the bleach.  - Hand the bleach - No, no, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no, no!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no I want the bleach!  -Ugh! -Go on board their boat, get our bleach,  bleach the blob, do it now!  The head, the head, the head. Quick, quick, quick, quick.  - GENE: The what? - The toilet.  - Flush the goods. - The goods?  The bleach. Dump the bleach in the toilet.  But won't that go into the ocean?  No, there's a tank. God, you're so poor.  Oops, sorry, Hench-folk.  We just flushed it down the toilet.  Now it's in the boat's butt.  So annoying. Get off the boat,  go to the store, buy some more bleach,  save the receipt! And get ice.  Well, we're gonna tell the world that you bleached the bay.  Go ahead. I'll deny it.  Plus, no one cares. The blob is bad, not the bleach.  Bleach is good, it makes things clean.  Haven't you ever seen a bleach commercial?  Don't lecture me about bleach commercials,  they're the reason why I never felt the need  to learn how to properly wipe.  You know what? I don't have any more time for this.  The regatta is starting soon and I gotta have  my pre-regatta piÃ±a colada.  Time for you kids to leave.  That vessel is forbidden  to ever enter the Glencrest Marina again.  So that's it? The baddies win?  The little plankies die?  No. We have to keep their bleach boat away from the plankton.  We got to go Greenpeace on their butts.  But how? We're blocked from even getting into the marina.  What about if we sneak in?  LOUISE: We'll have, uh, five kayaks for a half-day rental.  Sasha, the plastic?  You got to be at least 18 to rent a boat.  How about I throw in a crispy hundo?  Hmm, I don't know.  We're on a blob-itarian mission.  Yeah, we need to rent five of your best piddle-paddles  - to save a blobby. - Piddle-paddles?  -The kayaks! Please! -(sighs) Go ahead, take the kayaks.  - Give me the money. - Aren't they gonna  recognize us if we go back out there?  Right. We need disguises.  Do you have a lost and found?  Uh, yeah, we do.  - Good. 'Cause we lost this. - Oh.  - And this. - Wow.  - I'm glad we found this guy. - Okay.  Floral swimsuit cover-up? Mine.  - TINA: How do we look? - If Greenpeace looked  as fabulous as us, there'd be too many whales.  (gasps) The Hench-people are back.  Spread out. Make a line.  Get between the bleach boat and the blob.  Okay, no problem.  I can definitely maneuver this boat.  Guys, wh-where'd you go?  Stop, you murderous Hench-jerks!  You! In the blouse!  It's a swimsuit cover-up, you rube!  I don't care what it is. Get out of my marina.  No, and as blob is my witness,  that bleach boat shall not pass.  Will you hurry it up a bit?  And will someone push their kayaks into the sea?  We're allowed to do that, right?  - We're not going anywhere! - Huh.  Gene, keep banging your paddle.  Gladly.  LOUISE: Uh, I might sound crazy, but it looked like  - that blob just moved a little. - That blob is a-moving.  What?  When you bang your paddle, the blob moves away.  You're right. It is moving away.  Charles said it reacts to sounds.  Charles said it reacts to sounds!  Everyone, bang your paddles.  Um, I thought we wanted to keep the blob in the marina  to embarrass Glencrest?  Damn it, Sasha, this isn't about Glencrest  or Kingshead Island, it's about giving  a misunderstood blob a chance.  (sighs) Damn it, Gene.  You gave me goose bumps. Dunc, are we on board with this?  Sasha? M-My opinion on something?  Never mind, forget it. Gene, we're doing it.  Come on. Let's Pied Piper this sucker.  Technically, a reverse Pied Piper.  Even the plankton wants to get away from Gene's sounds.  That's very insulting, but I'm glad it worked.  I told you my sounds have a purpose.  What the hell are you waiting for?  Push through the kayaks and bleach the damn thing.  We don't need to. It's moving away on its own.  Don't tell me you don't need Oh, yeah. Look at that.  - It's working. - Keep banging.  Go, buddy. Back to the ocean.  Back where you belong.  - TINA: Yay. - LOUISE: All right!  (kids cheering)  Hmm.  Maybe you were the beauty  and I was the beast.  It's time to regatta!  Jimmy's back.  Things are gonna change when he meets the new Trev.  You can do this, Trev.  Uh, so, listen, Jimmy.  I-I was thinking about our dynamic and  Yeah, I had a great time, thanks.  Check it out, I got you something.  Whoa. You brought me back something?  From Kokomo?  A sexy lady bottle opener.  - (laughs) - Wow, Jimmy.  - I love it. - Yeah, well, don't get so mushy.  Hey, look at Bob over there.  I just got back from vacation and already  he's Jamaican me sad.  (chuckles) Zoo-woom.  (laughs) 'Cause you went to Jamaica.  Yup, there it is.  - I can't, my hand's sick. - Ew, gross.  Wow, Lin, you did that.  I didn't think that was gonna work,  but you might have helped Trev grow up a little bit.  Hey, Bob. Bob.  - Hey, Bob. - What, Jimmy?  Trev here, he just told me you got a peehole birthmark.  (laughs): Whoa! Let me see it.  - Great. - You wish you had  a peehole birthmark.  - Oh, they're gone. - You got 'em, Lin.  High five.  How you doing, Gene?  I didn't think it'd be so hard to say goodbye.  But now the blob will live in peace  What's happening?  It's getting eaten up.  GENE: Oh, oh, wow.  - That is rough to watch. - TINA: Yeah. Ugh.  If any of you survive whatever's  violently attacking you now,  I'll see you inside an oyster.  -  Bioluminescence  - (babbling rhythmically)  Lighten up the sea   Bioluminescence   Come on board with me   Bioluminescence   Lighten up the sea   Bioluminescence   Come on board with me   -   - (thumping rhythmically)  -  Bioluminescence  - (babbling rhythmically)  Lighten up the sea   Bioluminescence   Come on board with me."
"1  LOUISE (as Kuchi Kopi): We meet again, Dodomeki.  It is time for us to go  on the really big quest. Together.  LOUISE (as Dodomeki): Yes, Kuchi Kopi.  We're finding that, um,  that amulet and it won't be easy.  So here we go.  -Pew! -Wait, why'd you make that sound?  Oh, never mind, I don't know. Pretend I didn't do that.  Well, that's impossible. It was really distracting  and kind of forced, or something.  Sorry, it's just hard to get into this for some reason.  It's fine, we're fine.  Let's just do the thing.  - Hey, Louise. You okay? - Huh?  What? Yeah.  Of course I'm okay, I'm great.  This is going great.  Okay, well, time for breakfast.  Mom's exact words were,  ""Guess what time it is. Egg thirty.""  Um, unless I'm interrupting.  Uh, no, I was just wrapping up.  - So, we're having eggs? - No.  - Oh. - But yeah, it's egg thirty.  Okay, kids. I packed you an extra delicious exotic lunch  for your field trip today.  It's chunky peanut butter, huh?  Ooh la la.  Louise, you excited?  Your first time going to the marionette theater.  Easy, Mom. You're setting Louise up for disappointment.  What? I thought you loved that place.  It's the greatest show on strings.  Eh not the greatest, actually.  It's the same not-so-great show every year.  No matter how bored you are, don't fall asleep.  The puppets follow you into your dreams!  No, it's fun. Remember, Bob?  We took Gene and Tina there when they were little?  - It's great, right? - Uh, it's bad.  - It was a bad day. - Bob.  What? It was long and boring and made me want  to stop supporting the arts and start  actively working against them.  I'm sure it'll be fine.  Anything's better than being at school.  I mean, you'd think so  Aw, you're all a bunch of puppet poopers.  I wish I was a marionette.  Someone doing all the work for me,  moving my arms and legs around.  Wah, wah, wah, wah. Wah, wah, wah  Well, there's your beautiful bride, Dad.  - Ah, you get what you get. - Wah, wah, wah  FROND: Okay.  For those of you who haven't been  to the Esther Margaret Marionette-Odeum,  here's the rundown.  We start the day with a glorious puppet show.  Was hoping for a little more reaction there, but okay.  Next, there's a puppet-building workshop.  - And finally, you'll perform - ZEKE: Whoo, yeah!  - Uh, a bit late on that, Zeke. - Oh, got it.  I'll get it next time. Keep doing what you're doing.  Uh, uh, okay.  Anyway, then you'll break off into groups  and perform your own puppet show for each other.  Anything to add, Ms. Labonz?  Don't bring me into this.  Oh, okay. Uh, let's go inside.  Well, let's just get through this, right, Zeke?  If I die of boredom, tell my story.  You know I will.  Oh, come on. It's a puppet show.  It can't be that bad.  PUPPETEERS:  Stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp   Stamp, stamp, stamp   And that's a song about stamps.   - Oh, my God. - (groans, gasps)  Well, hello there. I'm Stampson.  And as you can see, I've been to some pretty interesting places.  I guess you could say that I really like stamps.  But who doesn't?  Does anyone here know where I could find a stamp?  Is that Ron the health inspector?  - Oh, yeah. - Did he get arrested?  Is this community service?  Look, a box. And it's lost.  BOX: Hey, everyone. Which way to Milwaukee?  We'll tell you, but first, you need a  Stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp   Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far.  Far, far away from here.  - (muffled chatter) - Huh.  - Lin, look at this guy. - Oh.  What's he doing? What's he wearing?  - Great show, it's a rave. - Hi.  Uh, can I help you?  Or is it: can I help you?  BOB: Supercala-Rave-A-Glowstick?  Mm-hmm. Thursdays are 18-plus rave nights at the Dance Hole.  - Dubstep, trip-trance. - Uh-huh, yeah. Right.  - Electro-hop, doo-wop-hop. - Yeah, right. Right, I-I got it.  - Polynesian speed gospel. - I got it. Sir, I got it.  Um, can I ask you if you wouldn't mind not flyering here?  I mean, flyers are great, but you're kind of  standing right in front of my restaurant.  - Oh, uh, my bad. - Thanks.  - But I can't move. - What? W-Why?  My boss told me to flyer right here in this spot.  And he said he's gonna come by and check on me.  And if I'm not in this exact spot, I won't get paid.  Well, that seems ridiculous. Just move 20 feet that way.  - I'm sure he won't care. - He was very specific, okay?  I can't risk it. I need the money  for this little dude's medical bills.  - BOB: Is that a - It's a ferret.  My ferret, Karat.  - Okay - He's really old,  but he's still got a lot of spunk.  - Check it. - Oh, wow.  H-He's okay with being put in a shoe?  He likes it. It's where he goes to the bathroom.  It's my roommate's shoe.  - Ride the rave. - No, no, no. No.  Don't cross the street. He-he won't give you a flyer.  - He was just leaving. - I have to give 'em a flyer.  Bob, what's going on out here?  Apparently, this guy needs to hand out flyers  right in front of the restaurant.  Can't you just move half a block up that way?  -I just gave him the same suggestion. -Yeah, he already said  that exact thing. I can't.  Well, should we just pick him up and move him?  You mean, like, each take a side?  Don't do that. I'll make myself heavy.  - Look. (grunting) - Oh, yeah.  - Look at that. - Hmm.  Okay, students. Quiet down.  Let's give a big hand to the woman  who made this all possible, Ms. Esther Margaret!  - (applause) - Hello, children.  Welcome back to the place where imagination comes  with strings attached.  (giggling)  So, find a spot on the floor.  It's time to build your own marionette magic.  Any questions, just ask one of our seasoned volunteers.  Wait, is this it?  She just wants us to put stickers on these?  They stay if you press really hard.  If only that were true of men, huh, sister?  - Is there a problem here? - Um, no.  - It just seems kind of - What?  You don't like building puppets?  I mean, if that's what you're calling this.  - Ron. This one needs help. - Yeah?  Oh, so, uh  Uh, one might want to put a sticker here.  O-Or maybe here.  Ron, I know how stickers work.  - GENE: Brag. - You know what?  Where's the bathroom?  Uh, it's down the hall, to the left.  Great, thanks.  Ugh, the kids get worse and worse every year.  - But people keep making them. - What?  (scoffs) I don't need help. You need help, lady.  Huh?  Uh, that room's off-limits.  What was that puppet?  -It's, uh -None of your business is what it is.  Now go do your business.  If you haven't done it in your diapers already.  Easy, lady. If you don't want us to go in that room,  you should have Oh, now I'm seeing the sign.  I was just thinking, little girl.  - Louise. - Uh-huh.  Since the puppet workshop isn't holding your attention,  I'm assigning you with a very special job all your own.  - How's that sound? - Judging by your tone,  - it sounds - That was a rhetorical question.  Come with me.  This is our tech booth.  Usually smells like whatever weird thing Dot's eating.  (mouth full): That's me. Hi.  Dot, I thought you could use  an extra helper in the booth today.  - This is Loosie. - Louise.  - No one's named ""Loosie."" - I must've heard wrong.  Anyway, you two have fun.  - See you at showtime. - Wait, wait, wait (sighs)  - Dried fish skin? - What? No.  Sorry, I chew with my mouth open  'cause I can't breathe through my nose.  - (choking) - Oh.  - Sorry. (gagging) - Great.  Well, welcome to master control. (chuckles)  So, am I here as punishment?  I don't know. Wait. Am I?  Oh, wow. Anyway, well, yeah, let me give you the tour.  Well, there's the master tape deck, cassette library,  fog machine, sound mixer and, uh  - that's the lighting board. - What?  - That one switch? - Yeah, it's got a dimmer.  Well, tour's over.  Are you good or should I do it again?  Oh! I got a flashlight.  - Now we're cooking, huh? - (groans)  - What's taking Louise so long? - If Dad's taught us one thing,  it's not to comment on how long  someone's taking in the bathroom.  (whispering): Your sister's been reassigned  - to the tech booth with Dot. - What? Oh, no.  The Tech Booth with Dot?  I hate that podcast.  Hey, while we're waiting for the shows to start,  want to listen to my beats?  I've been making beats on my phone.  - I mean - Check it out. I call this one  ""Can I Sell My Bed On Craigslist?"" (chuckles)  (instrumental beat playing)  That's a-a funky beat.  I keep asking Esther if we can use one of my beats in the show,  but I'm starting to think that'll never happen.  Well, that's her loss, Dot.  Hey, what can you tell me about that cool puppet  in the ""do not enter"" room?  You know, the one with all the shiny colors  - and the arms and ? - Oh, that's Vladikus.  Don't let Esther catch you looking at that puppet.  (sighs) Too late. What's the deal?  Is she jealous she can't make something as cool as that?  No, Esther did make that puppet.  - No way. - Yes way.  She used to do all sorts of cool shows  with all sorts of crazy puppets  - back in the day. - Whoa.  DOT: Well, those pants made more sense back then.  Why did Esther stop using Vladikus?  I don't know. She just stopped.  Uh-oh, it's time for another beat, I think!  I call this ""Where Did I Leave My Bra?  - I Only Have One. Oh, There It Is."" - (beat playing)  Oh, God! Oh, God  Look at him. He's freaking out.  (sighs) I guess I should check on him.  Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!  - Uh, are you okay? - My ferret is gonna die, man!  Oh, what? Karat?  Yes! My roommate was supposed to give him his medicine.  But apparently, she's not ""comfortable  putting suppositories up his anus.""  Well, then, go. Y-You leaving seems like  a great idea for everyone.  I can't, I told you. I'll get fired.  (sighs) I really don't think your boss is gonna check on you.  I can't risk it. This job is all I have.  This job and Karat. Oh! Can you help me? Be me.  Just pass out my flyers so I can go keep  - my best friend alive. - Uh, wait. I, um  I promise I'll be right back. It'll be so fast.  Uh  You'll look more like me if you wear this.  W-Wait. No, no, no. No, no, no.  Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Hey! U-Uh, come back!  - Oh, Bobby. What happened? - (sighs) I-I don't know.  - Do you want a flyer? - Ew, no.  Okay, children.  Time for you to become the storytellers.  So let your imagination run wild  within the boundaries we've set for you.  And remember scripts are the words  that you say in the show.  - I don't need you to do that. - Uh Oh.  Um, it looks like most of it's written,  but then there are these blank spaces?  - It's like Mad Libs. - More like Sad Libs.  (laughs) Who's with me?  - (laughing) - Yeah.  - Oh, okay. Get over here! - Ow. Zeke!  Okay, let's see what we got here.  ""I'm Princess blank. I live in the Kingdom of blank.  Oh, look. There's Prince blank.""  That's easy. Fart, pudding, ding-dong, done.  Hey, look what you made.  That guy could be Vladikus' cousin  if Vladikus was made out of electrical cords and tape.  - Hey, make it dance. - Oh, I don't know.  I can't really  - Try not to dance to this. - (beat playing)  It's called ""My Prescription Will Be Ready  When It's Ready, I Guess.""  Ooh, ah, ooh, ah.  Okay. Looks a little awkward,  but you're getting it, huh?  You want to show your little friends?  Are they, uh, open-minded?  Uh, do you, uh, like to, uh, rave?  Yeah, yeah, I-I understand.  You still doing this?  Ugh. He said he'd be right back.  Here's a fl a flyer. Flyer. Uh, rave?  I guess I'm just not good at this.  Bob, you shouldn't be doing this at all,  but if you're gonna do it, do it better.  You got to be more confident. Use your wrist.  You flick it. Flick it out.  - Okay, like - Like a booger.  Uh  You know, when you're laying in bed at night.  Wait, you flick your boogers in bed?  Yeah, I just Yeah, just into the radiator.  That's disgu Into the radiator?  - Yeah, it burns 'em off. - What?  Yeah, my mom taught me how.  All right, I'm going to ignore that,  'cause I can't think about that right now.  - Here's my flick. Heh! - Oh, cool flyer.  There you go, Bobby. Good one.  Oh, here comes someone else.  - Go, go, go, go, go. - Ha!  - Ooh. - Ha!  - Okay, ooh-hoo - Boom! Bow!  You're a friggin' frequent flyer.  Louise, you're not supposed to be out here.  - I know, but - Loosie, get in the booth.  The first group is about to perform.  Oh, my God, what is that scrap pile?  It's a puppet I made.  Uh-huh. With six legs.  And you came up with that design all by yourself?  - Well, I mean - We both know that you didn't.  Okay, fine, I borrowed a few ideas  from the puppet in the forbidden room.  What's your problem, lady?  I think I made it pretty clear that you're my problem.  Hey, the arm and the string came off my  (laughs) I'm your problem?  I'm assuming you're a lot of people's problem.  I'll make it work.  You know, judging by your attitude,  I think it's quite clear that you don't want to be here.  I got news for you, lady.  - No one wants to be here! - (all gasping)  Including you, apparently.  What kind of place does the same show for 30 years?  Maybe Phantom of the Opera? Sorry.  Also, Les Mis ran forever.  Don't forget Cats.  Yes, many musicals.  But this place is a soul-sucking cycle of suck!  (Gene and Tina groan)  Get out. You are banned from this theater.  What? You can't ban me. This is a field trip.  No, you can be banned.  Go sit on the bus with Ms. Labonz.  Great! Wonderful!  Sitting on the bus will be better  than watching this crap show!  Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.  We totally had Louise's back, right?  You mean with the not speaking up  or having her back in any way?  Yeah.  LOUISE: Ugh.  Who even wants to be at a place where a bunch of  dumb junk on strings gets dragged around anyway?  I'm not a cat.  Pipe down, Louise, you're in trouble.  AUTOMATED VOICE: Dip, dip, dip.  - Double dip. Dip. - What is that?  It's a game called Dippin' Chips.  You have to dip chips into different kinds off dip.  I'm on level 544.  AUTOMATED VOICE: Double dip. Double dip.  Yes!  Hey, Ms. Labonz, would you say all grown-ups give up  and just become awful?  Some do, and then some of us just keep getting  more amazing every day.  Now, let me dip in peace.  ""And Princess Puppet and Princess Girl lived  happily ever after in the Kingdom of blank.""  Oh, we we forgot to fill that one in.  So let's just say Jocelyn.  The end. Thank you.  Great. Okay, quickly, quickly  Poor Louise. I feel like  we should go see if she's okay.  Yeah, but how do we get past Mr. Frond and Esther?  They're blocking the exits.  - You want to sneak out? - BOTH: Ah!  Sorry. Um, I can help.  Why do you want to help us?  Are you wearing a wire?  No. Esther was too hard on your sister,  and-and everyone, really. Follow me.  Where are you taking the Christmas village, Ron?  There's a-a spider. A spider's on it,  and, uh, I'm gonna go shake it off outside.  Okay.  (loudly): Go on. Uh, get out of here, spider.  AUTOMATED VOICE: Dip. Double dip. Trip-dip!  You bet your ass that's a trip-dip.  GENE (quietly): Psst! Louise.  What are you guys doing here?  We came to visit you in bus jail.  What's going on back there, Louise?  Nothing. Just thinking about all the bad stuff I did.  -Good. -You guys got to get me out of here.  I want to go back in and tangle some strings,  so to speak.  Uh, Louise, I'm not sure this is the best idea.  Shh. Here, I'm gonna slip out the window.  -You guys catch me. -BOTH: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  - LABONZ: No! - I wasn't doing anything.  Oh, I missed a trip-dip.  - I'm gonna drop. Ready? - GENE: No.  - Oof. - GENE: Ow, my boob.  Huh?  - Dipsy-doodle time! - Hell yeah!  You want one. Hey, empty fingers.  - Looking at you. - Bob, I'm bored.  Are you coming back in?  Lin, what if the guy's boss comes back to check on him?  Plus, I think I'm really good at this.  - Oh, my God! - Oh, no.  Hey, Trev, look at Bob.  He's handing out flyers, and he's dressed like  a crossing guard from Narnia.  - Ha. Boom! - Ha.  Narnia, it's a magical place.  - (laughing) - Shut up, Jimmy.  For your information, Jimmy, Bob's helping out someone  who has a sick carrot.  Lin, it's a ferret, not a carrot.  Oh, that makes more sense.  Sick ferret, Jimmy!  You know what, Jimmy, I don't care what you say,  because I'm the best damn flyerer  Oh, my God, I just dropped all the flyers.  Ha! You're dumb.  LINDA: Aw, they're flying.  Hey, that's why they call them flyers. Ha!  All right, I'm done.  Okay, so, what's your plan?  Just watch the show and sarcastically applaud?  LOUISE: Nope.  TINA: Well, I know we're not gonna go in there,  since it says ""do not enter.""  -So, what else? What else? Hmm. -We're going in there.  TINA: Damn it.  Psst! Dot.  We've got some new cues for the next show.  Did you say new ""poos""?  New cues.  Oh. Cool.  Ah, there you are. Okay.  Now you're only one little troublemaker short.  I'll fill in for her.  Try to keep up. Dot!    (hissing)  What the ?  Uh (coughs) Oh, no.  I was told that there would be no fog machines.  - (beat playing) - Dot, we talked about this.  - Cool. - Nice.  Oh, yeah, I'm feeling that.    (gasps) Vladikus.  Just what do you think you're doing?  You think you can out-puppet me? Think again.  Well, then, string it on, Mother Puppeter.  RUDY: Looks like we got ourselves an old-fashioned  (inhales sharply) puppet battle.  You think you can handle that puppet?  Pinochi-oh-no-I-don't-think-so.  LOUISE: Oh, really, Miss Poopit Master,  who locked me up for 30 years?  ESTHER: What? She locked you away  for reasons you wouldn't understand!  - LOUISE: What? - I said you wouldn't understand!  Dot, turn down the beats!  You got it!  - (volume lowers) - So why did she lock me up?  Look, things just changed.  Why? Because she gave up?  No. Er, yes. Er, I don't know.  She got older, and at some point,  the puppets just stopped talking to her.  So she put her favorite ones away  and stuck with the easier shows.  The easier show was stamps?  Stamps, yes. Kids love stamps. Everybody knows that.  So, that's what happens?  People put away their favorite puppets,  and kids just stop playing with their toys?  It just goes away?  Well, maybe it didn't have to.  I mean, maybe it only goes away if you let it.  Oh, dang, that's deep. Starting to tear up over here.  Oh, Vladikus, I do miss you.  I'm sorry I hid you away.  -Are those puppets gonna make out? -Hot.  Here, you take him.  Hello, old friend.  -Dot, more fog. Bring the music back up. -On it!  (volume increases)    This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.  Wow, look at her go. Wait, where'd she go?  Is she even in this room anymore?  - ESTHER: Whoa! Oh! - (crashing)  Oh, God, Esther, I should have dialed back on the fog.  - How bad is it? - Just a couple of bruised ribs.  - Well, four. Is four a couple? - Wait, Esther. I thought  you might want to take this guy with you in the ambulance.  - Oh, thank you, Loosie. - Louise.  I'm glad we had our epic puppet battle.  Maybe I should change things up at this old theater.  Ooh, did you see that?  - See what? - Vladikus winked at me.  Whoa! He did it again.  Watch, watch, watch. There. Aha!  We gave her drugs.  All right, students, back on the bus.  Hey, what are you doing in here?  My job. Um, sorry, you just took too long.  - He dropped the flyers. - Lin  What? Oh, God, this is a disaster!  Nobody's gonna check on you.  Hey, why aren't you out front?  I told you I was gonna check on you.  - Oh. - Uh, he was outside.  Uh, but he ran out. Of flyers.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, he was so great. Right, Bob?  - I mean, he was okay. - Oh, shush.  Wow. Uh, okay.  I knew this would be a busy spot.  So, uh, same time here tomorrow?  Wait, wait, wait. He-he can't, uh, he  Uh, you know what, he'd actually do a lot better  in front of that Italian place across the street.  - Right, Lin? - Oh, yeah, yeah.  More sun over there, more people walk over there.  Oh, this side is so dreary. It's like a cemetery.  I mean, it's not like a cemetery.  You know what, done. Other side of the street tomorrow.  I'll send two guys. And, uh, can I have my hat back?  I'm going on a date tonight.  Oh, here it is, right here in my hand.  Uh, by the way, someone perspired in it, um, a lot.  - Uh, that guy did. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Gross.  Hey, Louise, you think you might want to become  a volunteer puppeteer after today?  You had the moves, kinda.  I don't know. There's only so many times  you can reunite an old lady with her long-lost puppet.  Yeah, six.  All I know is, when we get home,  this little fella's gonna do battle with the Kuch.  I hope you know kung fu, babe.  Uh-oh, he's shaking his head.  Oh, that's nice.  Dot let you take that stuff from the tech booth?  Uh, yeah, she absolutely did.  Now let's all just sit quietly  and, um, stare ahead.  GENE: Like The Graduate!  Puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle   Puppet battle, battle, oh, oh, oh   String it on   Puppet battle   Puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle   Puppet battle, battle, oh, oh, oh   Ooh, yeah   Oh, ha   Puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle   Vladikus   Puppet battle, puppet battle   Aha   You gotta puppet battle   Puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle   Puppet battle, battle, oh, oh, oh   String it on   Puppet battle, puppet battle   Puppet battle, puppet battle, puppet battle."
"1  I think Dad's still in a bad mood.  LOUISE: What tipped you off? The way his mustache is twitching?  It looks like a weird little dog having a nightmare.  All right, we're going bowling.  Having fun tonight. Right, Bob?  - BOB: Mm-hmm. - Forgetting our troubles.  Not thinking about that dumb magazine  - and the list we didn't get on. - (Bob moans)  And she mentioned the list.  ""Best Burgers on the Shore""? What a joke.  -Bob, it's just a list. Who cares? -I do!  -But you always say lists are stupid. -They are.  Even grocery lists? They remind us to buy pudding.  Dad, if the list is stupid, why do you want to be on it?  Because it would be good for business, Tina.  - Oh, yeah, you're a business. - But, of course,  every restaurant they picked is some new, trendy place.  And they all serve dumb, trendy sweet potato fries.  - Here we go. - Yeah, Tina, here we do go.  Sweet potato fries are too sweet,  and they're stupid, and I hate them.  Mom and her hot son like sweet potato fries.  I-I like them, too.  Have you tried regular fries, anyone?  Because they're delicious, and they have the perfect combination  -of crunch and saltiness, and-and-and - LINDA: Bob.  - Bob, calm down. - No, Dad, keep going.  - This is good stuff. - We know how you feel.  But just for the record, you asked me to order  -50 pounds of sweet potatoes, right? -Yes.  And we're gonna add sweet potato fries to the menu, right?  Yes, because apparently, we have to make these trendy fries  so the list people will like us.  LINDA: Okay. Hey, look we're here.  Bobby, you like bowling, right?  - (Bob grunts) - Or is that me? Crap, it's me.  Ugh, do all of the shoes have a used Kleenex in them? Just mine?  -Brag. -CLEM (over intercom): All right,  this is your favorite lane announcer here  to let the Belcher family know  they're cleared for takeoff on lane three.  Wait a second. I-I recognize that voice.  -Gary Busey? -CLEM: Watch your toes when you bowl.  Now here's some nasty rock and roll.  Oh, my God. That's Clem Clements.  Clem whoozit?  Clem Clements was the late night disc jockey on WIXU.  I-I used to listen to him when I'd work late in the restaurant,  back when we first opened  and things were a little touch and go.  - How far we've come. - Clem had this slogan  CLEM (over radio): This is Clem Clements coming at you  with no plan and no BS.  BOB: He talked a lot. He played, like, whole album sides.  He did the show his way,  - which was inspiring. - (yells)  Huh. So what's he doing working at a bowling alley?  - Maybe we should ask him. - I'm gonna do it.  - How-how do I look? - Like a sad man with one bowling shoe on.  And did you do something new with your butt?  Excuse me, Mr. Clements?  Uh, my name's Bob. I-I'm a big fan.  I never thought I'd see you here.  I never thought I'd be here.  Spraying bowling shoes, for God's sake.  But you spray them more than that, right?  - Just wondering. - So what happened?  Why aren't you on the radio anymore?  Eh, the industry went to crap.  First, they wanted me to play songs that were  - ""radio friendly."" - On the radio? (scoffs)  Yep. I refused.  Then they wanted me to give out prizes on the air.  I refused that, too.  But prizes are kind of fun.  Yeah. I never do anything unless there's a prize.  Kids, the kind of listeners that can be bought  with a T-shirt and bumper stickers  are the kind you don't want.  Oh (quietly): Stickers.  Anyway, they fired me and switched to a no-DJ format.  - No DJ? - Yeah, a computer-generated play-list  and prerecorded station I.D.'s.  - They call it the 'Tude. - Ugh.  After that, I got a job offer at a dinky little 40-watt station.  WOFD. But I've got my pride, so  - So here you are. - Here I am.  Look at us, being here.  Well, thanks for assigning a lane to us.  - Which lane was it again? - You're on lane three.  Oh. Uh, I know on the radio you didn't take requests,  -but could we request lane one? It's -No.  That's fine. We'll take any lane.  EDDIE 'TUDE (over radio): You're listening to the 'Tude.  Don't like it? Crack open a can of ""we don't care.""  Ugh, they fired Clem for this?  I thought they were switching to no DJs. Isn't that a DJ?  Yeah. He's a made-up character called Eddie 'Tude.  He has quite the attitude.  Oh, I just got the name.  He's obnoxious, and the music is awful.  But besides that, it's pretty good.  (sighs) So what can I get you?  I'll take a Burger of the Day and, uh,  some of those new sweet potato fries.  - Mm. - Bob  You like regular fries, right?  Get the regular fries.  My doctor said sweet potato fries  are better for you, actually.  Since when do you listen to your doctor?  -What? -Yogurt's better for you, too, Teddy.  Do you want yogurt fries?  No. I-I like sweet potato fries. What are yogurt fries?  Don't try to serve me yogurt fries.  Sorry, I can't do this, Lin.  Sweet potato fries are officially off the menu.  Okay, okay. Take it easy. It's just fries.  (sighs) You know what? I-I'm gonna call the bowling alley.  I-I want to bring Clem some lunch.  The universe sent him to that bowling alley,  and then it sent me to that bowling alley  so he could remind me to stick to my guns about fries.  Uh, permission to go with Dad to see how his freak-out goes?  All of you, go. Keep your dad calm.  Say things like, ""Dad, chill out,""  and, ""Tone it down, old man.""  How about ""It's all gravy, baby""?  I'll bring him a burger and some regular fries.  Yeah, you do that.  You think I could still get  some of those sweet potato fries, Lin?  (whispers): Wait till the scary man leaves.  Mm. Mm. Thanks, Bob.  You know, the station manager used to yell at me  for doing the show with my mouth full.  Yeah, but you did it anyway. It was cool and-and gross.  - Like neti pots. - He's also the guy  who fired me and told me nobody wants to listen to a DJ  who talks too much and plays whatever he wants.  Well, I want to listen. And I can't be the only one.  I mean, my kids want to listen. Right, kids?  I do. I like this guy's style.  I hope I've burned half as many bridges when I'm his age.  I want to listen, too.  (whispers): What's radio again?  Tell this stuff to my station manager.  You know what? I will. I-I'll call the station.  Eh, I don't think you can even reach  a real live person anymore.  Then I'll go there. I'll go right now.  Station manager's not there today.  Okay, tomorrow, then? I mean, I'm pretty fired up now,  but I could get fired up again tomorrow, probably.  - Sure you could, Dad. - Ask your doctor if it's safe  for you to get fired up two days in a row.  Know what? I'll go with you tomorrow.  Uh, r-really? Uh, great.  I want to see the look on Vance's face  when he meets a real live fan.  It'll be like this.  ""Turn off that fan! It's too windy in here!""  So you're just showing up at the radio station?  -Is that the plan? -Well, yeah, we'll march in there  and tell the station manager he made a mistake  throwing away something pure and raw  for something trendy and not raw.  And we'll get Clem his job back.  Probably not. But we can hope.  - Come on, kids. - Well, while you do that,  I'm gonna be back here pushing pie.  ""We sell pie now?"" I ask hopefully.  Yeah, we got to do something with all these sweet potatoes.  So many frickin' sweet potatoes, Bob.  I'm sorry. But I'm glad they're pies.  Sweet potatoes like to be pies.  They were born to be dessert.  All right, we get it. Go.  Tell the pies I'll be back. Wait for me. Wait for me!  Clem, hi.  Hey. Thanks for this, Bob. You're cool.  Oh, my God, Clem Clements just called me cool.  - You heard ""cool""? - I heard ""stool.""  That's a weird ice cream truck. No judgment.  Ugh. The 'Tude Cruiser.  It used to be for live broadcasts.  Now it's for giving away T-shirts at malls.  Ooh. I mean, grr, T-shirts at malls.  You know, we could just light it on fire and call it a day.  Dad, hear him out.  Uh, maybe we should just stick to the other plan.  Nuh-uh. No plan, no BS.  Right. I mean, our non-plan plan.  Let's, uh, just go inside?  Hey, Mort. You want a slice of sweet potato pie?  Ah, I don't know. What do you say, Teddy?  - Is it worth the calories? - It sure looks good.  Mm. (grunting, groaning)  - Huh. - Teddy?  I'm sorry, Linda. The pie is terrible.  What do you mean, ""terrible""?  I think it needs more sugar.  Sugar? I didn't add any sugar.  Sweet potatoes are already sweet. It's in the name.  Huh.  And I was out of cinnamon and a couple other things.  I improvised. Like jazz, but it's a pie.  Let me try.  I think it's (gagging)  It's not totally  I'm sorry, it's awful.  So, big deal. You messed up one pie.  Ten. I messed up ten pies.  - Oof. You messed up ten pies? - (moans)  Hey, on the bright side, maybe that's a record of some sort?  It's got to be, right? Look it up, Mort.  Pretending to look it up,  wishing I hadn't come in here today.  VANCE: So, let me get this straight, Clem.  You're rolling into the 'Tude with four randos,  three of whom I definitely suspect are children,  to tell me that I'm wrong?  - That's right. - And to take his job back.  Uh, yeah. Uh, we're-we're fans, and, um, we-we like Clem.  - Powerful. - And you are ?  Bob. I-I'm Bob.  You couldn't have done this over the phone, Bob?  Well, Clem said no one answers the phone here.  Uh, we answer the phone.  Yes, but there's a difficult-to-navigate menu  of automated options.  Going great, Dad. You got this.  - Uh, Vance, I-I know you just met me - Yes.  Louise, stop. I know you just met me, and this is, um,  weird, but please, hear me out.  Little advice um, usually, when people say ""hear me out ""  (grunts)  they follow it up with something coherent.  Ow.  - Yeah, fi - So, got to go now.  - Wait, I - Yeah, talking about you.  (sighs) I didn't rehearse what I was gonna say.  I-I didn't know I was gonna break into song.  - Yeah, that came out of nowhere. - Huh, look.  That's my old booth.  Wow. There it is.  Underwhelming. But in a great way?  Oh. Are-are we allowed to ?  Eh, who cares? They don't use it anymore.  Wow, it's just like I imagined it.  There's a microphone and a-a board with knobs.  - Good imagination, Dad. - PATRICK: Hi, Clem.  (shouts)  I-I thought you said they don't use the booth anymore, Clem.  They don't use the booth.  They use the engineer. That's Patrick.  He was the engineer for my show, and he could've left with me,  but he stuck around because he likes ""working for money.""  Mm. That voice. It really lights up the equalizers.  Nice to hear you again.  What's it like running the board for a fake DJ, Patrick?  Eddie 'Tude may be fake, but he's the number one  drive-time DJ in the market.  Successful but imaginary.  - Like Gene's friend Ken. - True. Hey!  I'll bet you miss being in that chair, huh?  Yep. Lot of memories.  Lot of blood, sweat and farts in that chair.  I'm getting mostly farts. Oh, wait, there's the sweat.  You must miss this.  Do you want a picture of yourself sitting in the chair,  - or-or is that dumb? - Huh.  Hey, do do you think I could sit in the chair?  Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.  Really? Great. Louise, get a picture of me leaning in  and holding the microphone like I'm about to say something cool.  (chuckles): I am so embarrassed for that microphone right now.  (Clem grunting)  BOB: Um Clem?  -What-what are you doing? -Just moving this couch over here.  Seeing how it looks blocking the door.  Can I have that mic for a second?  Oh, my God. You're-you're not  Sorry for this interruption  to your regularly scheduled fraud-cast.  This is Clem Clements, coming at you with no plan and no BS.  Patrick, don't you hit that button.  Folks, open up your ears for some weird.  - You with me, Bob? - Wha-what is happening?  Patrick, open the door. Open the door right now.  Patrick, don't. Look at me, Patrick.  - Patrick, look at me. - Say my name.  - CLEM: Patrick, say my name. - BOB: Oh, my God,  oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.  (laughing): Yes!  - We are live, people! - No. No, no, no, no.  Open the door. I am so serious right now.  Clem, he sounds so serious.  I-I should open the door.  Hey, listeners, that quavery voice you're hearing  is my friend Bob.  He's kind of the reason I'm talking to you today.  No, no, no. I Hi.  You got your offspring here, right, Bob?  - Tell everyone your names, kids. - Clem, listen.  I'm Gene, the boy with the golden voice.  - And golden ding-dong. - BOB: Gene!  -CLEM: And you? -I don't think we should be doing this,  but I always wanted to talk on the radio, so  'Sup? I'm Tina.  And I am a pillar of fire with hammer hands.  You can't see me. You can't tell me I'm not.  Okay, I-I'm opening the door.  Before you do that, Bob, can I have a word?  Patrick, dig up one of our old tracks.  Oh, oh, give us the mic.  Five minutes of fart sounds?  - Sure. Go nuts. - (blowing raspberry)  Don't open the door. This is what we wanted.  I got my job back.  This isn't getting your job back.  This is you barricading yourself in this room.  They're very different.  I thought we were a team.  But hey, you do what you got to do.  Me, I'm gonna plug my iPod into that console  and put it on shuffle.  And if some of my spoken-word poetry plays,  some of my spoken-word poetry plays.  (shuddering)  So, the animal shelter won't take the pies.  Figures. Probably a bunch of snobby poodles.  Oh, what are we gonna do with these things?  I don't know. Mm. I mean, they're really  they're not good pies.  Here, let me try this one.  - Oh, awful! Gross. - Mm. Ugh.  Pass the whipped cream, please.  - Hold on. Mm. Mm. - Oh. Mm.  - (both grunting repeatedly) - Little more.  (door opens, bells jingle)  -Hey, check it out. Bob's on the radio. -What?  CLEM (on radio): That sound you hear is not the world's longest drum solo.  It's a security guard pounding on the studio door.  BOB (on radio): Yeah, and he's mad.  - W-We could get arrested. - What? Bob.  GENE: Question Now can you play the world's longest drum solo?  CLEM: Cuing it up.  - Oh, my God! My babies! - (drum solo playing)  No one said anything about my new haircut !  CLEM: Before we blast these tunes to the moon,  this might be a good time to check in  with my old friend-gineer Patrick.  Used to be just us humans,  before the robot radio revolution.  How are the robots treating you, Patrick?  Mm, fair. Not many people work here now.  The company Christmas party is just me and Vance.  It takes all the fun out of Secret Santa.  Excuse me, Clem, where's your slide whistle sound effect,  in case a zinger comes to me later?  I would also like to request a record scratch  followed by a laser sound.  Normally, I'm not a sound effects guy,  but I'll do it this once.  (slide whistle, record scratch, laser, spanking)  (crying baby, sad trombone)  Crying baby into sad trombone?  Are you Mozart?  - (phone ringing) - Hello?  Patrick, it's Vance. Shut them down right now.  Don't you have a button for that?  - I do have a button. - Then push it.  Yeah, but if I push the button, they're gonna come in here  and also push the button,  which would undo my button pushing,  and we're just back to where we started.  Damn it, Patrick, you're getting too technical.  We are in deep doo-doo here.  It is code red over at corporate.  - Code red? Uh-oh. - Yeah. Now, I'd call the cops myself,  but corporate said I got to handle this quietly.  And I don't know how to handle this at all.  GENE: You're doing great.  Who is that? Patrick, tell me I'm not on the air.  - My fault. You're on the air. - Damn it!  But now we're not on the air, so you can say anything you want.  Okay, good. Clem, I don't know how to handle this,  and I feel like I'm gonna cry.  Oh, I'm so sorry, we were on the air.  No! They tricked me!  Bob's got his phone off. Oh, God.  Teddy, you brought one of the pies?  I thought maybe it would taste better in the truck.  - (radio tuning) - LINDA: Oh, where's the station?  Could you, uh, pass the there's a fork  in the glove compartment, glove compartment fork.  BOB (on radio): Clem, I think we can  - sign off now, right? - There's Bob!  Bob, Bob, get out of there! It's me, Linda!  Listen to your wife. We both love you very much.  Teddy, go, go faster.  BOB: Where are you going with this, Clem?  You're-you're not getting hired back at this station  after you hijacked it.  - ""Hijacked"" is a strong word. - Soft-jacked?  - Soft-jacked. - Guys.  Where I'm going with this is let's have some more fun  before they break the door down.  So sit back, we're gonna be here a while,  'cause that's a really serious door, which, by the way,  was gonna be the name of The Doors, but it sounded  - too serious. - First off, love it.  One question bathroom. Where should I go in this room?  - Oh. Maybe hold it? - So, that corner?  - Louise, no. - You got three other options.  Whatever we're doing, let's make a decision. Storm's a-coming.  The little girl goes out, you stay in the hallway.  - Do we have a deal? - Absolutely.  - Fellas, got to move this along. - Okay, I'm opening the door now.  - Great. Do it. - (both grunting)  Oh, boy.  (straining): I thought we had a deal.  (straining): We do have a deal.  - You're trying to get in. - No, I'm not.  It really seems like you are.  I don't know, maybe he just likes the way that feels.  Yes, exactly. He's right.  - Aha! I was trying to get in. - I knew it.  - Damn it. - I'm so sorry, I'm really sorry,  - and I got to go. - That's it, Clem.  Your little stunt is over, and let me tell you something else  The 'Tude is a hit, and you're just a moldy oldie  who does things weird.  -Geez. -Ouch. -Yikes.  I'll see you at the bowling alley, tomorrow,  for my son's birthday party. You know we're coming, right?  I-I think we confirmed?  LOUISE: I haven't found the bathroom,  but I found a bunch of paper cups.  Ah Not a good aim. We should go.  Clem, he-he didn't mean what he said.  I mean, he did. I don't know why I started that way.  He's right, though. I guess I'll, uh I'll see you around.  Kids, I forgot your names, but bye.  - Bye, radio man. - Clem, wait!  - Th-Th-The 'Tude Cruiser. - Yeah?  -You said you can broadcast from there. -Yeah?  Well, what if we borrowed it? Wh-Where are the keys?  - I have keys. - Patrick?  You quit in support of Clem?  You could say that, but really, I got fired.  Oh, sorry, buddy.  I was gonna quit anyway, in ten years.  I like your idea, Bob. Want to go for a ride?  Ready to roll, everybody?  - Yes, yes, yes! - Yeah!  Let's do this. Oh, wait, that's my neighbor's key.  I'm looking after her cat.  - Aw. - Let's do this.  - CLEM: So, what are we doing? - BOB: First, we get back  on the air, which means we have to park somewhere  - and set up, right, Patrick? - Exactly.  - CLEM: Then what? - Uh, then we open the phones  and talk to the people.  I bet you got through to a lot of them today.  -And they're gonna want Clem back? -Uh, yeah.  Uh, you know there are no phones in the 'Tude Cruiser, right?  Crap, really?  But you could hold a cell phone up to the mic.  So, give out my phone number over the radio?  Worried about stalkers? It's okay, you'll get one.  Where are we gonna park the 'Tude Cruiser?  How about at that restaurant over there?  And I'm not just saying that  because we missed lunch. Okay, I am.  Oh, my God. That place is on the list.  ""Best Burgers on the Shore.""  You carry that around?  Yeah, it's his super cool way  of showing how little he cares about it.  Patrick, this thing we're about to do,  - will it be loud? - Yes.  Loud enough to annoy trendy people trying to eat lunch?  - Probably. - Then we park there.  I don't get it.  They said Bob and the kids left already,  but the car's still here.  Whoa, there's signs of a struggle in there.  Nah, that's how it always looks.  Come on, back in the truck. Is there any pie left?  A little bit that I was gonna save for later,  but, uh, yeah, I mean, I guess you can have some.  I see a lot of sweet potato fries.  Don't believe the hype, people!  Save it for the airwaves, big guy.  So I used the restaurant Wi-Fi to access  the 'Tude transmitter site and hack the audio encoder.  How'd you do that? I'm hack-curious.  Maybe ""hack"" is a strong word. They never set up a password.  - I just logged on. - And we're back, folks.  Sorry for that rude interruption,  or should I say, ""'Tude interruption.""  Nice!  - They're back on the air. - Now what?  - Just drive. - And never look back?  - No, and find Bob. - We don't even know where he is.  Right, right. Okay, just drive, then.  (cell phone buzzing)  CLEM: The phone lines are really lighting up.  I mean, it's just the one line, but it's vibrating like crazy.  Dad has that thing set to shiatsu.  Put it on my back. Oh, wait, I just got another idea.  - Gene. - (cell phone beeps)  First caller who isn't Vance at the station.  Vance, stop calling. Stop it. I hate you.  - First caller, you're on. - ROBO-CALLER: Hello.  The reason for this call is to let you know  you're now eligible for interest rates  as low as six percent.  Whoa, Dad, congrats.  Does this mean one of us can go to college?  - (cell phone beeps) - Next caller. You're on the air.  LINDA (echoing): Oh, thank God, I got through!  - (echoing): Linda? - Bob.  Linda, turn down your radio.  I just want to say  Whoa, my voice sounds weird.  Turn down the radio, Linda.  (echoing): Oh, we got to turn down the radio.  (echoing stops): Linda, why are you calling?  We're kind of looking for Clem Clements fans right now.  Bob, where are you?  We're at an undisclosed location, but we might be near  one of the restaurants on the list.  The list? Oh, Bob, let it go.  Don't worry, Mom. He's handling it really well.  TINA: No, he's not, Mom.  He's shouting at people eating sweet potato fries.  Only that one guy, Tina, and that couple.  - I mean, a couple couples. - Bob, listen.  Trendy stuff is just trendy. So what?  You care about what you do.  (over speakers): And you're stubborn,  and sometimes that means not everyone's gonna like you,  but the people who like you really like you.  And that's who you do it for,  not some dumb list.  (sighs) Thanks, Linda. Uh, that's nice of you to say.  - Mmm. No sweat, baby. - Are you What are you eating?  EDDIE 'TUDE (on radio): T-T-T-T-Tude FM.  Cram this in your sound hole.  Crap, the 'Tude is back.  - Patrick, do your thing. - I can't.  They locked me out, which is fair.  (sighs) Well, I guess that's it.  (sighs) Sorry I dragged you into this,  but it sounds like you're doing all right.  I mean, you've got your loyal customers and your family.  Yeah, but you've got, um, well, you know  Right, I have, uh  Free bowling shoes?  Do you have a bow and arrow? That's something.  - (cell phone buzzing) - No.  Dad, your phone keeps buzzing.  Oh. Hello?  Y-Yeah, he's here.  - Is it for Clem? - Hello?  CALLER 1: Hey, Clem Clements?  - Yeah? - I was listening to you,  but then the 'Tude came back,  but then you came back, then the 'Tude came back.  Are you gonna come back or what?  I think we're done, buddy.  No, that sucks!  Wait, there's someone else calling. Hello?  CALLER 2: 'Tude stinks! Bring back Clem!  Oh, there's another call. Hello?  CALLER 3: Hey, Clem, it's Dan over at WOFD.  We talked a while back.  You know, our offer still stands.  - We love what you did today. - Whoa, hey, Dan.  I got to say, right now it's nice to be appreciated.  I tell you what, I will work for you  if you hire Patrick as my engineer.  That is great news!  The shift we have right now is midnight to 8:00 a.m.  -We'll be there. -Oh, that's when I do my sleeping.  (siren wailing)  Uh, sorry, caller. Uh, do you guys hear that?  - Uh-oh. - Time to move. - What should we do?  Push this sucker off the pier?  - Maybe. - Maybe not.  - Maybe just return it. - Oh, boo.  Regular fries   Are the best french fries   Regular fries   They're just very good fries   Sweet potato fries   Are overrated   Baby   You've got to have reg   You've got to have regular fries   Regular fries   They're the best french fries   Regular fries   They're just very, very, very good fries   Sweet potato fries   They're overrated, baby   You've got to have regular"
"1  TINA: I wonder why we're all assembled here today?  I hope we're about to enter the Hunger Games,  'cause I'm starving.  Maybe they're gonna tell us this is all a joke.  (clears throat) Who's ready to have a little fun?  When I say ""announce,"" you say ""ments.""  Announcements. Aah, I messed that up.  Anyway, here's your P.E. instructor, Coach Blevins.  This Friday, every single student  at Wagstaff will be participating  in our annual fourth through eighth grade mandatory mile run.  -(students gasp) - What-What's happening?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Every student is required to run  unless you have a real doctor's note,  not a very convincing fake one  that any intelligent person would fall for.  We'll be running the same route as last year  on the sidewalk outside of school property.  Teachers will be placed around the route  here, here, here and here to make sure you don't get lost  or taken or something worse I'm not thinking of.  This dot on the map is me.  But I'll be scooting about on my adult scooter  to inspire while you perspire.  Okay.  Now let's move on to the booger wall.  Mr. Branca is scraping and painting today,  so if you want a picture of yourself with it  or if you want to take any of your boogers home,  you have two hours.  We have to run? A mile?  And it's mandatory?!  What a bunch of crap!  Well, listen, I can't run the mile!  - Okay? - If I run a mile, I will die!  A mile is like five miles  -if I run a mile with these little legs! -(inhales)  Tell me about it. (exhales)  - Okay, you want a hit? - Nah, I'm good.  I want to stay angry.  Hey, Jimmy Jr. I was thinking it could be cool  if we ran the mile together this year.  (laughs): W-Wait, you?  - Run with me? - Uh, yeah.  - Doesn't that sound kind of fun? -(laughs) Sorry, Tina.  But have you seen how fast I run?  I-I guess? Um, I just thought it-it could be a nice way  -to spend time - Well, I mean,  I'm gonna try and break nine minutes, so  I could just try to run with you?  Maybe we could hang out after the mile when you finish  and I've already been doing something else  for, like, two or three minutes.  Okay, you know what, Jimmy Jr.? I'm not gonna run with you.  - Yeah, I know, Tina. - I'm gonna beat you.  (laughs) That's crazy.  You better start training, Jimmy Jr.,  'cause Mama's comin' for you.  I'm Mama in this scenario.  So, how are we getting out of it this time?  I don't know. I think Coach Blevins finally realized  Dr. Good-doctor isn't a real doctor.  ""Gene and Alex both need constant contact  ""with their behinds on a surface to realign their butt-cheeks.  Love, Dr. Good-doctor.""  I can't run a whole mile in a row.  What do they think I am, a car?  (gasps) It's on again.  ANNOUNCER: This weekend at the Wharf Arts Center,  Cake is back.  It's so beautiful.  And this time, they're gonna patty-cake your breath away.  (gasps) It did.  It just caked my breath away.  - Tickets on sale now. - So, are you going?  - I wish. - Tickets are so expensive.  How much could they be?  I was just checking this morning  on the Wharf Arts Center website.  Here, look.  Ooh. That is not cheap.  Wait, look. It says this Friday,  they're gonna release discounted tickets at 11:00 a.m.  You can get them over the phone.  Oh, my God. I-If we call right at 11:00,  maybe we'll get lucky.  We're great at calling places at certain times.  Like how I call Ginger every day at 5:15,  and she says, ""Call me later,"" and then I forget.  TINA: Stupid Jimmy Jr.  Thinks I can't keep up with him.  (singsongy): Well, at least after we run the mile,  we can all go get a free scoop of ice cream.  What are you talking about?  Friday is free scoop day at Moo's Clues.  I've been saving up my money for it for weeks.  Just kidding. It's free,  so I won't need any money. (laughs)  I've always wanted to go to free scoop day.  Don't even bother. Let me paint a picture.  Last year. Free scoop day.  -(school bell ringing) - It was a beautiful afternoon,  the perfect kind of afternoon for eating   - COURTNEY: Ice cream. - GENE: Thank you, Courtney.  - COURTNEY: Mm-hmm. - GENE: But by the time  school got out and we arrived at Moo's Clues,  the line was down the block.  When we finally got to the counter,  the only flavor left was  Rum Raisin Sorbet.  ALEX: Dear Lord.  No! Why?!  The only way I'd go to free scoop day  would be to somehow go during school,  which is impossible.  Wait, Gene. That's a great idea.  We could go during the mile. We'd have no lines  and all the flavors to choose from.  How would we go during the mile?  I mean, Coach Blevins showed us the map.  This is school. We start running the race  with everyone else here.  Not liking the plan so far.  Shush, shush, shush. The morning of the race,  we could hide bikes under the bushes  where no teachers are stationed here.  Then, while all the other kids are running this way,  we'd just have to ride two blocks off route to Moo's Clues,  eat our free ice cream, get back, stash our bikes,  blend in with the other runners, and finish the mile.  Oh, my God, I'm gonna pass out. That's a great plan!  Mm, I don't know if there's enough time to do all of that.  Yeah, last year, some eighth grader ran it  in, like, seven minutes.  We can't do all that in seven minutes.  - That's cuckoo. - No.  We're gonna blend in with the back of the pack.  Who runs the slowest mile?  I think Large Tommy ran it in, like, 20 minutes.  Oh, right, 'cause he had to repeat the fourth grade.  I get it. Pick a grade you like and stick with it.  Okay, so, we'll have about 20 minutes.  It's tight, but we could pull it off.  Like my Spanx.  All we have to do is finish before he does.  But what if Tommy runs it faster this year?  Well, we could track him.  Okay. (scoffs) We'll use the trackers we got  -when we were in the CIA. - No, no, no.  My dad bought our cat a GPS collar  so he could keep track of her.  That little happy cat is Susan.  Aw.  If we could somehow put the collar on Large Tommy,  then we'd know exactly when we'd need to finish the race by.  Wow. Courtney, I'm impressed.  Guys, this plan sounds a little risky.  Well, there's no way I could run a whole mile.  So I say we take the risk and we do the ice cream plan.  All right, we're doing this.  Tina, are you in? You want ice cream?  No ice cream for me.  I'm just gonna have a double scoop  of beating Jimmy Jr.'s ass into the asphalt.  Suit yourself, sis.  'Kay, Friday morning, we all leave for school early,  we hide our bikes, and then we eat  any flavor of free ice cream we choose.  And if we have time, we take all of the Rum Raisin Sorbet  out of that store and burn it.  - Uh, I like Rum Raisin Sorbet, actually. - Rudy!  Get some rest, phone. You have a big day tomorrow.  You're gonna get us tickets  to see Cake Two: Cake My Breath Away.  (high-pitched): Don't worry, I got this, Bob.  (normal voice): I know you do, B.P.  (high-pitched): What's B.P.?  (normal voice): ""Bob's phone."" Your nickname.  Do you love it? No.  What do you want to be named? Phil.  Stop talking to your phone, Bob. Go to sleep.  One second. You're so old, but I believe in you.  - Bob, go to sleep! - Okay. I love you.  Are you talking to me or to your phone?  Uh, y-you ?  You're lookin' good on that big-girl bike, Louise.  Thank you.  I mean, I'm being nice. But good effort.  All right, we're here.  Ah, dang. I tried to skid out, but it didn't work.  Man, that would have been cool.  -(bell ringing) - Ah, ring, ring. I'm here.  Hey, Courtney. You don't have to say ""ring, ring""  and ring your bell.  I also don't have to say ""tinkle""  when I'm tinkling, but I do.  Oh, my God. All right, let's stash our bikes.  How's everybody feeling?  - Pumped. - So good.  - Scared. - Alex, you have to bury that fear.  One slip-up, and you could endanger the mission.  We live by the cone or we die by the cone!  I think they also have cups.  - So, are we cool? - Yeah.  - Now, give me a hug. - On it.  Wait, a quick one or, like, uh, what are we doing?  Hug me like you got lost at an amusement park,  and you just found your mommy.  - I'll do a hug. - Get in here, girl!  - Aw - I want a hug.  Bring it in, Rudy.  You're really missin' out, Louise.  Oh, no, I'm-I'm not.  Good morning, Wagstaffians.  - In a minute, you will begin - Oh, crap, I forgot my hard hat.  Why do you need a hard hat?  'Cause I'm gonna demolish you.  - All right, Courtney, give me the tracker. - Here you go.  Geez, I hope Susan doesn't pick today to run away.  That'd be terrible timing on her part.  You don't think she'll run away, do you?  Susan? No.  Guys, look. Tommy has a hydration pack.  We can hide the cat collar in there.  I say we stick with the original plan  and tell him it's a cool anklet.  Gene, no. I'm moving in.  - What's up? - Uh, nothing.  Your backpack is unzipped. There ya go.  What do you, uh, have to drink back there?  Water. Actually, it's milk.  Done. Courtney, do we have a signal?  - Check. - All right.  Now we just have to get to the finish line  before that happy little cat face does.  -(door bells jingle) - Hi, Teddy!  We're about to call and try to get tickets for Cake.  Hey, I could help. I got a phone.  Uh, yeah. Thanks, Teddy.  That's what best friends are for.  Uh, let's-let's see if you get through.  Okay, we have one minute till the lines open.  This is the number for the Wharf Arts Center.  - How-How's your battery? - Great.  I got a mighty 23%.  Huh, that's not Crap, it's time. Dial. Dial!  Wait, I can't read your writing. Is that an eight or a boob?  That's an eight, Lin. Why would it be a boob?  Ju-Just dial.  - On your mark. Get set -(whistle blows)  Go! Go! Go!  Go! Run. Come on.  (panting): See ya later, Tina-gator!  Hmm. I might've started a little too hot. (straining)  It's hard to talk and run. Stop making me talk, Tina!  TINA: Oh, my God. Jimmy Jr. is a terrible runner.  GENE: Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.  All right, we just have to make it to the bushes.  This already feels like a lot of running.  Just use your thing already, Rudy.  You mean my booster rocket?  (inhales sharply) Blastoff.  Hello? Hi. Is anyone there?  No. Just the hold recording started over.  I know, I keep thinking a real person is picking up.  (door bells jingle)  Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burgers. What-what can I get you?  Yeah, I'll take a burger of the day.  Oh, wait, hold on. Hello? Oh, still on hold.  - Uh, what can I get you? - A burger of the day.  Whoa, whoa, wait, hold on. Hello? Oh. Still on hold.  Uh, sorry. Wha-What can I  I'm sorry, is there someone else who could take my order, maybe?  Hi. I can help you. What would you like?  - Yeah, I'll have a burger of - Wait, hold on.  - Oh, my God. - Hello? Still on hold.  - What can I get ya? - You know what? I-I'll come back.  What's the matter? You're not hungry?  What's that guy's problem?  (panting): Just give up now, Tina!  TINA: Wow. I actually feel kind of bad for him.  Maybe I should let him win.  Ah, screw it. I'm gonna take him.  Ha! You're only in front of me 'cause I let you be.  Okay, I really got to stop talking.  Guys, we're here.  Once he gets a little further out of sight,  we'll grab our bikes and ride.  And then we'll grab our ice cream and licky, licky,  -licky, licky, licky. - All right,  let's move!  I can already taste the ice cream, and also my sweat.  I really hope my cat doesn't run away today.  - What is going on with you? -(chain rattling)  No. No! Guys, wait! Wait!  I can still catch them.  I just have to put my bike chain back on. Aah!  No, they're getting away! Stay calm. Stay calm.  Crap, I have to hide my bike.  Uh, maybe he won't notice me.  FROND (over megaphone): Gene Belcher! What are you doing?  I'm just running slowly by myself.  Nothing suspicious!  You're a little off course. Come back this way.  Oh, no. We lost Gene.  He's gonna die out there.  Oh, God. Ugh!  I can't believe I actually have to do this.  Jackie Joyner-Kersee, give me strength!  Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.  -(Gene grunting, panting) - You can do it!  You just have three-quarters of a mile left!  Which is a lot, but don't think about that.  We can't just leave him out there, we're not animals.  Guys, Tommy just made the first turn.  Damn it!  We have to keep moving.  If we go back, nobody gets ice cream.  If we go forward, we get ice cream.  I say we go forward. For Gene.  No, how-how is that for Gene?  It's what he would have wanted, Rudy.  I say we keep going. For Gene.  I also want ice cream. For Gene.  - For Gene! - For Gene.  I feel like we're not doing it for Gene,  -but if - We're doing it for Gene!  Okay. Fine.  Just because you're in last place  doesn't mean you're slower than everyone else.  And now that I've inspired you,  I'm gonna scoot to the finish line athletically.  (panting): No shame in taking a break to walk, Tina.  Why don't you come up here and tell me that, Slow Stuff.  I don't (panting) want to.  Hey, hey. Mine's ringing.  Hello? Can you hear me?  I-I think we got a bad connection.  Teddy, go by the window. That's the good spot.  - Hello? No, it's worse here. - Oh, my God, Teddy.  Don't let the call drop.  - Uh, go to higher ground. - O-Okay.  - Stand on a booth. - It's a little better.  Wait, no, I-I'm gonna go higher.  Why did you pick a booth with a customer?  I don't know. Uh, sorry, ma'am. Keep eating.  Uh, hi. Hi. Can you hear me? Great. Hi.  What show am I calling about? What show am I call ?  - Cake, Teddy. It's called Cake! - Cake.  Sure, I'd be interested in hearing about all your shows  in the upcoming Wharf Arts Center season.  - The-the tickets, Teddy. - Wow.  Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, huh?  How do they get the cat to do that?  Get the tickets, Teddy.  All right. No, he just wants to see Cake.  Do you still have discounted tickets?  You do? That's great.  Okay, so let me get two of those, please.  Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh, no.  - What happened? - Eh, my phone just ran out of batteries.  What the heck? I was at three percent  when I started the call.  Oh, my God, Teddy.  (Louise sighs)  We made it. We actually made it.  - Today I become a man. - Every flavor.  There's no line and they have every flavor.  Whoa, they have vanilla.  Hello Vanessa.  Uh, I'll have your largest and free-est scoop  of Ripple Fudge Caramel Delight, please.  And could you throw in a scoop of Raspberry Rumble on top?  Also for free.  You get one scoop. Standard size.  Don't come back. I'll recognize you.  I'll recognize all of you, got it?  Yup. Got it. One scoop, sounds great.  -(panting, gasps) - Ah!  Sorry, I didn't see you.  I-I'm just gonna take a little break real quick.  - No. You can't stop. - What? Why?  It hurts so bad if you stop moving.  It's like your bones turn into nails  and your blood turns into pain.  Oh, God. And my shoe's untied.  - Don't stop. - Eh, fine.  Let me get a sip of that  Mmm, milk.  JIMMY JR.: Had enough yet, Tina?  The back of your head looks exhausted.  Hey, Jimmy Jr., maybe less running your mouth  and more running your feet, huh?  BOB: Pick up, pick up, pick up.  - Hello. Hi. - Did you get through?  Yes. I'm calling for the discounted tickets for Cake Two.  Oh. Okay. Crap.  I'm sorry, Bobby. They just sold the last two.  (sighs deeply)  Eh Oh, well.  There's nothing any of us could have done. (sighs)  - You. - What, me?  - You. - All right.  Uh, Teddy, it was good to see you. Time to go, hon.  We had the tickets! We had them!  Are you saying this is my fault?!  Yes! Who doesn't charge their phone, Teddy?!  I did! It only charges to 23%.  Then bring a charger, you idiot!  Okay, calm down, fellas. It's just a show.  Middle of the day and your phone's at 23%?  - Bob stop. - What am I supposed to do?  - Replace my phone every ten years? - Yes!  Do me a favor and don't tell me how to live my life!  I'm-I'm-I'm leaving.  - Good! Great! - Yeah, I'm leaving.  - That's great, leave! - I'm leaving.  I hope your car isn't out of batteries.  Yeah, cars don't have batteries, idiot.  They run on gas. And batteries.  Damn it.  Eat faster, people.  I mean, savor it but speed it up.  Oh! Pushin' through the brain freeze.  Licky, licky, licky, licky, licky.  - Like Gene said. You remember? - Yeah.  - Licky, licky, licky, licky. - Man, this just doesn't feel  -that great without him. - Licky, licky, licky, licky.  - Also, Courtney, stop doing that. - Ugh.  I feel mostly fine,  but, ugh, I see your point. Hang on.  Everybody, stop eating. Stop!  We left Gene behind but that doesn't mean  we have to leave his free scoop behind.  She's not gonna give us another scoop, Louise.  That's right. But we can give him our scoops.  What are you talking about?  Quick, come put whatever you haven't eaten into my cone.  We're bringing Gene back a scoop of our leftovers.  Well, I guess Gene needs it more than I do. Fine.  That's the spirit. Now plop it on in here, people.  - Wait, wait, guys. - What?  Tommy only has a couple blocks left.  Crap. Let's move.  The faster we go, the faster we get there.  I'm in no mood for your elaborate riddles.  I can't believe you've done this before.  I mean, they make us do it,  but it does feel really good to finish.  Tommy, you inspirational bastard.  I'm riding with one hand. I'm riding with one hand!  Someone's fishing for a compliment. Good job, Louise.  - Look, I see them. - LOUISE: Gene!  Gene, we're back.  Look at me. I'm running!  And I think I have a chance  - of finishing this thing! - We brought you a scoop.  Just stop so we can stash our bikes and hand it to you.  I can't stop!  Well, I'm gonna fall off my bike.  I'm riding with one freakin' hand, just take it!  Fine! Ugh, I really want to stop and eat this,  (panting): but I'm gonna keep running.  (horn honking)  Susan! Susan, where are you, sweetie? Susan!  Oh, no. Guys, it's my dad. He has the cat tracker  - on his phone, too. - What?  Courtney, it's Susan.  I'm desperately seeking Susan.  I followed the tracker here. W-Wait, why are you on a bike?  Susan's fine, Daddy. Just go home.  I will not go home. Susan is close.  Wait, she's moving further away.  Very slowly?  Is she in that boy's backpack?  Gene and Gene's friend, stop right now.  - He made us stop running. - Ow!  I can't feel my bones, but it hurts!  Daddy, what did you do to them?  Nothing, but I'm going to open this one's pack.  Susan, Daddy's here.  What is going on? Why-why are you on bikes?  Gene Belcher, where did you get that ice cream cone?  - Uh - Wait, what the heck?  - I need to find Susan. - Who is Susan?  - My cat! - Oh, God, no.  Gene, you need to stand up and stop eating that ice cream.  - I wasn't eating it, and I can't get up. - Why not?  Because I can't feel my legs because I was running.  I was actually running.  Someone needs to explain what's going on here.  Courtney, you need to speak up right now.  Daddy, Susan is fine. She's at home.  I just borrowed her collar for something.  Oh, good. Oh, boy.  So Mr. Wheeler's cat has been located.  Now would anyone like to explain  just what's going on with this whole situation?  Tina, I'm sorry, okay?  I should have just run with you.  I-I got too competitive.  Yeah, you were a jerk about it.  Well, if it's not too late, I-I'd like to  - Kiss? - What? No.  Run the rest of the mile with you.  That sounds nice. All right, I'm slowing down.  (panting): Uh, yeah. Like I said, I'm sorry.  - Wait, are you speeding up? - (grunting)  - No. - Yeah, you are. Stop it.  - You're speeding up. - I'm not speeding up.  Are you still trying to beat me?  No! No, you must be slowing down because you're tired.  (both grunting)  - Yes! - (shouts)  Ah, dang it!  - You made me do that, Jimmy Jr. - I'm sorry.  - I don't forgive you. - I hurt so much.  I got to stretch out my quads and hammies.  Okay, I forgive you. I'll stretch you out.  Glutes, too. Let's start with those.  Since no one will talk,  you will all be redoing the mile tomorrow.  After I check with Principal Spoors  to confirm I have that authority.  Well, guys, we had a good run.  I mean, we didn't actually run, but you know what I mean.  We almost pulled it off.  (sighs) We'll do the stupid mile.  I know. You don't have a choice.  I'm telling you you're doing it.  But Gene shouldn't have to.  That guy ran his butt off today.  Wait, where is Gene?  Oh, look. He's doing it.  - LOUISE: Gene! Whoa. - He's actually doing it.  Got to finish, got to finish.  FROND: Gene, get back here!  You'll have to catch me, Mr. Frond!  Gonna finish! Gonna finish! Gonna finish!  I did it! I did it!  I just ran a freakin' mile! Tommy, we did it!  No, Gene, we did it.  - That's what I said. - Oh.  Okay, fine, Gene doesn't have to run tomorrow.  But everyone else does.  Again, if I have the authority to make you do that.  And now I'm gonna eat this scoop.  It was not free. I earned this.  Licky, licky, licky, licky, licky.  Whoa! What flavor is this?  Cheer up, Bobby. Maybe we can go see something else  at the Wharf Arts Center.  I-It's okay. I-I'll be fine.  - I-I might have gotten a little worked up, huh? -(door bells jingle)  Uh, I've been sitting in my truck outside.  Yeah. Well, look, I just want to say  I-I'm sorry I got upset at you.  - I-I just really wanted to see - No, no, no, no, no.  Eh. Go on, what were you saying?  I was about I was in the middle of apologizing,  -but you cut me off. - No. W-What? You go ahead.  - I-I didn't mean to - No, I know I can go ahead  - No, go ahead and you apologize. - So now you're telling me to go ahead,  because I was in the  No, just go ahead. You wanted to say something  You can't even let someone apologize!  Get out, Teddy! Go back in your truck!  You know what, that's great. That's great.  That's the way this day should end.  Wait, Teddy, stop. I-I'm sorry.  I'm just a little worked up, still.  Yeah, well, it turns out  - I had a phone charger in my truck. - That's great.  And I had a voice mail from the Wharf Arts Center.  You did?  Yeah. They called back with caller I.D. and they said  they set aside two tickets to Cake for you.  - What? That's incredible. - Yep.  They said I just had to call back in the next five minutes.  - Did-did you call back? - I wanted to tell you first.  - Teddy, please call back! - Right. No, yeah.  Right now. Right. I'll call back.  Hello. Yes, this is Teddy, the one that you called.  Right. Yes, that's my Yep, you called me. Right.  How are you doing? Eh.  Hey, I got to ask, what is that accent?  Is it Jamaican, or Scottish?  - Teddy. - Ted-Teddy.  Hey, I should probably just get those tickets.  So, if I could go Hello? Hello?  Hello? Bobby, can I borrow your phone real quick?  Cake  -(rhythmic clapping)  Come on   (rhythmic grunting)  (clapping continues)    (grunting continues)  Yeah   (grunting, clapping continues)  Cake!"
"1  All bow to Gene-eesi,  Toilet King of the House Belcher.  First of his name, Pincher of Loafs.  - Gene, please get off. - Oh, boo.  Wow, this is a lot of toilet paper.  - Did we maybe get too much? - No matter how much we order,  - we always seem to run out. - Yeah, it's almost like people  are just flushing this stuff down the toilet.  Teddy, how's it going with the dishwasher?  - Not great, Bob! - He's fine.  Well, you guys are gonna have to finish unpacking this  without me, 'cause I got to get to my PTA meeting.  Got some great ideas. I think Joanne is gonna love 'em!  - Who's Joanne? - The PTA president.  And the person I want to be when I grow up.  I thought you wanted to be Janet Jackson when you grow up.  We both do.  Last month, one of the other parents  came up with an after-school tutoring program.  She called it ""Real Punks Don't Flunk.""  Joanne took her out to breakfast to talk it over,  and the next thing you know, all the punks are getting A's.  Ugh. If I could just go to one breakfast with Joanne.  Can you imagine?  Let me try. Oh, yeah, that's nice.  Eh, too bad it's all about to go down the tubes  'cause of Colleen Caviello.  She's running for treasurer because Ray Mendoza  bought a houseboat, and he's gonna boat-school his kids.  Aw! I really don't want Colleen on the board.  She's gonna take all the fun out of fun-raising.  You know it's ""fund-raising,"" right, Lin? Not ""fun-raising.""  (forced chuckling): Yeah  everybody knows that.  Anyway, I'll see you later, crocodiles.  (Teddy grunting angrily)  Don't use the dishwasher yet, Bob.  Still fixing it.  Counterpoint. You fixed it.  I'm gonna run to the hardware store.  Ugh. How long is it gonna take?  We really need that dishwasher to be working.  We wash dishes here? I've just been putting them outside.  - What? - It's right down the street.  Kim & Son's Hardware? Family business?  They give me the ""contractor's discount.""  Huh. I usually just go to Fix-It Depot.  Fix-It Depot? That's fine  If you want to crush the little guy.  I am not crushing anyone, Teddy.  They just have everything there.  Like vices you can use to crush the heart of a family business?  Teddy, you know we're a family business.  Are you? Then why don't you act like a family business  - for once in your life! - Yeah!  Hey, why don't you come with me?  We'll be back in, like, ten minutes.  Kids, you want to take a little break  and go to the hardware store with Teddy?  He seems like he's doing well.  Sure. Kids love hardware stores.  Can we go to the laundromat, too?  Yay. Errands.    All in favor?  All opposed?  Looks like cookies beat out brownies  as the snack at our next meeting!  Congrats, Beth. We know how passionate  you are about those cookies.  Look at Joanne go.  I know. She's amazing.  Okay. As you all read in my e-mail,  we have a fund-raiser coming up  for seventh grade science kits!  Spirit fingers!  Aw. I love spirit fingers.  It's like typing a quiet message that says, ""Yay!""  Now, we don't have a theme yet,  so I hope you all came with some fun ideas.  Oh! Ooh! Ooh!  Linda. Yeah, let's hear it, girl.  Um, my idea for the theme is ""Surfin' PTA.""  - Ooh! - Get a surf deejay.  Someone could dress up like a shark  - and serve Shark-donnay. - Stop it.  And we could even cover the floor with sand.  You know, 'cause sand's at the beach.  - JOANNE: Yeah! - Can I say something?  (with clenched teeth): I wasn't finished, Colleen.  Uh, anyway, spirit fingers. Okay, I'm done.  For those of you who don't know me, hi, I'm Colleen Caviello.  I'm running for PTA treasurer. And I just want to say,  I don't think that Linda has thought through how expensive  - her idea would be. - Huh!  All that stuff she wants would put us at $45 a head,  - 200 people that's - A hundred fifty  - $9,000. - $9,000.  So maybe let's keep brainstorming, I don't know.  Hey, you know what, I got a spirit finger for you, Colleen.  Okay, that's not how we use spirit fingers.  Let's circle back to the fund-raiser in our next meeting.  Moving along on the agenda, let's talk about  replacing the dead shrubbery in front of the school.  Or maybe just painting it green.  Ooh. There's Danny.  He's the owner's son. (chuckles)  - Hi, Danny! - Hey, Todd.  That's Danny. He calls me Todd sometimes.  Dad, can we go explore,  away from this slightly sad conversation?  - Fine. - It's hammer time!  Hey, Mr. Kim! This is my friend Bob.  - Bob, Mr. Kim. - Uh, hello. Hi.  Bob's never been to a hardware store before.  - First time. - I-I actually, I have been  - I have - (Teddy laughs)  He doesn't know what any of this stuff is.  I-I know what it all is, Teddy.  Anyway, we're looking for an inlet valve  - for a dishwasher. - That's, uh, aisle one.  Great. I'll go get it.  It's a nice place you have here.  All the aisles.  Uh, what happened? Did your, uh, did your bird fly away?  (chuckles awkwardly)  (groans)  - Oh, no. - Hey.  He looked upset. What'd you say?  Teddy, please don't tell me his bird just flew away.  - His bird just flew away. - Are you serious?  I just made a joke about his bird flying away.  That's not a good joke, Bob. Mr. Kim loved that parrot.  Oh, my God, I feel horrible.  Dad, can we get this? It makes underwater fart sounds.  - Gene. - (imitates underwater farting)  See?  - You okay, Dad? - Uh, I think I just broke  an old man's heart.  - Is the old man you? - No. Another old man, Tina.  Way to go, Bob!  (sighs) Well, let's just go home, I guess.  Wait. What about the pipe?  You can get it, but this counts for everyone's birthday.  - Yes! - That's fair.  We own this now!  (Linda muttering angrily)  Hi, Lin. Uh, is everything okay?  Oh, everything's fine.  Colleen Caviello was as Colleen as ever.  In fact, they should call her Colleen Cavi-hell-no.  - (phone rings) - Pretty cool name, to be honest.  Bob's Burgers. We're a restaurant.  - Tina. - Yeah, she's here.  - Mom, it's for you. It's Joanne. - Really?  Bob, how do I look? Do I look okay?  -You look, uh, great. -Shush, shush, shush. I'm on the phone.  Hel Hello?  Hi, Linda. I hope I'm not catching you  at a bad time.  No, I-I was just, uh, organizing  uh, my, uh, stool samples.  - Hmm. - Uh, and I'm done.  Well, I was calling to let you know that  -I loved all your fun ideas today. -You did?  Why don't you and I have breakfast tomorrow and talk?  (gasps) Breakfast?  Uh, yeah, I'm free. Free as a tree!  Great! Let's say 10:00 a.m. at the Muffin Top?  Yeah, I'll see you then.  PTA, get ready for Me-T-A!  Thanks for having breakfast with me, Linda.  Of course! Ah, I've been wanting to get more involved.  -Oh, and I love your PTA pendant! -Oh, thank you.  You can't spell ""pendant"" without PTA!  - (laughs) - Right?  You're so fun, Linda.  - I was telling Bear about you. - Who's Bear?  Oh, that's my husband, Barry.  I call him Bear, and he calls me Jo-Jo.  Aw. I call my husband Bob-itty Bob-itty Bob-itty.  In my head. Whenever he walks by.  Anyway, I was telling him that we need to find better ways  to use you in the PTA.  Have you ever considered joining the board?  I mean, I'd love to, but with Colleen running  to be the new treasurer, I'd rather just sit this one out.  (groans) Colleen.  I mean, she is the only person running,  and yeah, she has an accounting background,  but that's not everything.  I think someone like you would be a better fit.  Me? No  Yeah! Who needs numbers?  You're the expert in fun-bers.  Well, I feel flattered, plus happy divided by gassy.  Ah, why'd I get the bran muffin?  But me? Treasurer? I dunno.  - Here, let me get this. - Oh, no, no, Linda.  This is paid for by the official PTA credit card.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, Joanne.  You know, for the rest of the day, I'm going around  to local businesses collecting items for the auction.  You're welcome to join me.  I'm in. Ah, let me call my husband  and let him know he's gotta flip his own meat today.  Okay, I get it.  You like Joanne more than us.  It's fine. Uh, bye.  - Ready, Gene? - Of course I'm ready.  This is the most important moment of my life.  Okay. Pouring the ketchup now.  Ah  Give it about an hour.  - Hi, Teddy. - Hi, Bob.  Just got back from the hardware store.  Did you send Mr. Kim flowers?  Yeah, I did.  - Why would you do that? - Wait, w-what do you mean?  You sent a bouquet of Birds of Paradise  to a guy who just lost his bird?  Is that some kind of sick prank?  That's what they sent? I just told them  to pick out the most expensive flowers  from their cheap section.  Guess what? 'Cause of your bird flowers  I lost my contractor's discount.  I just paid full price for this sandpaper.  Thanks a lot, Bob. You owe me $1.20.  What are you gonna do now, Dad?  Uh nothing. I'm gonna do nothing.  So, what? That's it? We're just never going back  to Kim and Son's Hardware ever again?  There are aisles and aisles of pipes  that we will never play with because of you.  You can fix this, Dad.  Do you wanna spend the rest of your life knowing  that sweet old Mr. Kim thinks you're a monster?  - Not really. - I didn't think you were  a monster until I saw you eating yogurt that one time.  It's time for ""Operation: Make Mr. Kim Not Hate Bob.""  -Who's in? - I am. - Me, too.  (sighs) All right, fine.  -Yay! -Yes. -Nice.  But let's please, just not do anything  to make him more upset.  Dad, do we look like people who make bad decisions?  The ketchup is arriving! (gulping)  WINE SHOP MANAGER: Hey, Joanne.  I have the basket  for your fundraiser ready to go.  Oh. Four bottles?  Is that what we agreed on?  Well, at first we said two,  but then you talked me up to four, remember?  (sighs) Here's the thing, I wouldn't ask  for these bottles if this was about me.  But this is about the children.  This is about science.  This is about those three special letters  that make the world a better place.  - S-E-X? - No, Linda. PTA.  - Oh, right. - So  Give what you can.  Dammit, Joanne and other lady.  I'll-I'll give you eight bottles.  - Oh, great. - And I'll throw in this magnet  that says ""Wine Time."" For the kids.  Can we get some wine, have a hella fine time   Can we get some more stuff?   I can never get enough   I'm with the PTA   Let me show you the way   You know you wanna   You know you should   You want to donate   It feels so good   -  I'm with the PTA  -  Give it up, give it up   So who's gonna pay?  Give it up, give it up   I'm with the PTA   Give it up, give it up   Everybody donate   I'm with the PTA   Give it up, give it up   So who's gonna pay?   Give it up, give it up   I'm with the PTA.   Okay, Dad, we finished the flyer to find Mr. Kim's bird.  I-I-It's good. My only question is,  why did you draw the bird with a top hat?  Because he's a bird.  And talk to me about the roller skates, and the fart cloud?  It propels him forward.  Okay, you've never made a flyer, have you, Dad?  Huh. Let's take another crack at this.  We need something less like this.  Bigger fart cloud. Got it.  JOANNE: So   big night tonight.  First, I'm happy to report that Linda and I scored  a ton of auction items.  - Spirit fingers. - All right.  Now that we have all this fun stuff,  let's decide what the darn theme is.  We have three top contenders  - Surfin' PTA, - Mm.  Under The Big Top,  and Garfield versus Snoopy.  I, for one, will be voting  for Linda's amazing Surfin' PTA idea.  All in favor of Surfin' PTA, raise your hands.  Well, I guess there's no reason to hold a vote  for the other two. We have a winner!  (gasps) Let's go surfin', baby!  Hold on. As future treasurer, I have to put my foot down.  We can't afford this.  Actually, that brings us  to our next vote, PTA treasurer.  Okay, let's get this over with.  We have two candidates on the ballot.  Two? I'm ""unopposed.""  All of a sudden I'm ""opposed""?  - Who's the opposer? - Linda Belcher.  - Linda? What? - Wait. What? I am?  Linda told me over breakfast the other day  that she'd like to be more involved.  That's true.  Everyone voting for Linda Belcher,  raise your hand.  She's got my vote.  Okay. Now everyone voting  for Colleen Caviello, raise your hand.  It looks like Linda Belcher is our new PTA treasurer.  You just voted like really dumb people,  and that's all I'm saying.  And you're gonna regret this for the rest of your lives.  That's all I'm saying!  Linda, you're on the board.  - You're in the big show. - Oh, my God, I'm on the board.  Thank you, Beth. Wait, don't-don't eat those.  Joanne, hey. Hi.  - Hey, there, new treasurer. - Aw.  I just wanted to say thanks for supporting me.  You're gonna be great.  Hey, are those the bottles of wine  that were donated for the auction?  You need me to help you bring those in?  Oh. No. I'm taking those home.  Those are really old.  Are those gift cards and candles for the auction, too?  Oh, yeah. They got dirt on them.  And also, that candle smells bad.  Hey, do you want a bottle of wine?  And a bad-smelling candle?  - Here you go. - Oh.  - You're on the board, now. - Oh, uh, uh, no.  - We're gonna make a great team. - Uh uh  Bye!  Oh, boy.  Mmm. What smells like rosemary mint melon?  N-Nothing. Bye! (panting)  Ah, you know, I'm so glad you were able to come by  the restaurant today to work on PTA stuff, Joanne.  Me, too. I know you've only been treasurer for one day,  but I think you might be the best treasurer  in the history of the school, maybe even the country.  Thank you, Joanne.  - Also, did you lose weight? - In a day? Maybe.  Anyway, I thought maybe you'd like to sign this contract.  Contract? Sure.  Oh, wait, I don't have a pen.  - Oh, just use your blood. - Huh?  (laughs evilly)  - Oh, your face! - (laughs)  Oh, my face!  (gasps) Bob, wake up. I need to talk to you.  (mumbling) Huh? Wha What? What's going on?  Bob, I don't feel good about Joanne  taking that donation wine.  And then giving me the wine,  which I didn't drink, by the way.  Was I not supposed to drink that?  I gotta talk to her tomorrow.  I gotta let her know how I feel.  Yeah. I-I know what you mean.  It's like this whole bird thing with Mr. Kim and  - (snoring) - Oh.  LINDA: So, Joanne,  uh, listen, the reason I wanted to talk to you is that I  Oh, before I forget, I have a little surprise for you, Linda.  It's your very own PTA pendant.  (gasps) It's gorgeous.  So shiny.  What was it that you wanted to talk to me about, Linda?  Well, I just wanted to say  I'm not so sure PTA members  should be taking donated stuff for themselves.  So, uh  Anyway muffins.  You are absolutely right.  I am so glad you understand.  It-It's just, you know,  I put a lot of time into the PTA.  I mean, it's almost a full-time job,  except that it's not, because I don't get paid.  And sometimes, I guess in a moment of weakness,  I might, you know, order a muffin  on the PTA credit card.  I guess I-I feel like I deserve it.  - (crying) - Aw.  Oh, don't cry, Joanne.  I'm sorry I said anything.  Hey, one muffin ain't nuffin'.  But it is, Linda. One muffin is suffin'.  Do you think I'm a bad person, Lin-Lin?  No. No, Jo-Jo.  Are you kidding me?  (exhales) Should we split it, or  I mean, we don't want to use this, right?  You know what? Let's put it on the PTA card.  - We earned it. - If you say so. (laughs)  By the way, here are the invoices for everything.  I need my new treasurer to approve all the purchases  and enter them into the spreadsheets.  - You think you could do that? - Yeah, sure.  I'll, uh, start spreading the sheets.  Uh, hey. I'm the guy who called  about the missing bird on the flyer.  Uh, right. Great. Is it, uh, in that box?  Yeah, well, well, hold on.  Is this a reward situation or what?  - I don't know. - Name your price.  - Gene. - $10,000.  Gene, stop. Uh, what's your price?  - $10,000? - No.  - $15,000. - Stop.  - Do I hear 20? - (sighs)  Look, I'll-I'll give you ten bucks.  And we'll throw in this formerly fun  but now super nasty pipe.  It comes with one hot dog that's already stuck inside.  Eh, all right. I'll-I'll take it.  Really? Uh, okay.  So, let's see the bird.  This isn't a parrot. This is a pigeon.  No, it's not. It's, uh, it's just scared,  - so it's acting like a pigeon. - I do that sometimes.  No. You know what, I-I'm not paying for this.  Are you accusing me of catching a pigeon  and trying to sell it for ten bucks?  - Yes. - Well, I'm leaving.  And I'm taking the bird with me. And this pipe.  That's fine.  LINDA: Huh.  These science kits cost $40 each?  Let me see how much these things cost on the website.  Science Wow Products.  Oh, Joanne's buying them retail.  That's why they're so expensive.  Why would she do that?  ""Science Wow is a division of Jo-Jo Bear Publishing.""  Wait a minute. Jo-Jo Bear  I call him Bear, and he calls me Jo-Jo.  Oh, my goodness! Joanne and her husband  own the company that makes the science kits.  (gasps) This is bad. This is Jo-Jo Beary bad.  So, this is what it looks like  when someone listens to one of Mom's ideas.  So many dad sandals.  So many milky white ankles.  There she is. The Big Little Liar herself.  Lin, are you sure you still want to do this?  I don't want to do this, Bob. I have to.  I tried calling her, but she never picked up.  Then I called the National PTA hotline,  and the only options were press one for car washes  and press two for bake sales. So now we're down to this.  The Bleach Boys, everybody.  - The Bleach Boys. - (applause)  Oh, I get it. 'Cause they're janitors.  - (laughs) - We have CDâs I can burn  from my computer at home. E-mail me.  Before we get to the auction, some thank yous.  There is one person in particular.  Ladies and gentlemen,  our new PTA treasurer, Linda Belcher.  I know her. Linda, hi!  And now on to the auction.  Actually, uh, Joanne, if I may just say a few words?  Oh. Um, okay.  I just wanted to say the reason  I got more involved with the PTA  was because I was so inspired by Joanne.  Aw. Thank you, Linda.  It's my pleasure, Jo-Jo. Fun fact, everyone  Joanne's husband calls her Jo-Jo,  and she calls him Bear.  This is a really good speech.  (laughs) That's true.  - Uh, okay. I Can I - Okay. Give it back.  - Just Release. - I got it. (grunts)  Okay. Well, let's get on with the auction, shall we?  -And they even have a company called Jo-Jo Bear. -Okay.  Spirit fingers. Spirit fingers.  And what's even more interesting  is that their company makes the very expensive science kits  that we're raising funds for tonight.  Isn't that a coincidence?  Linda, what are you doing?  Yeah, yeah. She bought all the science kits  from her own company at a crazy high price.  That's not true. And even if it was,  all the invoices were entered and approved by the treasurer,  - which is you. - Right.  Which I now see is what you wanted  because you didn't think I knew what I was doing.  And yes, for a little while,  I was entering commas instead of decimals  and lowercase Ls instead of 1's  because they look the same, but then I figured it out.  And then I got someone to check my work.  (gasps) Colleen?  Hello, Joanne.  Wait. Why is she in the shark costume?  Linda thought it would be more dramatic.  She was right.  This is ridiculous. You have nothing on me.  Oh, we have plenty on you, Joanne.  Linda called me last night.  - And you hung up on me. - I did.  But then you left that weird message,  and I called you back.  It wasn't weird. It was fine.  Well, everyone in my house listened to it,  and we all thought it was very weird.  Anyway, came over to my house  - Her slightly tacky house. - How dare you?  Oh, give me a break.  And she showed me all the spreadsheets.  I spent all night auditing  every PTA expense over the last two years,  and it looks like someone's been skimming off the top.  Okay, sure. I might take an occasional bottle of wine  or an eyebrow threading gift certificate.  I mean, not that I need it. I just wanted to try it.  But let's be honest, who's gonna plan an event like this?  You, Colleen? You, Linda?  You, Beth?  Do you have any idea  how many e-mails I send a week?  No, you don't. Because no one reads them.  No one even clicks on them!  I will not be questioned  by people eating crab cakes that I ordered  on napkins I folded.  I'm not in the PTA.  I am the PTA!  Did she say that there were crab cakes here?  All right, it's auction time!  Our first item is a basket of smelly soaps.  No takers? No one?  It's over, Joanne.  - No! No! - Give me the microphone.  - No! I can't do it! Oh! - Give it! Give it now. Give it!  - (panting) - All those in favor  of replacing Joanne as PTA president,  raise your hand.  Fine. I'll leave.  Good luck cleaning up all this sand.  Raise your hand if you're sticking around after  to clean up sand.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I'm gonna miss her.  One, two, three, four!  (vocalizing)  LOUISE: This is gonna be great.  There's nothing a free bird can't fix.  That is what the song ""Free Bird"" is about.  - Bob, what are you doing here? - Hey, Teddy.  We're bringing Mr. Kim a bird as a sorry gift.  I'm also bringing him a bird.  - What? - I want to get my discount back.  W-Well, I'm gonna give him  - my bird first. - Not if I beat you to it.  -No, no, no, no, no. No pushing, Teddy. -(grunting)  - Oh! - (bird squawks)  Is that Did he already get a new bird?  - Looks like it. - You!  - Leave the birds. Let's go. - We got you birds!  - Now you have three birds. - You're welcome.  We love your store.  -  Hoo  -  La, la, la   -  Hah  -  La, la, la   -  Hoo  -  La, la, la   - Hah  - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, whoo   -  Hoo  -  La, la, la   -  Hah  -  La, la, la   -  Hoo  -  La, la, la   - Hah  - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   Hah.   (Branca vocalizing)"
"1  GENE: So  a cruise ship is docking in town today.  Who wants to hit the pier after school  and play a little sunburn bingo?  -What's sunburn bingo? -We look at the cruise ship people  on the beach and the first one to spot all five kinds  of funny sunburns wins.  Flip-flop feet, sunscreen hand-print on your back  Left your glasses on, strap attack and upper butt.  I'm in. Tina?  Um, maybe. Hey, Jimmy Jr., do you want to go?  - Uh, that sounds kind of - Like a hot date? (chuckles)  - Get it? - Uh uh  I get it! I like funny sunburns. Count me in.  Oh, okay. Uh, yeah, then me, too. Yeah.  Huh, Jimmy Jr. and Zeke. Great.  - Come here, J-Ju! Come on. - Zeke. (laughs)  - Zeke. (shouts) Zeke! - Okay, okay.  Wait, wait, Zeke, what are you doing up there?  Wait. Oh, okay.  I'm coming at you from the top rope! Here I go!  - Wait, Zeke, don't. - Zeke, get down from that table.  - Brace yourself, J-Ju! Here I go! - Zeke, stop.  - Zeke! Ow! My penis! - (shouts)  That does it, Zeke. Detention, after school today.  - Aw, dag. - M-Mr. Frond, give me detention, too.  No. Go ask the lunch lady for some ice for your penis.  I guess we'll have to play sunburn bingo without you, Zeke.  Well, think of me while you're sunburn-shaming the tourists.  Maybe. We might. Might not, though.  - JIMMY JR.: I will! - But we won't.  Hello, Bob and Linda.  - Oh, hey. - Hey, Randy.  What can I get you, a burger?  Oh, thank you, Linda. I've already eaten,  and I'm a vegetarian. Meat is murder.  But you can get me this.  - Uh, what? - A hug?  The restaurant.  You want to buy it?  God, no. I want to rent it out  to shoot my independent short feature film here.  - Exciting. - It is!  My film is about a man looking back on his life.  It's called A Life Well Steved.  I play Steve.  - (gasps) I love it. - Hmm.  And this place is even better than my original location,  which fell through when it burned down.  Maybe because I overloaded the circuits with my lighting.  - Maybe not. - Uh, what?  -And I'll need to shoot it tomorrow. -Tomorrow?  Sorry, Randy, but tomorrow's Saturday,  and it's usually our busiest day of the week. (laughs) I  I don't think you can afford to pay us enough to close  - Oh, you can. - Mm-hmm.  H-How do you Oh, right. You're a trust fund kid.  We prefer the term ""lucky baby duckies.""  Ooh, we'll have a whole film crew in here.  The lighting guy will be over there,  and the ""cinnamon-tographer"" will be over there.  Nope. It'll just be me.  I am my own ""cinnamon-tographer.""  I'm also the writer, director, producer and star.  And makeup artist and on-set tutor.  - I'm tingling! - Uh, well  Come on, Bob. You love movies.  - This will be fun. - Yeah. Maybe it'll be fun.  I mean, probably not, but let's do it.  - Great! - All right.  I'll bring some of my gear over in a little bit.  See you guys later.  Our restaurant's gonna be famous.  Just like the restaurant in Seinfeld.  ""More soup for you.""  I still only have upper butt and strap attack.  Did these cruise people finally discover sunscreen?  This is nice, huh, Jimmy Jr.?  - You, me, the kids. - Look!  Zeke's here. Zeke!  - Damn it. - Come stand next to me.  - Tina, move over a little. - So, closer?  - No. - Like this?  No. Take, like, two steps that way.  -Oh. -Wait, why do you look so sad, Zeke?  I got problems.  My dad got mad at me about getting detention.  Well, he should be used to it by now.  No, this time it's serious.  He said if I get one more detention,  he's sending me to a special school an hour away  for kids who need guidance with disciplinary issues.  An hour away?  - Oh, no. - Sorry, Zeke.  - (groans) - That's really far.  Yeah, damn. Well, we'll just have to make the best of it,  Jimmy Jr. We'll hang out all week  and then, uh, maybe see Zeke on the weekends.  You can call them the ""Zeke-ends.""  W-We can work on your issues, Zeke.  - W-We can't let this happen! - It already happened.  - Wait, what do you mean? - When I was in detention,  Mr. Frond left me alone for a little while,  and I spelled a bad word on the ceiling  by whipping wet toilet paper up there.  He's gonna see it on Monday.  JIMMY JR.: Why, Zeke? Why would you do that?  ZEKE: I don't know! I was   I was frustrated, I guess.  Where did you get the toilet paper?  I always carry a roll for emergency pranks and poops.  - Smart. - What bad word did you spell?  Basically every bad word strung together.  -Whoa. -How did you decide which word went first?  - Sound. - This is the worst thing ever.  I can't only see you on the Zeke-ends.  That's not enough Zeke for me.  - Wh-Who will I eat lunch with? - Me.  - Who will I wrestle with? - Me.  Who's gonna explain cootie catchers to me?  Me. I mean, I kind of get them.  What are we gonna do?!  Well, I mean, if I was in this situation,  I'd just sneak into the school tomorrow  and take the toilet paper bad word off the ceiling  before anyone sees it. But that's me.  Maybe you guys don't want to walk on the wild side.  - No, no, we do want to. - Yeah, I'll do anything.  But how would we get in?  - Tomorrow's Saturday. - Yeah.  Well, I've been working on a prank for when I graduate.  It involves a lot of crickets, but that's a whole other story.  -Tell me at bedtime. -I haven't worked the prank out entirely,  but I have figured out how to get in the school.  The gym has a window about eight feet high  that's always cracked a little.  We could push a dumpster over by the window,  climb up and pull it open.  It only opens wide enough  to slip a very small person inside.  Or a million crickets.  ZEKE: What about you?  Flattered, but no. Smaller than me.  I was thinking Pocket Sized Rudy.  He goes through the window, opens the door for us,  bing, bang, boom.  Ooh, Pocket Sized Rudy is in Colonial Williamsburg.  Again? God, that family loves candle making.  Well, there's got to be other small kids at our school.  There is this kid in my class, Arnold Evans.  He's a really smart eight-year-old  who skipped a grade.  That kid who wears a karate outfit to school sometimes?  Or what I think is a karate outfit?  - I don't really get fashion. - Yeah, that's him.  I bet he could fit through that window. What do you think?  -Let's do it. -Hell yeah! -I'm in.  But maybe not, because breaking into the school is wrong.  Let's think about that for a second.  Thought about it. We're doing it.  Look at y'all, helping old Zeke out.  Sense of community and whatnot.  Yeah, you're not going anywhere.  - (crying): I hope not. - Room for one more?  (Tina groans)  Great. Okay, Belcher kid meeting.  Arnold said he's in as long as we call him ""sensei.""  I said no. He said he's still wearing his karate outfit.  - I said fine. - Great.  But now we got to figure out  what we're gonna tell Mom and Dad  about why we can't work tomorrow. Ugh.  Easy. We tell them we're doing something stupid and helpful,  like cleaning up the beach.  Oh, perfect. Follow my lead.  Hey, kids.  Mom, Dad, we've got some big news  that we think you're gonna be excited about.  Wait, what's all this?  Oh, Randy's shooting a movie here tomorrow.  So we're closing. You guys have the day off.  - Oh, cool. - Wh-What's the big news, Louise?  Um, that we love you guys.  - In spite of everything. - Aw.  Belcher kid meeting. Okay, that first Belcher kid meeting  was unnecessary. We're good.  -Operation help Zeke is a go. -Yay! -Yay.  Okay, Arnold should be here any minute.  In the meantime, Zeke,  go ahead and wrestle that window open.  (grunting) Get open. Come on.  - Loosen up. You son of a - Hi, guys. -Hi.  - Arnold. - Hi, buddy. - Sup?  Ready to slide through this window, Arnold?  Look, I know I'm here because I'm height-impaired  and, uh, size-challenged and, uh  - Small? - Eh, uh (chuckles)  Really don't like that word too much. Uh  You should know that I have many talents,  uh, that can be of service.  For instance, my skills.  (grunts) How about that?  It looks very much like you're about to do the robot.  That'll, uh, come in handy, for sure.  But first, how about you slip in the window  and open the door for us?  Guys, I think we're pressuring Arnold too much.  He doesn't have to do this if he doesn't want to.  No, I want to. The karate code says  - you must help people in need. - Damn.  Preesh. Now get up here. Come on.  I mean, it doesn't say that verbatim,  but, uh, it's implied.  - Great. - (grunts) Wha  Oh, God. It's a long drop.  (screams)  LOUISE: Arnold? Buddy? You okay?  - Does this look okay? - Let's do this!  Oops. I forgot to prop the door open.  One more time?  Okay, lets get shooting.  So, you do the whole thing into the camera?  Like you're, like you're talking to it  - like it's a person? - That's right, Linda.  Steve delivers his monologue to the camera,  reflecting on flashback scenes that I already shot.  Now shush, Bob. We're about to roll.  I-I didn't say any  - Bob, shush. - Okay. All right.  And action.  Looking back on my life, it's funny.  The things I did that made people happy.  The things I did that made people sad.  The whole time, I had no idea what an impact I had.  Whether it was reading to Grandpa  when he was in the home  or seeing a stranger on a windy day  and offering them my comb.  -(whispers): Wait, does this all rhyme? -Shh!  And cut. Did you say something, Bob?  No. Actually, Linda was saying something  about how everything rhymed  - and if that was weird. - Nuh-uh.  We're in. Hard part's over.  Should be smooth sailing now.  - (all scream) - JIMMY JR.: My penis!  What the hell? Why are the hallways all slippy-slidey?  -(Branca vocalizing) -Shh! Look, Mr. Branca's waxing the floors.  Oh, no, we're busted.  Oh, good, he's waxing away from us.  Everyone take off your shoes.  If we don't scuff his floors, he won't know we're here.  Summer breeze   Makes me feel fine   Blowing through the jasmine   Detention room's this way, J-Ju.  I know, I'm just grabbing this to knock the bad word  off the ceiling in the suspension room.  My main man's bright.  I mean, not book smart, but broom smart.  RANDY: And you know what  was the big game changer?  When I decided to never again use the word ""stranger.""  - (whispers): He's still rhyming. - And cut.  Bob, why don't you stand in the kitchen  so I won't pick you up on the audio.  - Fine. - I'm so sorry, Randy.  -I can still hear you breathing, Bob! -Oh, uh,  go in the employee bathroom, Bob.  - Perfect. - BOB: No.  I'm not standing in the bathroom  - while you shoot the movie. - Come on, Bob.  BOB: I thought this might be fun,  but I'm annoyed that I have to stand in here  - while you're shooting. - You're annoyed?  - You're annoying. - BOB: You are!  - You are! - BOB: You are!  Ooh, behind-the-scenes movie drama.  I bet this was what it was like on the set of E.T.  Spielberg and E.T. just going at it.  - There it is. - ALL: Whoa.  That really is every swear word put together.  I'm impressed, Zeke.  Guys, I'm not sure how we're gonna get that down.  I had my great broom idea, but I don't  I don't think it's long enough to reach.  Let me see. (grunts)  Poop. I guess this is a real mission impossible, right? Poop!  Wait, what if I get on that desk and J-Ju gets on my shoulders?  - I bet it would reach. - That's so smart, Zeke.  Let's do it. Come on. Come on, get up here.  - Okay, uh - Come on. Ooh, wow.  - You losing weight, J-Ju? - (chuckles) A-a little.  - (sighs) - ZEKE: Come on! (grunting)  - Ow. Still not close enough. - Come on!  - Push! - (grunts)  - Aah! - Well, it's a start.  Yeah, but at this rate, we'll be here all day.  As long as we're done by 4:00.  There's a Facts of Life marathon,  and, honey, I've been training for it.  And I thought to myself, ""I can't take another hurdle.  I think I am that baby turtle.""  And cut.  Oh, Randy, that was beautiful.  - Oh, you think so? - Oh, yeah, it was perfect.  - It wasn't too on the nose? - No.  Thanks. That means a lot.  How long have you been finished?  Were you ever gonna tell me when to leave the bathroom?  Oh, relax, Bob. We just cut.  You're free to stay out here  while I rehearse the turn in my monologue.  Wow, thank you.  (clears throat) You think I wanted to end up here?  In a depressing place like this?  - Day after day? - BOB: What? Wait.  I thought this was about a guy  happily looking back on his life.  And by the way, Randy, what happened to the rhyming?  First of all, I don't know what you're talking about  with the rhyming. Second, I did some  last-minute rewrites this morning.  The whole thing was just too neat.  It needed a dark turn.  Is it still called A Life Well Steved?  It is, but I added some commas.  So now it's A Life, Well, Steved.  Like he had good intentions, then he ""Steved"" it up.  - Oh, I get it. - (Bob sighs)  You didn't say you were gonna make the restaurant sound  - like a depressing - Stink hole?  - No. I didn't say that. - Well, I'm gonna use it.  Y-You can't call my restaurant a stink hole.  - Did you cash the check? - (sighs) Yes.  - I'm saying stink hole. - Damn it!  (humming)  - (Gene grunts) - Ugh. It looks like we only got  about a quarter of it down.  I-I can still make out a few swear words.  Yeah. And they're the worst ones.  - Even I'm offended by that one. - H'yah!  Well, gang call the people who clean up stadiums,  because we left it all on the field.  - We tried our best. Darn. - Wait, wait.  I saw a ladder in the closet that I took the broom from.  So you saw a ladder but you grabbed a broom.  - You're lucky you're cute. - H'yah!  Let's go grab that ladder.  But Mr. Branca's still out there.  Yeah. He already waxed off.  - We don't want him to wax on. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.  -It's okay for me to make that joke. -H'yah!  - (clattering) - Hello? What was that noise?  - (whispers): Who is that? - FROND: Hello?  It's Mr. Frond.  - Oh, no. - We're screwed.  - Dang. - Finally. I mean, fudge.  - What should we do? - Don't make a sound.  I can go out there and put a wrist lock on him.  Take him down. Is that cool?  No Maybe. No.  Is someone here? I heard a noise.  Maybe it came from over here. (screams)  What are you doing walking all over my clean floors?!  I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Branca. I forgot today was floor waxing.  I came in to try on some shirts I bought online.  The mirrors in the second floor bathrooms are flattering  I-I mean, honest.  Tell me about it. (laughs)  Anyway, I-I-I thought I heard something,  but I guess it was you.  Yes. Now please, take off your shoes.  Okay, but I have to take my pants off to get my shoes off.  - Don't ask questions. - Oh, thank God. - (all sigh)  Great. Now we have to sneak around Mr. Branca and Mr. Frond.  The odds are stacked against us.  Two powerhouses out there.  Okay, I think Mr. Frond should be doing whatever weird thing  he said he was doing in the bathroom by now.  Let's slide over to the closet and get that ladder.  GENE: Is it a corporate ladder?  'Cause I'm gonna climb that son of a bitch.  RANDY: Be honest.  Is this terrible, terrible place purgatory?  It's worse? Oh, dear God.  - And cut. - This is so  Who-who is your character even talking to?  - Is it your evil twin? - Good guess, Linda, but no.  It's something no other film  - has ever done before. - I give up.  Death. I've been talking to Death.  Oh, like that Ingmar Bergman movie  where the guy's playing chess with Death?  Or that movie where Brad Pitt plays Death?  What's it called? Meet Jack Black?  Nope. Totally different. Not like those at all.  I'm going to put this on and shoot the big reveal  of Death sitting across from me.  If I gave you your money back, Randy,  would you just leave right now?  - No. - (sighs)  (Branca vocalizing)  (continues vocalizing)  - (door closing) - Hmm?  Mm.  Ladders are great; they're like skinny stairs.  We're gonna be outta here in no time.  Yeah, and then you won't have to go  to that special impulse control school,  and we can keep hanging out all day every day, Zeke.  Yeah. In between classes and everything.  - Quick hug. - Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  (Tina sighs)  So now you're just gonna shoot the other way,  - with Death reacting to Steve? - Yes.  So the big reveal of Death is just you  cutting back and forth between Steve and Death?  - Yep. - Isn't that gonna look  - kind of stupid? - Groundbreaking?  You need someone else to play Death, Randy,  so you can get a shot with both of you in it, you idiot.  Oh, I'll do it.  Ah, nah, Death is probably a white man.  - Bob, you do it. - Yeah, Bob, you do it.  Fine, Randy, I will do it!  Great, you'll need this!  This is actually kind of cool!  I know! You're welcome!  I'm so glad y'all helped me dodge this bullet.  The other school's motto is: ""We never give up on you.""  That's too much pressure.  Yeah, what's their problem?  I mean, it sounds like a pretty good school,  but I guess you won't get the help you need. That's all.  It's like it's snowing.  I'm gonna make a toilet paper angel. Ah.  -I wish I could be that carefree. -(grunting)  But a lot of people depend on me.  Okay, last row. Zeke, make it count.  Okay, tee-pee, you don't have to get flushed,  (grunting): but you can't stay here.  Okay, this is clearly a women's camouflage tank.  But I'm not not pulling it off.  I'll take a lap in it and see how it feels.  That's the last of it. Like it never happened.  -(cheering) -Okay, who's in there? I heard that.  - Someone's in there. - Uh-oh.  I can wait here all day.  If you think I have somewhere better to be  on a Saturday, think again.  - What do we do? - I don't know,  but at least he can't get in here.  Oh, there's a key to this room  in Ms. Schnur's office. (laughs)  - Crap. - (Frond screaming)  Whoa! Oh. Oh, great.  I think that's a stain. I guess I have to keep it now.  - What do we do now? - Mr. Frond is coming back  - any second with that key. - We should go out the window.  I mean, we'd fall to our deaths because we're on  the second floor, but maybe.  Well, I guess this is it.  I can't stand it, Zeke.  Thanks for trying, everyone.  I'm gonna take this stapler  to remember this place by.  Every time I look at this stapler,  I'll think of you, Jimmy Jr.  I don't know why you picked a stapler, but okay.  Zeke has a stapler and you have me, Jimmy Jr.  Everything worked out the way it was supposed to.  I thought we could fix this, Zeke.  I thought I could keep us together.  (sobbing): We did everything we could.  (sobbing): I'll never be happy again, Zeke.  It's so cute how they're both ugly criers.  (sighs) I have an idea.  We all transfer to the special school?  - We go up. - Do what?  We go up into the ceiling,  then we pull the ladder up, replace the tile,  and crawl to another spot in the school where we can climb down.  The ceiling can't hold us, Tina, it's just those dumb tiles.  The tiles can't hold us but the cable trays can.  They're bolted into the ceiling.  Cable trays? What language are you speaking, girl?  All the computer cables and stuff  are on these metal tracks up there.  - They can hold our weight. - How do you know that?  I, um, heard that a friend of mine, a cool friend,  might've used to go up there and try to catch a glimpse  of anything in the boys' locker room.  Y-You don't know her.  She's great and she's gorgeous. O-Okay.  Everyone, put on your shoes and let's go.  But is it safe-ish?  Just stay on the tray, and don't wobble.  And spread out. And may God have mercy on our souls.  Okay, let's pull the ladder up.  (metal clanking)  What on Earth is that sound?  Gotcha! What the ?  So there's the story of my life. At least, my side of it.  Please, let me go back.  I don't want to be stuck in this stink hole.  - Nice. - How could anyone spend eternity  in a place like this? (spits)  I want to turn my life around.  Can you wait to take me? Just a few more years?  Can you spare me for just a few more years?  Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you.  And cut.  - Oh, that was great. - Really?  Yeah. That was, uh, that was something, Randy.  Ah! And so moving.  (sighs) Okay, well, then I guess that's a wrap.  Thank you, Bob. I think we made  something really special here today.  Uh, I'm happy for you, Randy,  and I'm also happy that it's over.  And I'm keeping this robe; I've never had a robe.  This was a great idea, T-Bird.  LOUISE: Do you know where we are, Tina?  I think we're over the hallway.  We'll have to find the lockers and jump down on those.  You lost me at ""jump down.""  - I just don't under What? - (rattling overhead)  Is somebody up there? (grunts)  - (Frond grunting) - Go, go, go. Go.  (Zeke grunting)  Zeke, throw that stapler that way.  Maybe Mr. Frond will go down the wrong hallway.  - Okay. - W-W-Wait. Wait. Wait, Zeke.  Let me do it. I can fling it like a throwing star.  But Zeke's a little stronger.  - I need this. - Oh, gosh.  Okay. Let it fly, little guy.  I believe in you,  - but also, don't mess up. - H'yah!  - Whoa. - Wow, you got that far.  - Damn. - Now you know.  Okay, gotcha!  (grunting)  - (groans) - What the hell are you doing?  You're getting ceiling dirt all over my floors!  - There's somebody up there. - LOUISE: Move it.  BRANCA: You are cleaning this up.  -I heard people in that room, and -Oh, really?  -And then in the ceiling. -Well, how did they get in the ceiling?  Did they fly?  - (overlapping arguing) - Here.  BRANCA: You are ca-ca cuckoo. You know that, Mr. Frond?  FROND: I am not ca-ca cuckoo.  - BRANCA: But I like that shirt. - FROND: Thank you.  It's a men's tank.  Bye. No one's gonna see that movie, right?  Eh, maybe those tomato people will?  See how many tomatoes they'll give it?  This place isn't like death, is it?  What? Course not.  I mean, we're probably gonna die here, but you know  - Uh, not helping. - But not for a long, long time.  And I wouldn't trade that for anything.  - Mwah! - (chucking)  You want to die in our restaurant?  Yeah. In 60 years. Both of us, same time.  We'll cross our eyes, stick out our tongues and fall over.  I-I think I'm gonna smile a little,  so I don't freak out the kids when they find us.  They said we'd never be able to pull it off,  just like the Band-Aid on my testicles.  Uh, Tina,  you really made me the happiest boy today.  - I did? - Yeah, you really came through  - with that ceiling thing. - Well, you know, it was nothing.  But you can keep telling me how happy I make you.  What are you guys talking about?  Just that it's all thanks to Tina  that you won't be sent away to that stupid school.  -That's right. You saved me, Tina. -(groans)  I just have to never get in trouble again.  I can do that.  - Come here, you, come on. - Ow.  - Get over here. - Zeke! Zeke! No.  - Don't give me a wedgie. - (Zeke grunting)  I know it's hard to give up having Jimmy Jr.'s butt  all to yourself, but you did the right thing, T,  helping out those two idiots.  I know. Stop reminding me.  I hope Mr. Branca finds the note we left.  ""We found your ladder in the trash  ""and put it back in the ceiling for you.  ""You're welcome! X-O-X-O,  Your Secret Admirer.""  Oh  Wet toilet paper   Ooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh   Climbing through the window   J-Ju's got the broomstick   Climb into the ceiling   Ooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh   Look out!   Waxing all the hallways   Stapler   Fling it like a throwing star   Ooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh   Sliding on the clean floors   Toilet paper angel   Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah."
"1  LINDA: Okay, Gayle, stop screaming.  I promised the kids I'd take them to the water park today,  but I'll come over tonight. All right?  - Bye. - What's wrong with Gayle now?  Other than everything?  Oh, she got pink eye  from letting her cat sleep on her face  and she can't do her eye drops herself.  - So I have to go do 'em for her later. - Sure.  Poor Gayle. She's just so  - (groans) - She really is.  I got pink eye on my foot once.  - Hmm. - What's taking the kids so long?  I want to get a prime spot in the adults-only tanning area.  Got to get my rich, deep-developed summer tan  - in just one day. - Do you mean  you're just gonna get really burned?  Aw. Yeah.  The burn is just the sun's way of saying, ""Hey, beautiful.""  Well, the goggles aren't in the dresser.  We have to find them. If my gorgeous eyes get red,  they'll cancel my modeling contract.  LOUISE: You know, while I'm under here,  maybe I should just check in the super secret hiding place.  I mean, it's not even close to my birthday,  but you never kno Oh, my gosh.  - What have we here? - Probably something secret  and we should put it back and forget we ever saw it?  Or we could go the other way with it.  GENE: Who could it be for?  Well, it was in the super secret hiding place,  so it's clearly for one of us.  I bet it's a small energy-efficient car for moi.  Maybe it's one really delicious grape?  Well, whatever it is, we're about to find out.  Slowly, slowly.  - A ring? - (gasps) Gasp.  Dad's gonna propose. Mom's gonna be so surprised.  Hold on. Aren't they already married?  I think so. Wait, no. They're brother and sister?  Huh. I wonder what this is for.  Well, I got to go round up my little sea creatures.  My little piranhas in pajamas.  - (door opens, bell jingles) - (whispering): Bob.  Bob. Bob.  Wh-What, Teddy?  Isn't tomorrow your anniversary?  Yes, but why are you whispering?  - There's no one else in here. - (normal voice): Oh, right.  Well, I got a notification on my phone this morning  that tomorrow was the big day.  9/3. So I figured I'd remind you  - so that you'd - Oh, wait, wait, wait.  You have my anniversary on your phone?  Of course I do. Got your size, food allergies,  - birthstone. - Uh, that's f-fine, I guess.  So, do you need some help throwing something together,  - last-minute? - No. Actually, I  I-I started working on a song for you.  - To sing.  Linda  - Teddy.  You're so pretty   -  It's a sin-da  - Teddy, Teddy.  - Teddy. I remembered. - What?  Okay? I I-I remembered our anniversary.  - You did? - Yes, and this year,  not only did I remember, I actually got her  a gift she's really gonna love.  I'm finally gonna give her an engagement ring.  Wow. Wait, why?  Are you doing, like, a Benjamin Button marriage?  Where you get engaged at the end?  No, no. When I proposed, I didn't have a ring.  I just gave her a-a high five.  Uh, you know. A romantic one.  But now I finally got her something she can actually wear.  It even has a diamond on it.  - (whistles) - Yeah. Cost me $329.  - Which Yeah. Which, um - Wow. (groans)  which I'm gonna pay off in $15 increments  - over 24 months with interest. - So where is it?  Where is it? I-I want to see it.  - I want to see it. - Teddy, Teddy. Calm down.  Sorry, sorry.  I-I've got it all wrapped up and hidden away  - in the super secret hi - In the super secret hiding spot?  You also probably shouldn't know about that.  But, yes. I-It's gonna be perfect.  I actually feel really good about myself for once.  So, should I not tell you you've got a weird booger in your nose?  It's been wiggling around a lot while you talk.  - Oh. No, no, no, no. - Want me to just get it?  -Just, uh, just a little. Let me get it. -No, I'll get it.  Let me get it. Let me get it. Let me get it.  - Let me get it. Ow! - I got it. Get Oh! Get away!  Ow, ow, why?  - Ring-a-ding-damn. - My turn.  - What are you kids doing in here? - Oh.  Just talking about how great you are.  Aw, well, come on. We got to go.  It's called Wetty, Set, Go, not Wetty, Set, Wait Around. (laughs)  - Take the ring off. - I can't get it  - off my finger. - LINDA: Come on.  Come on, come on, come on. Out, out, out, out, out.  Let's go, let's get wet.  (Gene grunting)  - This mama jama is stuck. - Wow, it's really on there.  I know. I think it may have grafted to my skin.  We're just gonna have to cut the finger off.  No. What about when I want to waggle my fingers  - and say ""toodle-oo""? - LINDA: What are you kids  whispering about back there?  - Oh, uh -Secrets. - Boys we like.  Oh, fun.  We'll get it off when we get there.  Until then, everyone just act cool.  You got it. (whistles, grunts)  I'm okay.    Okay, guys. Mommy's got to go get bronzed.  Meet me back here at closing time.  Wait, Mom, can we have the sunblock?  Nerd alert.  I mean, so responsible.  - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! - (grunts)  It's like someone put a tiny belt on a sausage.  - I love my finger curves. - Let me try.  (grunting)  - (grunting) - (agonized yelling)  Harder! Pull harder.  (Tina and Gene yelling)  Pull!  - (yells) - (feeble grunt)  Guys, I hate to say it, but we might have to ask  - a grown-up for help. - You shut your mouth.  Listen, we're already here and it's already stuck,  and it's not like it's Christmas tomorrow,  so let's just try to relax and enjoy ourselves  and we'll get the ring off tonight.  And if not (blows raspberry) Gene's married to Dad.  - The end. - Okay, well, what do we want  to do first slides or tubes?  TINA: Do we go crazy then lazy, or lazy then crazy?  LOUISE: That's the age-old question.  I'm going lazy river. There's nothing better  than drifting along in a tube and peeing into a river.  It's the closest a man can get to being back in the womb.  A float could float my boat.  Sure. But I want to be upstream from Gene's pee.  You can't escape it The lazy river is a flat circle.  Is it just me, or am I getting hit on  a lot because people think I'm taken?  Hey, Tina, Louise. Boy Louise.  - What's shaking? - Nat the limo driver?  As I live and breathe.  Oh, hi. Cool swim shoes.  Oh, no, these are regular shoes. They're just wet.  How have you been, Nat?  Drive anyone interesting lately?  You know a guy by the name Tom Cruise?  - Yeah. - Well, I drove a guy  who had never heard of him to the airport this morning.  - Nice. - Yeah, then I decided  to head on over here for my daily lazy.  You come here every day?  I know one of the ticket sellers.  We were next to each other in a human chain  that saved a Chihuahua that had fallen  into the half-pipe at a skate park.  So I come here on hot days during my lunch break  And sometimes that break lasts  Well, one time I fell asleep and woke up in the ocean.  Explain that.  - Your life is perfect. - It is.  - It really is. - All right, well,  we're gonna go get some slide on our hides.  I'm gonna do a quick loop and check for Speedos,  - then I'll meet you guys there. - Actually, I think  I'm gonna stay in the lazy river until my bones dissolve.  But come find me if you get ice cream or hot dogs.  The hot dogs are good here.  They put 'em right in the middle of the bun.  Ooh, ooh, ooh   I'm gettin' tan right now   I'm gonna burn real bad   And then it's gonna get real brown, yeah.   SINGERS:  Water park, water park, water park   Ooh, water park   Soakin' up the sun till I'm a leather couch mom   Soakin' in the water till my bones dissolve   Ooh   Ooh, wet butts   Ooh   Water park, water park, water park   Ooh, water park.   Oh, my God. The ring. It's gone.  LOUISE: Oh, no! It must have fallen off your finger in the water.  I knew swimming made my wiener get weird and small,  but my fingers?  I guess fingers are the wieners of the hand.  Well, your tiny wiener finger just got us in big trouble.  That burn looks pretty painful, Lin.  Oh, it is. It's awful.  But once this settles into a tan, I'm gonna look  like a leather couch. But a young one.  A hot, young, leather couch.  W-Well, I hope your burn is better by tomorrow  because (giggles)  it's our anniversary, 9/3.  - (all gasp) - Oh, my God. You're right.  - I forgot. - But-but I remembered.  And I, uh (giggles)  I I have something special for you.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Is it tandem skydiving?  Is it Cheese of the Month? No, no, wait, wait, wait.  Don't tell me.

Don't tell me.  (groaning continues)  - What's wrong, Tina? - Oh, nothing.  - She's fine, she's fine. - Oh, she s-sounds fine.  Tina, do you have diarrhea?  Do you need me and Gene to come help you  with it in the bathroom?  - Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm.  Go help Tina with the diarrhea. I'll get dessert.  Oh, God, the ring was supposed to be an anniversary present.  (groaning)  BOB: Tina, you okay?  LOUISE: She's fine.  GENE: Push. Push.  And breathe. And breathe.  - What are we gonna do? - Um, okay.  What can we do? We, uh,  we put a different ring in the box and voilÃ .  We don't have another ring, Gene.  Okay, so, we, uh, we, we stage a burglary  and in the struggle we stab Dad.  But just a little, and Mom is so glad he's alive  that she forgets all about the anniversary.  I mean, I love that, but maybe for some other time.  Christmas.  Are the kids still helping Tina with her diarrhea?  Yeah, it's kind of gross but sweet?  Kids, I got to go do Aunt Gayle's eye drops for her  - 'cause she's Aunt Gayle. - LOUISE: Okay, bye, Mom.  Tina, good luck with your diarrhea, honey.  - Lots of rice. - TINA: Thank you.  Bye, bye, bye. Stay out of my room.  Should we go ask if they found the ring at the water park?  They're closed, Tina. There's no one there to ask.  Oh, what about that pink adult lady we were hanging out with?  The one from the lazy river?  - Nat. - Yeah, she said her friend works there.  Maybe they can let us in to look for the ring.  We have to save Mom and Dad's marriage,  so Dad won't end up as a single skank.  Nat, it's Louise.  - Bunny ears. How's it blowing? - Not good, Nat.  - Not good. - Uh-oh. Lay it on me.  Today at the water park, Gene had a ring  stuck on his finger that we didn't know  was our dad's anniversary gift to our mom.  Oh, boy. So you guys were poking around  for presents in your parents' room, huh?  Found a ring, put it on, got it stuck,  - then lost it in the water? - Yep.  So you need to get in there tonight for search and rescue.  - Am I reading you right? - Loud and clear, Nat.  Okay, I'll call my water park buddy to come open 'er up,  and I've got a bunch of snorkel masks and underwater flashlights  from when I lived in a lake for a while.  - I'll be out front in 15. - Thanks, Nat.  Wait, better make it an hour. We got to pretend to go to bed.  Copy that. I'll pretend to go to bed, too.  LINDA: Okay, okay.  So just lean your head back and I'll kind of stand up here.  And you just keep your eyes open, okay?  - Okay. - Here we go.  - (screams) - Oh!

I'll kill you! - (yells) Get off of me!  - Ow, you're hurting me. - Let's see how you like it.  Get off me, you're wasting the drops.  (sputters) Oh, it's in my mouth.  Oh, God, it tastes like spoons.  Where's the ring?  (laughs nervously)  I believe it's, ""You rang?""  Do you guys want to explain this?  - Not really. - No.  Dad, I know it looks bad,  but the good news is we know where we lost it  and we're going to find it there now.  Okay, where is it?  Wait, why are you guys in swimsu  Oh, my God, is it at the water park?  - I mean, in a way. - (car horn honking)  Oh, good, our ride is here. So, Dad, we'll see you later,  and we'll have that ring for sure.  Oh, okay, you guys just go out into the night  with a total stranger and I'll stay here.  - Great. - I'm joking.  I'm coming with you.  And I-I've never been this angry.  You're all grounded for the rest of your lives.  Oh, what a fun family outing.  And none of you are allowed to talk to me,  tonight or maybe ever again, and you're not my children anymore,  and you're not allowed to come to my funeral.  Hey, Dad, I just want  No. No, no. No, no. I'm still mad.  We can't talk to you yet?  - No. - I'm sorry, Dad.  - Not now, Gene. - How about now?  - Nope. - You know, Mr. B,  I have good luck finding things.  I lost a candy bar at Lollapalooza  and found it three days later, and there was even some left.  (sighs) So what's the plan again?  We-we sneak into the water park  Not sneak My friend is letting us in.  Should we maybe wait until it's light out?  Robert, the second there's daylight,  someone is gonna find that ring,  and they're not gonna turn it in.  They're gonna put it in their dirty little pocket.  It's not an honesty park, it's a water park.  (sighs) This is a disaster.  You know what might lighten the mood in here, Mr. B?  - Do you like classical music? - Yes.  (a cappella):  Duh-dah, dah-dah, dadadadada   Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah-dah   - BOB: Okay, great.

Dead. Dead with pink eyes.  BOB: No, uh, Lin,  Uh, uh, y Look, you can't give up now.  - I can't? - No. Gayle needs you.  And I know that you can do this because you can do anything.  I can't French braid or whistle.  Well, no one can do those things.  Look, if you give up now,  you'll-you'll hate yourself forever.  Eh, I don't know if I will, act  You will!

Where's your wine, hon?  - I don't have any. - What? Beer?  - No. - How do you relax?  - I don't. - Right, right, of course not.  Well, how about this?  Why don't we just go to the grocery store  and we can get some wine to calm you down.  Then, when we get back, maybe you'll let me do it.  Okay, but I'm keeping the shower curtain on.  - Okay, fine, but I think you should put pants on. - No.  You're not wearing any underwear.  So what?  I got nothing, and I'm cold.  Same here.  I feel kind of warm.  - Oh, no, Gene? - Yup.  Enjoy it, sister.  Get back under the water, sea otters.  Come on, come on, be there.  (grunts) My-my arm is stuck! Oh, my God.  NAT: Hang on, Mr. B.  Here we go. Pull!  - Aah! - Pull!  - Whoo! There you go, big guy. - Thank you.  Okay, back at it. I'm thinking I'll start searching every bush,  grate, nook, and cranny in case Gene lost it  on his way to the car or something.  Come on, ol' girl. Hyah!  No, wait, Nat, you-you and your friends  have worked so hard to help me, and I really appreciate it, but  this park is so big and the ring is so small,  and, and I just got my arm stuck in a drain,  and I-I think this is over. I-I'm calling it.  I'll just underwhelm Linda this year like I do every year.  All right, buddy. I'll go let the gals know.  Dad, no. We can still find it.  No, Louise, I'm just gonna go underwater now,  like people do in the movies when they're sad.  No, Dad, don't go underwater. You live on land.  - You're a land dad. - I just wanted to feel beautiful.  I never should have put it on. I'm sorry, Dad.  Do you want us to go live somewhere else?  We could go to an orphanage for a while.  NAT: Hey, guys!  We got something in a drain over here. I think we got it!  LINDA: Okay, let's see, what do we want?  Red or white? Ooh, or pink to match your eye. Little rosÃ©?  Ah, I don't know. I can't really see through this thing.  Gayle, I didn't bring the eye drops into the store,  so you can take the shower curtain off.  But I don't have any makeup on. What if there are hot guys here?  Good point,  but what if they're the kind of hot guys  who are afraid of shower curtains?  Okay, I'll take it off.  Oh, and take off your glasses, too.  Let 'em really see you, that beautiful face.  - Okay. - Oh, weird, look at that.  Someone must've let go of a balloon  - and it floated to the ceiling. - Huh?  (screaming) Help! Murder!  Murder!  LINDA (whispering): Bob.  Bob, wake up. I need you to hold Gayle's arms down  so I can get this over with, or else I'm gonna kill her.  Bob?  Wha?  Huh.  Hello?  Well, where the hell are they?  Linda, have you been lying to me  about being married and having kids?  I know I've said this the last 14 times, but I think  we're gonna get it on this try.  KIDS: Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please,  oh, please, oh, please, oh, please  I got it! Oh, no.  - TINA: It's a key chain. - GENE: That says ""Ooh La La""  and that I want.  Sorry, Robert.  What the hell is going on here?  - Who's that? - Hey boss.  I'm Eddie Wetty, young man, owner of Wetty, Set, Go.  Uh, oh, uh,  - i-it's-it's an honor, your-your h-highness. - Eddie.  - Eddie. - I wasn't Wetty for this!  Josie, you want to explain why there are a bunch of kids  and a marijuana bus and a man in his underwear  here in the middle of the night?  Well, uh, you see, uh, Eddie,  uh, Mr. Wetty, I, uh  No, Josie,  i-it's my fault, sir.  I-I bought my wife an engagement ring for our anniversary  What? That makes no sense.  I know. I-It's a it's a long story.  My kids unwrapped the gift box it was in  and put it on for some reason  and then they lost it, here, today.  But my wife, she deserves something nice, for once.  I was never able to buy her a real engagement ring.  I meant to, but we run a small restaurant,  and-and we're poor and gross.  I mean, she's great.  - I-I'm gross. - I'm the fun one.  Gene. (sighs) So all these nice people came out here  to help me to look for the ring. I just  I hope you won't get Josie in trouble.  She was just trying to help.  - Well - Hold on, Mr. Wetness.  - Mom? - Linda?  - And me. - And Gayle.  - Linda! - Nat, hi!  Wh-What are you doing here?  Well, I went home  so I could have you help me hold Gayle down,  and no one was there, so I read Tina's diary and here I am.  So you just heard all that, about-about the ring?  Yes. I also read about it in the diary.  It was so detailed and up to date.  - Thank you. - (sighs) Lin, I'm sorry.  Another anniversary got messed up,  and you deserve to have a good one, one time in your life.  You don't need to give me a big old ring to prove you love me.  - Well, it wasn't big. - Well, I don't need it.  I didn't need one then, and I don't need one now.  Our love isn't in a big giant ring, you dummy.  It was very small.  Our love is in everything we've built together,  after you begged me to settle for you.  Mwah!  Another marriage saved by ol' Nat King Cole.  W-Wait, your name is Nat King Cole?  Yeah, Nat Kinkle. K-I-N-K-L-E. How are you hearing it?  Oh, never mind. Just-just-just like that.  Now, come on, let's all go home and hold Gayle down  so she can stop having poop eyes.  Never!  Aw, what the heck?  Come on, everyone. Josie, fire up the slides!  We're celebrating this fine couple's anniversary.  You got it, boss.  Aren't we all gonna get pink eye? Never mind.  - I love you, Bob. - I love you, too, Lin.  Hey! We're in a ring right now! Ha!      NAT:  Mona Linda   Mona Linda, that's your name-o   Like the lady in the art museum in France   - All right! -  You make burgers   And you love porcelain babies   And you would surely catch Tom Selleck's glance   Maybe someday.  Do you smile 'cause you've got secrets, Mona Linda?   And is your secret that you did a fart?   - Maybe. -  You love showers   You love mornings and bologna   And to Bob you'll always be a work of art.   Aw, my Bobby baby.  LOUISE: Mom, can we have the sunblock?  LINDA: Nerd alert."
"1  And with this sample, I will have reassembled  a whole tangerine in my belly. Mm, mm  Okay, Gene, maybe that's enough samples for now.  Ooh, jerky. Good shelf life.  Should we get some? Stock up for the apocalypse?  - Mm, maybe no apocalypse jerky. - Jerky jerk.  You know, I think I'd do really well in the apocalypse.  Don't you think? Aw, who am I kidding?  I'd probably get eaten immediately,  and not just because my thighs are perfect.  No, you'd be okay.  Though I am picturing you with an apple  - in your mouth right now. - Father!  Sorry. I'm sure you'd be a very capable boy.  Together we'd survive at least a day. Maybe two.  Whoa. Those are never here.  Could it really be possible?  That there's mushrooms at a farmer's market?  I'd say very possible.  Not just any mushroom, Gene.  The Woolly Neptune.  I-I had one once, years ago. It's perfect.  I've always wanted to make a burger of the day out of it.  Whoa.  That can't be right. Uh, excuse me?  The Woolly Neptune isn't really $30 an ounce, is it?  - It is. - Uh, could it be less?  - Is this you negotiating? - I guess, yes?  Look out, Farmer. Here comes Big City.  I'd come down to $29 an ounce.  Wow, Dad. You destroyed him.  Uh, I'd have to charge, like, $20 a burger.  I don't-I don't want to be that guy.  Sorry, man. You know, you could have a look in the woods,  try to find some yourself.  - The woods? I've heard of those. - Really? Is that an option?  I heard they grow around here sometimes,  but I thought that was just a rumor.  My guys get these in Ohio,  but they might also grow in the Melville Reserve.  - Hey, we could do that. - Hunt for mushrooms?  It doesn't sound like something we'd do.  Gene, this is our chance to go out there  and fend for ourselves.  A little apocalypse practice, huh?  The two of us out there hunting and foraging  Shirts off, our boobs bouncing in the wind.  Finding fresh produce for the restaurant.  And-and you you-you are just  the right size for looking for mushrooms.  - So, come on, let's do it. - You're serious?  I thought we were just trying to impress the mushroom guy.  LINDA: Ooh, Tina.  - There's a package for you. - TINA: Oh, yeah?  Wow, first that postcard from Grandma two years ago, now this?  It's probably a refill on your puberty.  - Hey, it's my new glasses. - Whoa.  You think you can pull those off?  Aw, man, I thought we got charcoal Grey.  These are black. I was really excited about my hot new look.  Why don't you try them on, sweetie?  Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.  - One more. - Whoa.  I can see clearly now. Hey, look, the rain is gone.  Lin, remember that Woolly Neptune mushroom  - I had years ago? - I'm gonna lie and say yes.  Turns out they grow in a forest not far away.  Look, I know it's a lot to ask for you  to watch the restaurant today, but it just rained.  Yeah. And?  So we need to go, Lin. Conditions are perfect.  - Whoa. Whoa. - Okay.  You see, I'm one of those chefs that forages for food now.  Yup. We're mushroom hunters.  I'm Daddy's little piggy.  Check out our foraging basket.  Oh, yeah, I was gonna put toilet paper in there.  Ah, dreams. But wait, you got to leave now?  Yeah. It just rained. Come on, who wants in?  Who wants to go? I assume everyone.  - Oh, God, no. - (sighs) Okay.  - Um, Tina? - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.  Tina got new glasses.  - This is how she acts now. - Hmm.  But isn't there a thing where you can get really sick  if you eat the wrong mushroom?  Yeah, but did I mention we've been doing  Internet research upstairs?  Like, a solid 20 minutes' worth.  - So we're good. - I liked the pop-up ads.  One simple trick to get rid of crepey breast skin.  Look, we printed out a whole bunch  of very helpful mushroom info.  Hey, you got the printer to work.  It didn't print, like, well.  I mean, the toner's low. It's always low.  I've maybe never changed the toner, I just shook it again.  So basically the story of Hanukkah?  These are a little faded, but you can mostly read everything.  What if you get lost?  What? These two? No.  Dad, have you always had that much ear hair?  - Um, yeah, I-I think so. - I can see each one.  And there's so much going on in the nostrils. Wow.  - That's great, Tina. - Okey-doke.  We'll be back in a few minutes with Woolly Neptunes.  No, Gene, it takes an hour just to get there.  - We'll be back in, like, three hours. - Three hours?  I guess I could bring my BlackBerry  and get some work done.  BOB: Almost there.  - Probably. Maybe. - Love your confidence.  Okay, I think this is where the Internet says to park.  Do we need to get out of the car or is this a drive-through situation?  It is not, Gene.  - The plan is we get out. - Oof.  - Check our map. - (moans)  - Look for Jasper trees. - (groans)  - And low, moist valleys and gullies. - Mm.  (scat singing)  Oop! Pull up your socks there, fella.  You don't want to get ticks. No, sir. Lyme disease.  You guys want a spritz? You guys need a hit?  Uh, yeah, sure. Uh, hit us.  I (coughs) Oh, that's  - That went right in my mouth. - I'll take a spray.  - Yup. Yup. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  -That's good. I think that's enough. -There we go.  No, no, no. We're good. Thank you for the help.  - Have a great day, you two. - Thank you.  And I'm done.  - Perfect job. - Are you sure?  I see a spot you missed. Many spots.  Actually I'm not sure you got any spots.  Mm, looks pretty clean to me.  Listen, yesterday, I would have agreed with you.  But with these new glasses? It's a whole new world.  There, ketchup stain. There, relish.  - Holy crap, I can see salt. - I don't know, Tina.  Since you can see so well, maybe you should be the one to mop.  I might just not have the eyes for it.  - Hmm. I guess I should. - I guess you should.  (sighs) Man, I'll try wiping menus,  but we might need your eyes for that job, too.  Don't take it too hard, Louise. You'll find your thing.  - You think so? - Yeah, yeah.  What I wouldn't give.  GENE: Which way do we go, Pops?  - Uh this way? - JASON: Great day for a hike.  Nice basket. Forget your picnic?  Uh, we're actually, uh, hunting for mushrooms.  (laughs) No way. We're mushroom hunters, too.  Man, there is nothing like walking the mossy aisles  of the forest floor grocery store, am I right?  Exactly. I feel totally the same way.  Uh, believe it or not, it's our first time out.  Do you know where we might find any Woolly Neptunes?  (laughs)  So you just want to find the rarest, most expensive mushroom  in, like, the world your first time out.  (laughs): Sure, no problem.  Joking. It's maybe impossible.  Oh, no. Uh, really?  Yeah, we gave up looking for those things a long time ago.  So, what do you guys look for now?  Oh, tumblers, red rubies, leaves in funny shapes.  Yeah, I know all those. Um  Well, I mean, if we still wanted to look for Woolly Neptunes,  w-where do you think we'd go?  Look, it's probably not worth your time,  but we haven't checked Paradise Grove in a while,  - so maybe over there? - Yeah. I'd give,  - uh, Paradise Grove a shot. - Yeah.  - Who knows, you might get lucky. - Paradise Grove.  Uh, are there a lot of Jasper trees there?  And moist valleys and gullies?  (laughs): Look at you guys! Total pros, huh?  So, how do we get to Paradise Grove?  What you're gonna do is you're gonna follow this path here,  and then you're gonna hit a fork,  and then you go northeast along the ridge-line there.  Go northeast along the ridge-line.  I love it. I love the way that sounds.  Okay, Gene, uh, we should get going, then.  - Hey, thanks for your help. - Bye-bye.  Good luck! You're gonna need it.  - Ain't nothing where we sent you. - (both laugh)  - What's that? - Uh, we, we said, uh,  we hope you find lots of Woolly Neptunes.  Oh. Okay, then. Thanks again.  - You guys are the best. - Have fun. You're gonna follow  a big dumb path in a big dumb circle and you're not  gonna find anything and then you're gonna go home.  I'm-I'm sorry, you're pretty far away. I can't hear you.  - What'd you say, man? - Nothing. - Nothing.  Right, never mind. See you later.  - I like those guys. - I love those guys.  BOB: So then, this way  - is the way to go. - How do you know?  Well, because it's northeast,  and those guys said to go northeast.  How do you know it's northeast?  Well, (chuckles) I'll tell you, Gene.  - You see the sun? - Now I do. Thanks a lot.  As you know,  the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Wait a second. Are you a flat-earther?  No. Okay, so if the sun sets in the west,  then this is north and that is northeast,  - which is where we're headed. - (grunting)  -(gulps loudly) -Did you just pull something out of your sock and eat it?  Yeah, a cracker. We're foraging. We need our strength.  Did you not put crackers in one sock and cheese in the other?  - No. - And no chicken fingers anywhere?  - No. - Pizza bagels?  No, I put no food in my socks.  Ugh, fine, you can have some of my sock cheese.  No, thanks.  GENE: Got a little melty in my sock.  It's like fondue. Wipe, wipe, wipe.  Hey, Mom, will you try these on  and tell me if you can see super clear?  Sure. Ooh, blurry.  - Blurry? - You look like a glamorous Henry Kissinger.  Let me try yours, Linda. I'm Linda.  You can smell me all across the room.  What do you mean ""smell me""?  Like, grease or fat or whatever.  - No. - Like burgers.  No, you cook burgers, fries.  Bob's lucky. All night long, you must smell like fries.  I wonder if I can see out of these bad boys.  Whoa. Insta-headache.  - These are coming off. - Do you want to try these?  Oh, you're putting them on me. Okay.  - How do we look? - I don't know, Teddy.  - We can't see. - I can't see you. - Oh, right.  I can't believe Bob missed that.  Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  - You okay, Tina? - Kind of.  It's just These glasses only work for me.  Yeah, they're your glasses. That's what prescriptions do.  No, don't you get it? I think they're somehow combining  with my exact eyesight to give me super sharp vision.  Right. Like, maybe they're secret military-grade  and were supposed to go to some spy,  but they got sent to you accidentally.  - Yeah, maybe. - Let's see, can you read, uh,  that menu board, uh, outside Jimmy Pesto's?  I-I think it says ""charsh.""  Does it say charsh? That's weird, that's not even a word.  No. It says ""fried pizza balls.""  -(gasps) -See? I have way better than normal vision.  So you were hoping for a bit of a new look, and you got  a superpower.  Superpower is a strong word. But fair.  So, are you ready for this level of responsibility?  I was born ready. I mean, not really.  I was born a baby. And then, over time, I became more ready.  Uh, but-but now, y Um, yeah, I'm ready.  I am not seeing a lot of mushrooms so far.  Definitely not any Woolly Neptunes.  That's fun. Someone dropped a log.  Probably God.  BOB: Well, let's just hop this little obstacle.  (grunts) Nope. Little short.  I'm gonna go under. I'll meet you on the other side.  I'll be the boy that crawled on his belly  under God's log and became a man.  Ooh. Okay, I'm up.  I'm just gonna take a little rest.  Me, too. We earned it.  - See you tomorrow. - Wait, Gene.  D-Don't actually fall asleep.  Just want to close my eyes.  This is so comfortable on my face.  -Ooh, moss. -Gene, no. We have to stay awake.  (yawns) Good night, Dad.  TINA: I can see so many details.  Look at the leaves on that tree.  And the feathers on that bird.  And those butts.  I see all the creases. There's so much topography.  Wait, are those underwear lines?  Can I really see Tighty-whities right now?  Oh, man, I can. But should I?  Course you should. Shut up.  But isn't this just like someone who's invisible  and then goes into dressing rooms?  Wait, that'd be amazing.  No, stop! People are entitled to privacy.  - (shouts) - Are you all right, sweetie?  Uh, sure, yeah. Just adjusting to these new glasses.  It's a lot of responsibility.  New glasses can be, I guess.  That crack goes all the way up No.  Mm Wipe, wipe, wipe.  Hey, are we still going the way those guys told us to?  - Whoa Whoa, whoa! Whoa! - Whoa!  - (screams) - Whoa! Whoa!  (grunts) Are you okay, Gene?  Yes. Your smushiness saved me.  Hey, Dad? Are those  (whispers): It can't be.  - Moist gully - Jasper trees  Woolly greenish-blue cap.  Picture's gray-ish gray, but sure  - And an off-center stem. - Like something I know.  - And velvety blue gills? - Like something else I know.  It's a Woolly Neptune, Gene!  - Holy crap! We found it! - We found it!  And there are so many of them!  MITCHELL: Hey! You guys find something?  We found some Woolly Neptunes. A whole bunch of them.  - JASON: Are you sure? - Definitely sure.  - Wait, where are you guys? - I-I don't know.  We-we might have gotten a little lost  and then, uh, and then we got more lost.  - And then we fell. - Not your fault, though.  Your directions were great.  Hey, guys? The thing is there are a lot of lookalike mushrooms  that are really, really poisonous,  so we'll come to you and verify that yours are okay.  Oh, okay, thanks. We'll stay here, then.  - We're in a moist gully! - (whispering): Are you guys nuts?  - (both shout) - Oh, hey. Bug spray lady.  Where'd you come from?  (shushes) Listen, the last thing you want to do  when you find a treasure is blab it to the world.  Especially those guys.  (whispering): Yeah, but-but those guys are nice.  They're-they're helping us.  Oh, no, they are not.  Those guys are shady as hell.  (whispering): But they've got such a great vibe.  How'd you even find this place, anyway?  Those guys told us where to go.  Yeah, but we didn't go there, and then we fell.  Wait, did they give us directions  to a place that didn't have mushrooms on purpose?  But we messed those directions up so badly  we actually found some?  That's exactly what happened. You got to call these guys off.  Oh, okay. Um Guys?  You know what? Uh, we were wrong.  These aren't Woolly Neptunes.  They're-they're, um, they're carrots.  Wild carrots, if that's a real thing.  I think they're tangerines!  - Terrible job. - I know.  MITCHELL: Yeah, we're gonna, uh, check them out anyway.  JASON: To be safe and all. Just-just keep making sounds.  - Crap. What do we do? - (stammers) Hurry.  Pick the rest of the mushrooms real fast before they get here.  I'll help. Go. Go.  I should probably stop naming each one.  Right after you, Stewart. It's okay, Stewart.  You're gonna live with me now. And you too, Jessica Alba.  - MITCHELL: Are we getting warmer? - Oh, crap. They're so close.  (whispering): There's no time to run. You got to hide.  -(whispering): Yes, hide. Always hide. - There.  In that log.  (grunts) I feel like we're cheating on our other log.  (groans)  - How you doing, buddy? - I don't know.  I have this super ability to see,  but I feel like I should be doing more with it.  Hmm. You're just looking at butts, huh?  Yeah. It doesn't have to be saving the world,  but at least, like, fighting local crime or something.  Maybe you can fight crime.  Hey, you see that couple across the street?  Duh. Of course you can.  But with my fuzzy eyes, I can barely see them, so,  I don't know, do you think that maybe they could  - be up to something nefarious? - Nefarious?  Well, Th-they are both wearing sunglasses.  Pretty sketchy, I'd say. Do you think you could read their lips,  - see what they're saying? - I don't know.  Uh, let me try.  He's saying, ""Hey, burrito doctor,  you're late with the penguin again.""  Hmm, they must be talking in code.  - Probably spies. - Spies?  Mm-hmm. Teddy, we need you to take notes.  All right, can I borrow a pen?  Hurry, Teddy. This is important business.  Linda, pen! I need a pen. Give me a pen now!  - Okay. Why? - I don't know.  Teddy, you're getting all this, right?  What am I writing? I'm confused. What am I doing?  She's saying, ""I'm going to count from one to Annie Potts.""  He just looked over his shoulder!  - Something's about to happen! - Right, right.  This is a highlighter! Why do I have a highlighter?  - Okay, this is - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.  - Just write with a highlighter! - Ooh, you lip reading?  Okay, let's see. She's saying,  ""My father gave me this nose. It's not so bad.""  Hmm, that's not what I got, but, wait, you can see their lips?  Like, clearly?  Yeah, it's not that hard. They're right over there.  (scoffs) No, only Tina's glasses can see that far  'cause they're special.  Wait, so can you tell me what it says on  Jimmy Pesto's menu board?  It says ""fried pizza balls."" Ech.  They have them today?  I mean, they sound they don't sound so bad.  Uh, who knows how they are. Who's had 'em? I never had 'em.  I'm just gonna go outside real quick and pizza ball.  I mean, what? No!  I'm not gonna go do that because I don't even like those.  I don't I'll be back with a burnt mouth in 12 minutes.  No, I won't!  Huh. So I can't see better than everyone else?  I can just see better than me from before?  Look, the important thing is you cleaned everything  in the whole restaurant by yourself today,  and you had fun doing it.  - Did I? - You did. You really did.  Where'd you guys go?  We don't want you to eat bad mushrooms.  You could get the worst diarrhea you can possibly imagine.  (whispers): And I can imagine some pretty bad diarrhea.  Oh, hey. Are you looking for two guys,  one small? 'Cause I saw them hightailing it down that trail.  All right, let's go. Wait a minute.  Uh, hey dude, I can see your foot.  It's totally sticking out from the log.  BOB: No, it's not?  (chuckles) Guys, come on out. We're here to help.  I could've sworn you guys went on that trail  - right that-that one. - Uh  Yeah, we were, uh, we were just in that log  looking for, um, log mushrooms.  There-there weren't any.  - Whoa. - My goodness.  So these are the Woolly Neptunes you think you found, huh?  Or are they moldy strawberries? Who knows?  Oh, this is unfortunate.  You know what I'm seeing here? Tell me if you agree.  Ugh, the spore dust on the stem is concerning.  - Yeah, yeah, it should be white, - Ugh. Mm-hmm.  - But it's kind of a light blue. - Yup.  This is definitely Devil's Fur.  - Devil's Fur? - Aka Lentinellus Diaboli.  Yeah. Hate to tell you guys,  but you found a whole pot of fool's gold.  Huh. Really?  Oh, yeah. You could've gotten very sick.  Yeah, we'll just go ahead and dispose of those for you.  Huh. So these are totally worthless then?  - Yup, afraid so. - Oops.  (both gasp)  Aha! If they were worthless, you wouldn't care if I squished one.  - We don't care. - (whispering): They're faking.  Gene, we're gonna run to the car.  - Hey, guys, fetch! - Uh, that's kind of demeaning.  I still want that mushroom, though.  - Hey! - Hey, come back here!  (panting) Which way's the car?  Okay, we came into the park and then we went north.  - I got turned around - Wait!  That's one of the rocks I wiped my cheesy fingers on.  - That means the car is that way. - (chuckles)  Look at us navigating.  I mean, look at me, but sure.  - (panting) - Okay, I'm going over.  GENE: I'm going under!  (grunts, laughs) I did it!  Call me Draco Malfoy 'cause I am Slytherin!  (both panting)  BOB: Gene, there's the car!  - We made it! - Oh, no, no, no.  No, where are my car keys?  They, uh, fell out of your pocket  when you were climbing into that log.  Wait, how'd you get here so fast?  You went the long way, I went the short way.  Oh, short way. Sounds shorter.  Well, thank God you have 'em.  Oh, can I, uh, can I have 'em?  You can, but you got to give us the Woolly Neptunes first.  - We're the ""us"" part. - Yeah, us three.  But then you'd have all our mushroo Oh.  But You're on their team now? What happened?  - Y-You said they were shady. - Oh, they are.  - But so is she. - Oh, she's the worst.  The second I saw you guys with all those Woolly Neptunes,  I was wondering how I was gonna get 'em.  And then you dropped your keys and I picked 'em up.  Ooh, that was good. But you yelled so much,  and these bozos came along, so I had to cut them in.  Give us those mushrooms, or I'll we'll  take 'em from you, I guess?  Are you kidding me?  We've been looking for them for so long,  - they feel like they're ours. - Give 'em.  You guys are jerks, stealing mushrooms from strangers.  - Hey, don't judge us. - Don't steal our mushrooms.  Let's just trade before we say something we regret, okay?  (sighs) Damn it.  I just wanted to forage with my son.  - I-I don't want to fight. - You guys are lucky! If I wasn't here,  he'd do that thing where he jumps up and kicks you all  - at the same time. - I'll tell you what. I have an offer.  - Prepare to be dazzled. - There are five of us,  what if we split the mushrooms five ways?  Huh? That's fair.  No. You want your keys or what?  (sighs) Oh, fine, just take 'em  and go sell them for drugs or whatever.  Hey, just because we enjoy the outdoors  - we automatically like drugs? - Yeah. Is nature a drug?  - Is cocaine a drug? - Uh, yes, it-it is.  - Which one? - Cocaine.  That would explain why it's so expensive.  - So how are we gonna split these up? - Wh  - How about one of us picks one and then somebody - Oh, so like a draft?  -Like my fantasy football league. -(grunts)  - Oh, wait, oh! - (grunting) - Give give me  (overlapping chatter)  Oh, come on!  So see you guys around?  - Gene, let's go. - Okay, bye.  (groaning): Oh. Ugh.  Stupid delicious pizza balls.  I was so excited earlier.  I really thought I had super powers.  Tina, we've been through this.  Remember when you went up a bra size?  - Oh, yeah. - Superboobs.  The streets did feel a little safer that week.  Honey, you do have super powers.  Your super power is being the best 13-year-old kid I know.  Here she is, Super T   Taller than a tree, stronger than a rock   Can jump like a cat, cozy like a hat   Beaky like a bird, bendy like a straw   How's it go?  Fuzzy like a grape.   Come on, I'll tickle you. There she goes!  - You're my super, super Tina! - (laughs) Mom, please.  - The point is you're special. - That's a nice song.  Thanks, and even if it's not a super power,  it's nice to see you so clearly, Mom.  Aw.  I can see all those little lines on your face.  - What? - What are those called?  - Crow's feet. - Right, crow's feet.  Don't forget her laugh lines.  Oh, and look at your little mustache!  Okay, go clean the bathroom, all of you. Now. Go.  - Me, too? - No, Teddy, not you.  Okay.  (sighs) Hey, sorry I dragged you out here, Gene.  And even though those dumb jerks tried to steal all our mushrooms  and they all got smushed,  it was nice spending the day with you, pal, and  did I say all?  Because they didn't all get smooshed. L-Look!  I held onto one. Well, half of one.  Nice job, Dad! I also got a few.  This, and that, and this. This one, too.  Oh, my God, Gene, you are a very capable boy.  - I am! - If there was an apocalypse,  I bet we'd last three days with you around.  - A long weekend. - L-Let me see those.  Uh, you know what? Actually, uh, you hold 'em.  - 'Cause they were in my sock? - Yeah.  We'll-we'll-we'll cook 'em. Uh, quite a bit.  LINDA:  There she is, Super Tina   Wearing super clothes, flying 'cross the clouds   Doing helpful stuff, finding kitchen things   Corkscrew's in the drawer, gives it to her mom   There she is, Super Tina   Starin' at the butts, always at the butts   There she is, cleaning the glasses   Got to keep 'em clean, now she's spinning 'round   Her glasses gonna fall, so she cannot see   Okay, now she can see   She's Super Tina!"
"1  Tina, you're missing breakfast.  Your frozen waffles are gonna refreeze.  Mine is somehow burnt and frozen?  - It defies science. - I love Mom's waffsicles.  I'll have to take my waffsicles to go.  Dad and I have a meeting. Right, Dad?  Yep. The Thundergirls Father - Daughter Cardboard Boat Race.  Oh, yeah. You guys are doing your boat race again.  It's been a year already since the last one?  It feels like yesterday when you were taping together boxes  from the dumpster and calling it a boat.  There's a little more to it than that, Louise.  I mean, first we cut the cardboard,  and then we tape it together.  So, speaking of taping things,  I was watching a video online about how to use tape  - Go on. - And I thought maybe  you might want to watch it, too, Dad?  What do you mean, Tina? I know how to tape things together.  - ALL: Eh - BOB: Hmm.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  I mean, sure, I tape to the beat of my own drum.  But Tina, we make a great boat-building team, right?  Yeah, totally, it's just,  I'm getting up there in Thundergirl years,  and this might be my last cardboard boat race.  Aww, I remember my last cardboard boat race.  Just kidding. I did normal stuff when I was a kid.  - Hmm. - And this year,  I thought we could try something different,  like, maybe we could put on the tape really, really straight?  You know, so water doesn't get into our boat  and we don't slowly sink,  like every other year. Just a thought.  - Okay. - But don't get me wrong  Iâm excited to build a boat together.  - Are you sure? - Yeah, that's the whole point.  Father-daughter, Tina and Dad.  Or as I like to call us, ""Tad.""  - Yep, sure, yep. - Mom and I have a name, too.  We're called ""Mom Genes.""  - They fit great. - Yeah!  KAREN: Okay. For those of you  who don't know me, I'm Karen,  and I'm from the Thundergirls national office.  Some people call me Oversharin' Karen  because sometimes I get a little TMI. Like right now.  I probably didn't need to share my nickname.  - Mm. - And, uh, I am the judge  of the Father-Daughter Cardboard Boat Race.  (whoops, chuckles) Now, I might not be the judge next year  because, fingers crossed, I'm going to be promoted  to regional leader, which would be a big step for my career  and my low self-esteem. (chuckles)  - Hmm. - (whispers): Dad, shh.  Okay, let's go over some rules.  Uh, you can only use cardboard, tape and glue.  And no gadgets or gizmos or motors  or futuristic underwater robots that make you go faster.  -Question. -Can you wrap yourself in plastic,  so you don't touch any lake water and get Giardia?  - I think so? - Great.  - Uh, yes. - If we see a duck,  and the duck needs a ride somewhere, is that allowed?  That seems fine.  Look, uh, how about you gals and your dads  go over the rest of the guidelines  and we'll circle back up in five, okay?  I am very sweaty. Is anybody else sweaty?  - (whispering): Tina. - What?  Aren't those the girls who spied on your troop  and stole all your cookie customers?  TINA: Yeah, that's Troop 257.  They got banned from the jamboree, but I guess  they're allowed to come to the boat race.  Just don't make eye contact.  We can hear you.  (chuckles): Oh, hey, Patty, Rena,  all of Troop 257. So great to see  By the way, we don't do bad stuff anymore.  - Yeah. We're good now. - Total angels.  Whoa.  Yeah. Angels usually give the middle finger.  Thanks for that, Rena.  Hey, wait. Where are your dads?  - Over there in the back. - Hi, Patty-cakes!  - Don't call me that, Dad! - Sorry!  I'm just glad they let me sit near them. (chuckles)  - Uh, yeah, for now, Bethany. - More like Breath-any.  (laughter)  (laughs) Oh. Oh, you girls.  (exhales sharply) Ooh oh. Oh, boy.  Wow. They're, um, really scary, huh?  Yeah. They're terrifying.  Does that one have a tear drop tattoo?  TINA: Yeah. She draws it on meetings.  At least, I think she draws it on.  (door bells jingle)  - Hi, Mike. - Here's your mail, Linda.  Anything for me? I'm expecting a postcard from Ken.  He went fjord-hiking in Norway  and I'm fjurious at him for not inviting me.  - No, sorry kid. - Mike, do you want a coffee?  - Yes, please. - (gasps) Ooh!  The fire station open house is this Saturday.  - Ooh, no thanks. - (moans)  You kids love going to the fire station open house.  We did love going, when we were little  and we enjoyed bright, loud things.  But we have you, and you're plenty.  You guys used to love coming to the post office open house, too.  Oh wait, you never came to the post office open house.  Oh, I didn't know the post office has an open house.  - Don't pretend you're interested. - No, I'm interested.  - (sighs) - I'm interested!  - Can I just get my coffee? - Coming right up.  - Oh, we're out of coffee. - You like us.  Who's ready to make a boat?  Oh, hey. There he is. (chuckles)  Oh. Did you already cut up all the cardboard?  Yeah, it was no big deal, just something I did in the middle of the night.  Okay. So, I guess we can just start taping the sides together.  You know what? Uh, maybe I should do the taping.  Tina, it'll be fine. I'll tape it really straight.  Oh, totally, totally.  But maybe I should tape, and you should do something else.  Want to write the name of the boat on one of the side pieces?  Okay. We're going with Tad, right?  Yep. But don't write it messy.  And use bubble letters. And maybe a little bigger.  (sighs) Do you want to write it yourself?  No, that's not what I'm saying.  - Tina, you took the marker. - Uh-huh.  - You're now yeah, yeah - Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  - And now you're writing. - No, no, you write it.  - Y-You just wrote it, so we're done. - Yep.  - Great. - Good job, Dad.  - Hey, Lin. I can take over if you want - Bob, what are you doing up here?  Yeah, aren't you and Tina building your dumpster boat?  Tina seems to have everything under control.  I don't really think she really needs my help.  But I thought it was a father-daughter boat race.  Not a daughter- mopey-dad-upstairs race.  Shoot.  Bob, get your Papa Bear butt back down there.  No, I-I don't want to get in Tina's way.  I mean, she is getting older.  Maybe she doesn't need my help as much as she used to.  It's okay. My kids don't need me anymore.  - It's fine. - Aww, Bobby.  Tina still needs you.  We all do. Right, kids?  - Who, this guy? - TINA: Hey, Dad?  Tina?  - Everything okay? - I don't know what happened.  Uh, I was taping cardboard,  and the next thing I knew, tape was all over the place.  - Can you help me, Dad? - Really?  - Yeah. - Okay.  - (groans): Uh - What?  Uh, nothing. Thumbs-up.  (groans): Uh  Wow, we used a lot of tape on our boat, huh?  I guess I was a little worried about doing a bad job.  It's great. Lots of tape is great.  So what if it still isn't quite stuck together?  - Who cares, right? - KAREN: This is how you sound firm, Karen.  (deep voice): No, wait, this is how you sound firm.  - Uh, are-are you talking to us? - (regular voice): Uh oh. No.  Sorry. I was just carrying paddles and talking to myself.  - Oh, okay. - Julianne from Thundergirls National  will be here today, and she's in charge of hiring  the new regional leader, which will be me, I hope.  But Julianne told me I had to work on my firmness.  First, I thought she was talking about my abs.  And I was like, ""Rude.""  But it-it was just about my personality.  Huh. So much to take in.  I know, I know, I know. There I go again.  Less gabbing, more firmness, Karen.  Oh, that sounded firm.  Nice boat. Did you want some cardboard with that tape?  - (laughter) - Good one, Patty.  (chuckles): Okay, girls. Let's be nice.  - This is us being nice! - Okay, okay.  Wow, they're intense, huh?  No, I think you did a great job taping the boat.  - What? - What? Nothing.  Let's keep walking. Here we go.  You know what's weird about the farmers market,  I've never seen them sell even one farmer.  Why are we going to the farmers market, again?  I told you. Because we need more food.  You know, for cooking. Oh. Oh, look.  It's the fire station, and they're having their open house.  You're a liar! You're not taking us to the farmers market at all.  - Okay. Okay - You're teaching us to lie!  All along I was like, ""You were born bad,""  but it's not, it's the nurturing!  Stop with the dramatics.  Mom, we don't want to go to the fire station open house.  It's not for us, it's for little kids.  Oh, the firefighter wants us to go in.  - Come on. Let's go in. - (both) Nooooo!  Great, here we go.  KAREN: This is impressive craftsmanship,  - Patty. - No crap, Sherlock.  All right, Troop 257, you guys all pass inspection.  You and your dads can take your boats to the starting line.  Wait. Where are your dads?  Picnic table. They like it there.  Oh, my God, they're looking at us. Hi!  (groans)  Time for your boat inspection.  Then it's time for me to have a snack.  Glad I brought whatever these are.  I'll call them raisins.  - Nope, they're not raisins. - Okay.  Hmm. A lot of tape.  - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah.  Well, this looks legit to me.  You can move it to the starting line.  All right. Team Tad passing inspection.  Yeah. Phew. Ready, Dad?  - Oh, no! Oh, my God. - Oh. Uh, uh-oh.  - (hyperventilating) - Don't-don't worry.  Tina, we can fix this.  - I-I think. - RENA: Help!  - What was that? - RENA: I need everyone's help right now!  Oh, no. That's Rena's voice.  A squirrel stole my sash with all my   RENA: and it ran up this tree so I went after it but now I'm stuck.  (panting): Rena, I'm gonna get you down from there.  How did a squirrel take her sash? I-I don't get it.  - Yeah, Dad, you don't get it! - Wait.  Do you think I'm siding with the squirrel? 'Cause I'm not.  I mean, I'd like to hear its side of the story  Our boat is a piece of poop!  - Tina. - I shouldn't have let you help!  I should've just done it all myself!  You ruined the boat!  And now Team Tad is Team Bad.  - Whoa. - Ooh. - Yikes.  Maybe you should sit with the other dads.  With those sad dads at the picnic table?  Maybe it's for the best. I'm gonna go cool off.  Hey, you've got other kids, right?  BOB: Thanks, Harley. Appreciated.  Isn't this fun? Look at the big trucks!  Yep. That's the fire house for you.  How about a helmet and a sticker for our junior firefighters?  Ooh, helmets and stickers.  -(groans) -Let me get a picture of you guys.  Smile and say ""Backdraft!""  Actually, miss, back drafts are a very serious threat to firefighters.  They're nothing to smile about.  Oh. Billy Bummer over here.  Mom, maybe we should call it.  There's not much for us to do here.  Unless we could play with the hoses?  Sorry, I can't let you play with the hoses.  Is there a calendar I can pose for?  Actually, we shot the calendar last week. I'm April.  I'm gonna call you April Showers.  I-I don't love ""ril Showers.""  - You will. - Well, that's that.  - Gene, shall we? - No, we're not leaving.  Gene's got to put on a coat that's too big for him.  - It'll be adorable. - (chuckles): That is always cute.  (Gene moans)  (muttering): Stupid tape, can't tape  What the  You can't even tell which boat is which.  - Except that one has a motor. - (laughter)  - (gasps) Oh, my god! - Huh?  Hi, guys.  Just checking if this leaf is poisonous.  Nope. Safe to eat.  - Tina, are you spying on us? - No! Sorry.  I was just walking along, um,  and I didn't mean to see you switching your boat  for one that looks exactly like it but has a motor on it and  Wait a minute, you're cheating. Why am I apologizing to you?  Patty, what do we do? Should we kill her?  - What? No! - No. Listen, guys, Tina caught us.  Guess you're gonna have to go tell Karen.  Yeah, I am.  - You are. - And don't try to stop  Oh, we won't.  Okay. This isn't going how I expected.  Should we exchange phone numbers or hug it out or ?  - No. Yuck. - Right, right, right.  (panting) Whoo.  Okay, everyone, let's head back to the lake.  Karen! I have to tell you something.  Was my underwear showing when I was climbing down the tree?  I wore my Thursdays 'cause my Saturdays  had a case of the Mondays, if you know what I mean. (chuckles)  No, I-I don't know what you mean,  but, listen, Patty has two boats.  One is the boat you inspected  and the other boat looks exactly the same,  but has a motor attached,  and she's gonna race with the motorboat.  Oh, my God,  that is terrible.  - I know, right? - Oh, they are big trouble.  But let's wait until after the race to punish them.  Yeah. Wait, what?  Yeah. Uh, Julianne isn't here yet.  She's running late, and Julianne would love to see them punished,  so, uh (chuckles) let's wait, okay?  - Um - Now, if you'll excuse me,  I scraped both my nipples on the way down the tree  and I'm gonna go put some lip balm on them in my car.  Okay, be careful. That stuff's addictive.  Look who's getting a little tour  of all the rooms in the firehouse. Pretty neat, huh?  Mother, please, we really should leave.  I mean, we're old enough to be these kids' parents.  This is the kitchen. Joey's making ribs.  Interested. Keep talking.  And over here is our screening room.  (gasps) Are they watching The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel  while they wait for ribs? Is this heaven?  - Oh, hey, Captain. - Ooh, look kids,  it's the captain of the fire station. He's in charge.  - Yes, hi. Captain Davis. - Sir, yes, sir!  I'm not that kind of captain.  (sighs) So sorry about her.  And you're paddling and you're paddling and you're  Guys, I have to tell you something.  Oh, hey, Tina. Sorry your boat fell apart.  Troop 257 has another boat that looks exactly like Patty's  and has a motor and Karen doesn't seem to care and  - you're not listening. - What?  Sorry, Tina. (grunting) I'm practicing my paddling.  You got this, Harley.  But 257 is gonna cheat.  Are you sure, Tina? Seems like they're better now. (grunting)  Uh-oh! There's a duck who wants a ride.  -What're you gonna do? -Uh, uh, I get him on real quick,  - but I don't break my stride. - That's my girl.  Tina, are you maybe a little jealous  because your boat fell apart?  What? No! You guys  We saw the way you yelled at your dad about your boat.  That was rough.  - Yeah. - (sighs) Forget it.  Harley, there's a goose. He hates ducks. What do you do?  Go for the neck! (grunting) Keep my stride!  So you don't think these socks are too high?  No, I-I think they're great.  Uh, Dad? Uh, can I talk to you for a second?  Sure. Uh, are you, are you gonna yell at me again?  No, I, no, I just need to talk to you  about something that's important.  Your daughter wants to talk to you? Way to go, man.  And Karen doesn't seem to care, and I tried to tell my troop  and they thought I was being jealous.  Huh. What you're saying kind of makes sense.  - It does? - Yeah. I mean, didn't Karen say  that she was trying to prove she was firm or something?  Yeah. I mean, she says a lot a lot of things.  Like, so many things.  Well, what if Karen didn't want to punish Troop 257  until Julianne got here hat Karen could look firm  in front of Julianne to get that promotion?  And what if she didn't care about the cheating  because she knew it was gonna happen the whole time  because she's working with Troop 257.  Oh, my God! You think?  (sighs) I mean, it sounds crazy.  Troop 257 is crazy. That's their thing.  - So what do we do? - Hm I-I don't know.  Um, somehow magically switch the boats back  without getting caught and ruin their plan?  - Yes! - Oh.  I mean, I don't know how we'd even do that.  It seems really hard.  Dad, Karen is working with Troop 257  and no one is stopping them.  Switching their boats back is our only hope. Please?  Okay, let's do it.  - Dad? - Yeah?  I'm really sorry I yelled at you  and called you crappy tape hands.  It's all right, Tina. When did you call me crappy tape hands?  In my head I did,  and I said you probably failed out of tape school.  - Oh, that's harsh. - I know.  Okay, now let's do one with your hands over your ears  - like the siren's too loud. - KIDS: No.  Come on, you guys used to love sitting in the truck. Remember?  Ma'am, maybe it's time to give someone else  a turn in the truck. I mean, you've been here for a while.  All right.  Maybe we can go upstairs and help the fellas serve the ribs?  Eh, the guys don't want you back upstairs  till they're done with Mrs. Maisel.  You kind of spoiled some of it for them.  No, no, I-I was just saying I thought that thing at the end  - was gonna be - Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no!  D-Don't say anything. I haven't seen it yet.  Aw, look at that big happy smile.  Maybe I can photo-paste it onto Louise and Gene.  - Here, look at me, look at me. - (phone camera clicks)  Ugh. Is mom wishing we were little kids again or something?  Oh, yeah. I've seen this a lot with parents  Classic case of wanting to turn back time.  Ah. So what do we do?  The longer she stays, the worse she'll get.  - You-you got to take her home. - We've tried.  Can we, like, call in a fire or something? Then she'd have to leave.  No, we can't fake an emergency.  - Damn it. - (groans)  But we could turn on the lights and pull out of the driveway  and do a loop or two, and if you happen to tell your mom  that we had an emergency call, that's your business.  - Genius. - We are on it, Chief.  - I'm a captain, not a chief. - Don't sell yourself short.  You think our plan is going to work?  Maybe. I mean, honestly, I'd be surprised.  But let's just hope for the best.  - DADS: Hey! - Hm?  PATTY'S DAD: Everyone come see us!  - Who's that? - That sounds like my dad.  Mine, too.  - Ready? - Ready. (panting)  I can't believe you convinced all those dads to climb the tree  to get their daughters' attention.  Yeah. I mean, I-I kind of just copied Rena's plan.  Plus, they are pretty desperate.  PATTY'S DAD: Hi, honey!  Isn't this cool?  What are you guys doing up there?  Check this out. Oh, God.  Look, there's Patty's not-motor boat.  Um, what's going on?  -Bethany? What are you doing here? -Oh, boy.  Peeing in the woods, or on the woods,  depending on how you look at it.  What are you two doing with Patty's boat?  BOTH: Uh  We were just checking to see if this boat was poisonous.  Nope. (chuckles)  Wait, hold on. You're switching back Patty's cheater boat  that has a motor on it for her legal boat  that's hidden in the woods?  Sort of. I mean, yeah. That's exactly what we're doing.  'Cause you think Karen is in on their plan to cheat  so that she can look tough busting 257  - in front of Julianne and get promoted? - Yes.  - I'm gonna help you. - What? - Huh?  Listen, if the girls and Karen are in cahoots, that's not good  If Karen gets the regional leader job,  she can decide which troops get which cookie routes.  She'll give 257 all the best routes.  But wouldn't you like that?  I mean, you're their troop leader.  I am, but it's always about cookies with those girls.  What about songs? What about basket weaving?  What about tie-dye? Ugh! There's so much more to life.  What I don't get is why Karen is okay with them cheating.  I mean, I know she really wants to be regional leader,  but that's so wrong.  (gasps) Because they have something on her.  I overheard some of the girls say that, last year,  at the cookie pickup, they got Karen talking  and she told them she kept a lost pug  instead of returning it to its owner.  - Whoa. - Yeah.  She even cut off its collar and dyed him blond.  That sounds cute, but messed up.  The race is starting soon.  We got to move if we're gonna stop 'em.  Let's boat block those B's.  Okay, kids, I'm gonna pretend I'm a fire  and you put me out, okay?  - (babbling) - (bell ringing)  DISPATCH (over P.A.): Flames reported on the corner of Elm Lane.  Calling all vehicles in the area.  Wow. I had my doubts this would work,  but you guys are really selling it.  This is an actual emergency. You need to leave immediately.  It's us. You don't have to pretend with us.  I'm not pretending.  (laughs) Oh, my God, you're an incredible actor.  You should get an agent and an entertainment lawyer.  This isn't an act!  (sirens wailing)  - Whoo! - Yeah!  Should we wait till they come back?  KIDS: No!  Tina, how's Tad feeling?  I think it's actually gonna hold. Thanks, by the way.  Of course.  Okay, girls.  Julianne, do you want to do the honors?  Sorry it smells like onions.  I had an everything bagel and a whole onion.  (sniffs) Oh, it does. Ready,  - set, go! - (girls grunting)  - What's happening? - The motor's not working.  Just paddle and-and get to the end.  You can still get in trouble for having a motor  even if you didn't use it. Just try to win.  How's it going, Patty. Boat troubles?  Oh, beat it, Thunder-dork.  BOB: Oh, my God, they're neck and neck. Go, Tina!  - I came in second! - You came in second!  What the ?  - Congratulations, young lady. - A-ha!  Caught red-handed. Motors are not allowed  Wait, what? It, uh It's here. It, uh (chuckles) It must be.  Well, it's not, Karen.  Let's just assume there's a motor somewhere here on this boat,  and, uh, Patty, you're busted. I'm firm. The end.  Um, Karen, what are you talking about?  Someone's getting a promotion. That's what I'm talking about.  Right? (chuckles)  Whatever is happening right now is kind of making me  - strongly consider other candidates. - That makes sense.  And you should know you have two greasy spots on your uniform.  It's lip balm.  Patty, congratulations for winning and not cheating.  You switched my boat back, didn't you?  Yeah, I did. We did. Checkmate, Patty-cake.  - Hm, good one. - Thanks, Dad.  Did you win a trophy, honey?  - Yeah, you want it? - You want me to have it?  Yeah, sure, whatever. Let's get out of here.  - Can I give you a hug? - No!  - I got to hug someone. - Oh. Um, okay.  - I'm so proud of you, honey. - Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry I dragged you to the fire station open house.  It wasn't all bad. I liked when they kicked us out.  I guess I was just missing the old days,  but you're right, you outgrew it.  Aw! You guys are holding my hands.  - Oh. Whoops, sorry. - No, no, I like it! I like it!  Ow! Mom, you're hurting me.  Oh, it feels so good to squeeze you!  - BOB: Hey, guys. - You're back. How was it?  (singsongy): Guess who won second place?  It was me and Dad.  Wow! Go Team Tad! All right!  Why are you guys wearing fire hats?  We went to the fire station open house. Jealous?  - Have you been gone all morning? - Yeah.  So, no one's been working at the restaurant.  - Nope. - Great.  I guess we don't need money today.  Hey, you want to get in on this? Tina, take Louise's hand.  - Bob, you grab Gene's. - One of them had a booger on it,  the other did not. Just kidding! They both had boogers on them.  - Ugh, Gene. - Yay! Family hand-holding!  Yessa!  (""Hot Hot Hot"" by Buster Poindexter playing)  LINDA:  And a-rum bum bum   And a-bum bum bum   Yes, girls   Me mind on fire, me soul on fire   Feeling hot, hot, hot   Who's hot?   Party people all around me   Feeling hot, hot, hot   What to do."
"1  GENE: Then that young man looked down  at his crotch and said ""Hello, ween.""  And that, my friends, was the birth of Halloween.  - Is that true? - A thousand percent.  Bob, what do you think?  - Bob? - What? What?  Sorry. My hearing's all messed up.  I think my ears are still kind of clogged from that cold.  Oh, boy. Poor old thing's too proud to say he's going deaf.  (shouting): Just be deaf, Dad! It's fine!  It's natural for your age!  - Stop. - Oh, Tina,  isn't today the day your class dissects those fetal piggies?  Oink, oink, oink, oink. (snorts) Oink, oink, oink, oink!  Ugh. Yes, don't remind me.  Tina, dissecting a fetal pig is, like, the one cool thing  you have going on right now.  Okay, can we move on to more important stuff?  Guys, tell me honestly. Do I look like someone  who would be fun to have on a haunted hayride?  What haunted hayride, honey?  Tammy invited a bunch of eighth graders  to go on a haunted hayride on Halloween.  I asked if I could go too, and she said,  ""Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,"" and walked backwards away from me.  That jerk-o-lantern.  Isn't that hayride for, like, little kids?  And farmers?  And people who like to say ""Hay-ay!""  Yeah, but Tammy's cousin who's in high school  She went on it last year with a bunch of her friends  - and things got kissy. - GENE: Mmm.  And Jimmy Junior will be there, probably in denim overalls  with no shirt underneath and one of the straps down,  'cause that makes sense given the situation,  and we'll sit next to each other all night,  our pumpkins bumping together.  - Tina, I don't think Dad caught that last part. - Oh, sorry.  (loudly): I said our pumpkins will be bumping together!  Yup. Great. Got it.  TEDDY: So I said, ""You owe this  to yourself, Teddy."" So I did it.  I bought the tissues with the lotion in 'em. The end.  I told you that story would be worth it, huh, Bob?  - Bob? - Oh, yeah.  I-I I definitely heard all that.  Bob, I need a burger of the day, but add pickle.  Bob? Hello?!  Huh? Oh. Um, hi?  (groans) I really need you to hear things, Bob.  Maybe you just need to say more exciting things,  like my lotion tissue story.  Teddy, shush, shush, shush.  Okay, here's an old trick to clear your ears  I learned from my Uncle Donny who learned it in prison.  Now, hold your nose and swallow, and try to gargle, like this.  (makes gargling sounds)  Okay. (makes gargling sounds)  (both make gargling sounds)  Well, I don't want to be the only one not doing it.  (makes gargling sounds)  (all making gargling sounds)  It's not working.  - (all making gargling sounds) - Oh, my face!  - Oh, my God. - LINDA: Did that just come out of your ear?!  - Yes. - Wow.  - Bob, are you dying? - I don't know. Maybe?  It's so big and waxy.  I'm gonna keep it.  It's not brain, right? Let's say no.  So who should I make out with on the hayride  Jason Kozlowski or Davey Russo?  Well, ""Davey"" rhymes with ""gravy,"" so maybe Jason?  - Oh, my God, good point. - Hey, Tammy?  Any word on availability vis-Ã -vis the hayride?  'Cause I don't have to take up that much space. Check this out.  (Tina grunting)  Is she trying to fart?  MISS JACOBSON: Okay, class,  I'm gonna start passing out the fetal pigs.  Tina, Angela is sick today, so no partner for you, I'm afraid.  Probably got swine flu, am I right?  (laughs) Oh, God. Sorry.  I joke when I'm nervous about dissecting pigs.  It's good, Zeke. It releases the tension.  Excuse me, Miss Jacobson?  I have a note from my mom that says  I don't have to do this 'cause it seems gross.  And I can forge a note right now that says that, as well.  You're all dissecting a pig,  and there will be a test on fetal pig anatomy tomorrow.  - (students groaning, muttering) - ZEKE: Dang.  Aw, he's so cute! He's sleeping.  Thank you.  - Whoa. - JOCELYN: Ew.  Tina's pig is nasty,  and it's scaring our pig who's trying to rest.  Yeah, that little piggy went to the market,  and everybody there threw up and died.  He's got weird, ugly hairs on his chinny chin chin.  - Right, J-Ju? - Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, Zeke. It feels good to laugh.  Jeez, guys, I know he's dead,  but I feel like it's not very nice to, you know?  Ugh. Making fun of things or people is always fun.  It's right there in the name.  (quietly): We don't need that kind of energy on the hayride.  Um I mean look at this dead idiot.  Talk about a puke-chop, am I right?  - JIMMY JR.: Ha. - More like wham, bam, no thank you, ham.  - (laughter) - I mean, whatever.  Okay, enough.  - Aah! - Everything okay, Tina?  Uh yup. Let's get dissecting.  Hey, Tina.  Crazy how gross your pig was, huh?  Uh, yeah. Crazy.  Yeah then you called him ""puke-chop,"" and I was like  (high-pitched): ""Nailed it.""  Uh sure. Yup.  Hey, you should come with us on the hayride.  People say it's for little kids,  but we're making it an eighth grade thing.  Having that fall fun, girl!  - So, Tammy, can Tina come? - Ugh!  I guess we have an opening now that Harriet found out  she's allergic to hay for some stupid reason.  She should just stop eating it.  So, fine. Tina can come.  Oh. Great! Thanks, Tammy!  Thanks a whole lot.  What? Tina, what?  - Tina, what is it? - Oh, nipple. I mean, nothing.  Guess who's going on the haunted hayride?  - It's me. Tina. - Aw, that's great, Tina.  My little hayseed.  It turns out all I had to do to get invited was impress  the other eighth graders by making fun of my fetal pig.  Huh. Teenagers are odd.  And I feel totally fine about it 'cause it's just a dead pig,  and I'm a human girl going on a romantic hayride.  Aren't those the lyrics to a Taylor Swift song?  All right, all right, all right, enough about your day.  A giant ball of wax fell out of your Dad's ear!  KIDS: Whoa!  Dad, are you dying?  Why does everyone keep saying that?  I took pictures of it.  There's the wax next to a quarter.  There's the wax next to a tomato.  And there's Teddy pretending the wax just said something really funny.  What else do you think is inside Dad right now?  Well, I'm betting there's something in that other ear.  There is. I think.  That's why I want to go in with the ear syringe.  - But here's the problem. - (whimpers)  Stop! I'm doing the gargle thing.  (makes gargling sounds)  I'm telling you, it's not working on that ear.  - We got to go to the syringe level. - I don't like stuff near my ears.  Unless it's wax. Or hair.  Or a juicy secret.  You'll see. You'll all see.  When you get old and your body starts  to make weird balls of things that fall out of you,  I'm gonna be there laughing at you!  Aw, honey, we'll be dead.  But we can laugh at them from heaven.  I look forward to it!  (Bob snoring)  (shrieking, whimpering)  (quietly): Linda, stop it. Stop it.  Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.  Good night.  I love you.  MALE VOICE: Tina?  Tina?  (snorting)  (snorting)  - (snorting) - Ah!  - Aah! - (snorting)  (Tina yells)  I'm hogging the covers. Get it? Hog?  Aah! Yes, I get it! Aah!  - (snorts) - (thuds)  You okay, Tina?  - You were shouting. - Uh yeah.  I thought there was a scary pig in here, but there's not.  Well, there's one in my room.  His name's your dad. Ha!  Just kidding. Now go back to bed.  I'm gonna go pee.  Ah, good for you, sweetie.  (snorting)  I'm your toilet now, Tina.  (yells, grunts)  Aah! This little piggy's going crazy!  - Louise? Louise? - (gasps)  Oh, cool. You're up. So, you want to hang out? What's new with you?  Tina, what are you doing here? Go back to your bed.  Your boobs are taking up all the room.  I can rearrange them.  What's with all the angry whispering?  I'm trying to have a nice midnight charcuterie.  (sighs) I had a nightmare that the fetal pig  I dissected is trying to get me.  Uh-oh. Sounds like someone's getting haunted.  - What?! Oh, no! - Hmm.  Haunted by a dead pig.  Why does that sound familiar?  I was haunted by a red wig after I saw Annie.  Ah! Aku No Kuriketto, volume ten.  There's a seishin dobutsu A demon spirit   That can possess dead animals to attack people who wronged them.  Sounds like my ex-wife. Just kidding. She's great.  Is this 'cause I made fun of him?  - Can't demons take a joke? - Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.  Demons are known for being really cool about everything.  What do I do? I can't go back to sleep.  Those dreams were so real.  Oh, God. How do I know I'm not dreaming right now? Ow.  - Did you feel that? - Yes.  - So you're probably awake. - Ow.  - And one more time. - Ow.  - Yeah, the system works. - Hey, hey, hey.  Everyone go to bed. This isn't a family slumber party.  Those are Friday nights, and I'm invited. Go. Bed. Now.  Ooh, cheese. (eats noisily)  - Aah! - LINDA: Tina! Breakfast!  Whoa! Honey, rough night?  Is it 'cause you're dreams are being haunted  by that pig goblin? Louise told us.  Pig demon, Mom.  I'm sorry about your nightmares, Tina.  I didn't sleep that well myself.  I was so worried your mom was gonna attack me  that I tied a T-shirt around my head.  You just wait, Bob. I'm gonna get ya.  - Linda, please. - I'm gonna get ya.  I'm moving out.  TINA: Got to stay awake. Got to stay awake.  Just picture yourself on the hayride with Jimmy Junior,  and hay is going everywhere.  Oops, I dropped my pencil.  TINA: Okay, this could work.  - Here it is. - Aah!  FETAL PIG: Tina.  Oh, no!  Tina!  - What's shakin', bacon? - Go away!  (muttering) Go away.  Whoops. There goes the liver.  (grunts) Small intestine.  I don't even know what that is, do you?  No, I don't! Spleen, maybe?  (grunting)  Aah!  Oh, my God,  - she's a really bad test-taker. - (panting)  TINA: We got to figure out how to get rid of this thing.  Okay, okay, save the drama for when you're in your pajamas.  Ooh! Seishin dobutsu appeasement rituals.  Clicking. Let's see.  So, first you got to make sure the whole animal is intact.  Oh, that's great, 'cause I took out all the organs.  Then you got to put a drop of your blood inside the animal  as an offering for your wrongdoing.  Well, that just makes sense.  Then you bind it with the strongest twine,  and you bury it in the woods.  Like hikers do with their poop.  We'll do it after school, and you'll be sleeping  like a not-haunted baby tonight.  Oh, seishin dobutsu haunting, huh?  That's my 20s in a nutshell.  Mort, you brought it?  - I brought it! - Brought what?  My otoscope so Linda can look in your ear.  But aren't those for doctors?  You just mess around with dead bodies all day. No offense.  I just want to know what I'm dealing with.  Check all the holes. Don't want any surprises, you know?  What comes out of the holes?  Shh. Linda, no.  Well, nobody's sticking anything in my ear.  Bob, I just want to see what's in there.  It'll be just like at the doctor,  but we've both seen each other naked.  - Now, come on. - (sighs) Fine.  Wait. Has your ear doctor seen you naked?  Shh. Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush!  - Come here. - (high-pitched): Aah   Oh, yeah. Look at that. It's a beast.  Ooh, let me see, let me see.  Uh  Is it pulsating?  Ooh, I want to see.  Oh, God. Get out of there!  Get out of my friend and go back to hell!  All right, I I want to see it.  You do?  Well, uh, uh, we could take a picture.  Mort, hold the thingie.  - Okay, here we go. - (camera shutter clicks)  - Brace yourself. - Oh, dear Lord.  It's not your fault. It's not your fault.  Okay. I want it out.  Yes! Let's get that son of a bitch.  - Yeah! - Yeah!  No, no, no, no. Not here.  L-Later. In the apartment.  -Oh. -Oh. -Oh.  Yes, apartment's better, thank you.  Thank you for that.  LOUISE: Okay, apparently the fetal pigs  and organs and stuff are in that dumpster.  So, uh, just pop on in, find your pig,  shove the organs back in real quick. There ya go.  Won't the organs be all mixed around?  - How will I know which ones are his? - Take your best shot.  The important thing is he knows we're making an effort.  But, you know, try to get it right.  - Now, scoot. - (groans)  I feel good about this.  (grunts) I'm okay.  - (gagging) - (rustling, metal clanking)  Okay, here are the pig organs.  (gagging): There's a heart.  And a kidney, I think.  -(gagging): Oh, God. - GENE: You're gonna smell so cool after this.  Well, I'll just say it: that pig makes a really fun clutch purse.  Okay, Tina, let's prick that finger,  'cause it's getting to be trick or treat o'clock.  And it's getting to be hay o'clock ride.  Hayride time for me soon.  - I'm so tired. - Now give me your hand.  Gonna prick your finger  get some blood out.  Kinda weird when you think about it.  - Okay, did I do it? - Nope.  Oh, let me push a little harder.  - Did I do it? - Nope.  Let me push a little harder.  - Did I do it? - Nope.  Um, maybe there's no blood in that one. Let me try this one  - Just give me that. - Okay.  Now bind him and bury him.  - (yawning): All right. - Worst pig roast ever.  FETAL PIG: Hey, Tina.  What are you doing? Why am I wrapped in this twine?  I mean, it is slimming and I appreciate it, but why?  Aah! Shut up, shut up.  (yawning): Shut up, shut up.  You're burying me?  This is not cool, Tina.  You are being a total turd right now.  - You're being a turd. - You're being a turd.  (sleepily): You're being a turd.  I feel like I should slap her awake,  but I also want to see how this argument plays out.  You're being a turd and I'm getting rid of you for good!  FETAL PIG: Tina, no!  Turd .  We did it. I'm free.  Yeah. Hooray, congrats, yeah.  Let's go home, okay? Mama's hungry.  Time to eat some nougat and then make some nuggets.  LINDA: Trick or treat. Move those feet.  Costume fashion show for me.  Louise is going as a  well-dressed person who can't find their baby.  Ugh, no, Mom, I'm the Bjorn Identity.  Oh, got it, got it, got it.  And Gene a jar lady.  Close. I'm Fiona Applesauce.  Fiona Apple's saucy aunt. Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm.  Aw, you must be so proud of your niece.  And Tina is going as  someone about to slip into a coma?  Tina, your mom's right, you should go lie down.  Go lie down? And miss the hayride?  Hay'll no!  - Whoa. - Okay, fine. Go.  Everybody go. Have fun.  (singsongy): I've got something special planned  for your father.  You're a lucky man, Dad.  (yawning): Isn't this nice, Jimmy Jr.?  You, me, the hay  Look, a skeleton on a tractor.  Spooky. (laughs)  He must've died of excessive crop Dustin'.  (makes fart sound) Right, J-Ju?  (laughs) I bet he did, Zeke.  I heard skeletons are inside all our bodies every day.  Okay, kids. Let's just have fun  appreciating all the work that went into this.  Can I have some of your blanket, Jimmy Jr.?  Uh, sure. I mean, you're already under one.  Also, maybe you should've dressed better for the weather?  Hey, there's a skeleton churning butter.  Go to the store, skeleton. (laughs)  Yeah, this hayride is so stupid.  - Let's all make out. - (kissing sounds)  Well, should we take a whack at this whole kissing thing?  Huh? Oh. Okay, sure.  (quietly): All my hayride dreams are coming true.  - What? - Nothing.  (quietly): We're making a magical memory.  Sorry, Tina, did you say something?  Shh, shh, shh.  - (kissing sounds) - Jimmy Jr.,  you have more whiskers than normal.  Mm. And more nostrils than usual?  - (screaming) - (laughs maniacally, snorts)  Is the formaldehyde smell me or you?  (gasping)  What the hell? You're supposed to be gone.  Well, now I'm back, baby back ribs.  -(cackling) -(screaming) -Oh, my God!  I got you, J-Ju. I got you, boy.  (snoring)  I don't know, we were gonna kiss  and then she just fell asleep.  Hmm. We should probably write  ""dinglebooby poopy butt"" on her forehead.  Anybody have a pen?  No? Seriously?  Who doesn't bring a pen on a hayride? (scoffs)  Okay, let's just make out. (kissing sounds)  LINDA: Okay, Bobby   - Come on in. - Whoa.  I put a bowl of Halloween candy outside  for the trick-or-treaters so we won't be interrupted.  Why are you wearing your nightgown?  It's, like, 7:30.  I just wanted you to be relaxed.  Come lay on the bed.  Come on, lay on the bed.  Okay, first I'm gonna put some drops in your ear,  and then we're gonna wait 15 minutes,  and then we're gonna flush your ear out with the syringe.  Oh Kay.  Are you turned on?  - No. - You are.  - A little bit. - Do I, uh, need a safe word?  No. Maybe.  (panting)  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  (groans) I need some help here.  Allow me.  - (grunts) Nothing. - Yeah.  You're on a snooze cruise.  You guys, the pig is back. We didn't get rid of him.  What? If you can't trust the Internet  for pig demon appeasement rituals, then what's the point?  Wait, does this mean we're in your dream?  Yes. I think so.  I thought there'd be more horses.  - Oh, there's one. - (horse whinnies)  So, if we're in your dream,  can't we be, like, anything?  - I don't know. Maybe. - Like, I could have  nine arms sticking out of my back?  And also, two arms for legs?  Um, okay, sure.  Nice. This feels right.  Gene, what about you?  Ooh. I want some applesauce.  Really? You could do anything and you want applesauce?  Yes. Ever since I put on this outfit.  But fine, just make my whole body applesauce.  That's badass.  Yeah.  Tina, if you can make Gene applesauce,  then why not just dream the pig away?  Great idea, Louise  Don't you think I'd do that if I could?  Okay, okay.  Let me and all my arms think for a minute.  Hmm  Seems like the only way to go  is to trap him  and then turn him into pork chops.  Oh, I'd go great with that.  I mean, trapping him sounds good.  - But what would we use? - (banjo music plays)  LOUISE: Huh. Is that supposed to be scary?  That's kinda the vibe of this whole place.  Lotta skeletons doing helpful things around the farm.  Okay, Tina, I need you to use your dream powers  to make me a wig that looks like your hair,  a shirt that looks like your shirt,  and glasses that look stupid. I-I mean that look like yours.  And Tina's trademark Kangol hat!  It's time to show this sausage who's the bossage.  Okay, Bobby, up, up.  Tilt your head to the side.  Let's see what kind of ear nugs we got.  I just want my life back.  - Huh. There should be way more. - Mm.  Oh, it's still in there!  It outwitted the oil.  - Now it's laughing at me. - Oh, no.  I'm coming for you, you wax bastard!  - Don't you laugh at me. - Linda, you're scaring me.  This is my white wax whale, Moby Ear Dick, Bob.  So demon pig comes along and sees wait for it  (gasps) a perfect replica of Tina.  He jumps in the coffin, the lid closes,  we run over, sit on the coffin, pig trapped. Done.  Then we trap the pig's parents.  - Pig parent trap. - (gasps) There he is.  - (coffin lid opening) -    (pig laughs maniacally)  Now.  Ha, ha! We got him.  How do you like them apples sauce?  - And you're welcome. - Okay, but we should probably  put a big rock on top just to be safe.  Aah!  - Aah! - I'm flushin' you out, wax.  I'm comin' for you!  (whimpering)  (panting)  Oh, I'm Tina. Bang, bang, bang. (laughs, snorts)  Ah, stop right there.  Skeleton Banjo Tina, attack!  Damn it! Why won't you just leave me alone?  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  You think I'm doing this to you?  No, no, no. You're doing this to you.  You gave into peer pressure and made fun of me,  and you felt really guilty about it,  and this is what your brain did.  Ow. Huh. I guess that sounds like something  my brain would do.  (sighs) I'm sorry we were mean to you.  Can I make it up to you somehow?  Want, to hang out?  - Like, socially? - Yeah.  Like boyfriend-girlfriend?  - Oh, I-I mean - (snorts) Just kidding.  How 'bout you just give me that hat?  Uh, okay.  - Oh, it-it looks good on you. - Yeah it does.  You're a good kid, Tina. Goodbye.  Goodbye, Mr. Fetal P Aah!  Welcome back, Sleeping Tooty.  And, yes, that was Tina farting before,  not me farting and blaming it on Tina.  I don't know, Tammy, you kept waving the edge of your blanket.  - I felt one on my leg. - That was a ghost.  That ghost needs a doctor.  Okay, kids. That's the end of the line.  You take care. Bye, now.  Skeleton arm! Surprise end scare.  Oh, my God, that is so embarrass  So great.  It's great, Tractor Driver Guy.  Y-Your skeleton arm's great, all-all the  skeletons doing farm chores are great.  - TAMMY: No, I'm saying it's dumb. - You know who else is great?  My fetal pig, yeah.  The one I made fun of to seem cool.  Well, I was wrong.  Because that fetal pig is the one who's cool.  He's-He's a really cool dude who looks great in hats.  - Oh, and one more thing. - What? (grunts)  - Okay, now I'm done. - Oh, hell, yeah!  Now that's a hayride.  - (farting) - That was Jocelyn!  LOUISE: I haven't been chewing for, like,  ten minutes. Just swallowing.  Like a pelican.  Ding. My warm Snickers is ready.  How was your night, Tina?  Well, Mom, I learned a little about life  and a lot about mysel (snoring)  Oof. Lot of drool. Like, immediately.  LOUISE: Dad, what about you Is your ear still full of strange?  Well, we did our darndest,  but we couldn't beat the beast.  But, I think it brought us closer, you know, as a couple.  Yeah. Reignited the passion.  That's not-not what I meant  Oh, I'm gonna sneeze.  (sneezes)  Oh, my, God.  It's out! It's out!  - Oh! We win! We win! - (short laugh)  (munching) Candy, candy, candy.  Mm, I don't recognize you, tasty little candy baby.  Gene, no. No, no, no, no. No, honey, no!  - No! Gene! Give it! - No!  There's an oink, oink in the night   And it gives you such a fright   He's got a tail that's curly   And he's coming for you, girly   You got pig trouble   Pig trouble, little Tina   And you can try your best to shout   When you're smooching on that snout   But you kissed a fetal pig   And now you two are boyfriend-girlfriend   You got pig trouble   Pig trouble, little Tina."
"1  God, I love the mall. It's where the stores live. Aw.  Let's just make sure this is a quick trip  In and out, an hour, tops  Since we had to close the restaurant to come here.  Yeah, there are probably ones of people back there  banging on the door.  We know, Bob. We're just here to get you  nice new dress pants for Cousin Jerry's wedding.  Remember, don't let Jerry see them before the ceremony.  Everybody didn't actually have to come, you know.  Well, Tina's not gonna pass up a trip to the mall.  Um, yeah, I might just peel off and do some teen things.  You know, check out the mall dolls.  -Mall dolls? -Boys at the mall. Galleria guys.  -Fashion Center fish. Food court Casanovas. -I get it.  Tina's pube-dar has been pinging like crazy  ever since we got here.  She started scratching at the windows  when we were still in the parking lot.  Okay, I better get this over with.  I really don't enjoy pants shopping.  How do you think the pants feel?  Bob, it's fine. I'll be right there holding your hand.  And Gene and I will be right there,  pointing out problem body areas. Like there.  There.  - Ooh, there. - There.  What? That spot's fine.  - Eh - Oh, yeah, I see what you mean.  Forget it. I only want your mother.  You guys go do something else for a while.  - Here's not very much money. - I'll say.  Everybody meet by the fountain in an hour. Let's mall!  You are here.  We are, but how does it know?  Duh, Jocelyn. It connects to your phone or something.  Hey, Tammy. Jocelyn.  You guys here to check out mall dolls, too?  All right, I'm marking my territory.  I'll take the second level from the cell phone case kiosk  to Elvis Pretzel-y.  I mean, it's not that clever a pretzel store name.  Tina, you're not gonna steal our mall dolls.  You have zero mall game. We have  brand-new clothes we're going to return,  and we got made up for free at Lashora.  And I get my blood pressure checked for free  at the pharmacy. It wouldn't let go of me.  Well, I walked through three perfume sample sprayers.  By accident, but I think it works.  If you think you can do better than us  with the boys at the mall  go ahead and try.  Thanks. I will. Something  smells terrible.  Oh, it's me.  - Hi. - What?  Hang on, I'll catch up.  Aah! Shoelace!  - Hi. Sorry. - Hey!  Hi. Ooh, ow, tag.  Oh, my God, Q.R. Dunlop is here.  He's doing a reading and a book signing  of his new novel.  - Q.R. Dunlop? - The mystery author.  All his books are set in the world of fine wine.  Remember that one I was reading  Death Cabernet for Cutie?  Oh, right, that one book you read.  You carried it everywhere and made a big deal about it.  - I'm going in. - What? No. Lin,  you're helping me buy pants.  Bob, I can't miss this. It's a reading.  It's like a live book on tape.  But I need you to tell me what to get.  I'm gonna be standing there like an idiot.  Bob, look at me. You can do this by yourself.  They're called pants, not can'ts.  -But -Oh, I see him. His lips are moving.  He's started, I got to go!  Damn. Sinful buns by the Cinnabon.  I'm still dragging from soccer this morning.  Cool. Where there's soccer, there's shorts.  And why'd we go into that pet store?  My allergies are killing me now.  And he's sensitive. Killer combo.  I'm just gonna pop another antihistamine  and sit on this bench for a minute.  Self-care, so important. Right, Skye?  Noah and I will just go get smoothies.  Yeah, you do that, Skye and Noah. Get smoothies.  While I make a counter-clockwise approach.  Taking it slow. I'm just a girl at the mall  looking for a place to sit. How about here?  Casually looking over, and  Hi, I'm  Okay, maybe took it too slow.  So, Gene, how are we gonna spend our sweet folding money?  We can take it to the mattress store  and roll around on it like Demi Moore.  Hmm. How about those?  Um, what are you pointing at?  I can't see past the terrifying motorized animals.  - We'll take two. - Uh  Come on, saddle up. I'll take the dragon,  and you can have the, um Wow, I don't what that  - What is that? - It's a green cat.  Or maybe, uh, an alligator?  - Cat-igator? - Easy, cat-igator, easy.  All right, handlebars are by the ears.  To turn, just point their heads where you want them to go.  - Same way we turn Tina, got it. - This button here  is the throttle push it to go, let it go to stop.  Like my penis. Feeling better about this.  - Some rules - We love rules. Go.  No racing, no jousting, no Tokyo drifting,  -no bumping. -File those under not to do. Got it.  I think we're ready. Gene, give it some gas.  - Okay. - Push the button!  Oh. Aah!  Nothing. Guess I'll bail.  I'm losing mall daylight.  Oh.  I'm not gonna lie, this feels kind of nice.  Just a little human touch. Is that so wrong?  Hey, hey. Your boyfriend can't sleep here.  It's a mall. Not a math class.  Seriously. I'll squirt him with a water bottle.  - That's a mall cop Taser. - Oh, no,  he's just tired from sunrise soccer  and too many antihistamines and did you say boyfriend?  - I'm not - I get it he's the total package.  - Take it outside. - I don't actually even know him at all.  Okay, you win. He can snooze a little longer.  I wish I had a girlfriend who'd fight for me like you do.  - Thanks, but I mean, I'm - Wait, you're Brian's girlfriend?  You know, I thought maybe he'd met someone.  I can't believe he didn't tell us about you.  - Hi, I'm Noah. - I'm Skye.  I'm Tina, but wait, did  She was all, ""You better let my boyfriend sleep.""  -It was cute. -I can see why he likes you. Hugs!  - Actually, I, um - Coming in!  -Um, I -Mm! -Mm!  Wow, great hugs.  - But guys, you don't understand, I - Tina!  You have a boyfriend?  I, um  I  I mean, what does it frickin' look like, Tammy?  Uh, let me just check on my boyfriend here.  Shh. That's right, Brian. Just stay asleep.  Stay asleep.  Aren't you the guard at Family Fun Time?  I simply go where I'm needed.  And where they haven't tested me yet for drugs.  I can't believe Tina got a boyfriend.  With no mall game at all.  Hey, Tammy? Inside voice, 'Kay?  Brian really needs his sleep and you sound kind of like  a toy that needs new batteries. No offense.  - Let's just go, Jocelyn. - Yeah. Let's go hate shop.  So where did you guys meet?  Great question, Skye.  And the answer I have at my fingertips  is that we met here at the mall.  In the food court.  - At the, um, barbecue place. - But Brian's vegetarian.  I know! Uh, we-we were, um, there to protest.  We threw barbecue sauce on their fur coats.  - Why did they have fur coats? - Look, they just did, Skye.  Sorry, sorry. I-I just get so mad thinking about all that fur  - and barbecue. - You guys seem great together.  I'm really glad Brian met you.  And I can't wait to meet him in heaven.  You know, for the second time, after we're both dead?  Do you need any assistance today?  No. No, thanks, I'm, uh, I'm-I'm just looking.  At, um, pants. Uh, these are pants, right?  - Those are pants. - Yeah. I recognize them.  I-I usually pants shop with my wife, who's not here,  - so - I'm sure I can help.  Do you know your waist size?  Uh, I would say, uh 32?  Let's just get a measurement.  Thirty eight.  Uh, how about  - now? - 39.  How'd it get bigger?  All right, why don't we just with these?  - Those look huge. - Don't worry,  they're the same price as normal pants.  Let's open this up for you.  Underwear stays on. Are we clear on that?  I'll do my best. It's, uh,  - it's really old elastic. - Hmm  ""A sense of foreboding hung over the tasting room.""  Fun, right?  So frickin' suspenseful, I love it.  ""Master Sommelier Jack Rocker felt the heaviness  of the corkscrew in his pocket.""  Excuse me. Sorry.  ""Alice nervously oxygenated her Pinot  ""round and around,  when suddenly ""  - Huh. - Sorry. I'm sorry.  I get the hiccups in tense situations.  I'm so sorry. It's the last one, I can tell.  It's the last one.  ""The magnum of Riesling  exploded ""  I-I think the murder part's coming up.  That'll scare them out of me.  - Keep going, Q.R.. - Yeah.  - Sorry. Keep going. - Okay. ""Parker, the winery's  ""young social media manager, lay lifeless,  his head in the spit bucket.""  Parker, no.  - Hey, it worked. - Good.  ""The ma  I can't believe we got dusted  by that old lady on the Rascal.  That thing wasn't street legal.  And I don't mind losing, but the taunting was very hurtful.  Okay, we've raced, we've Tokyo drifted, we've bumped  Aah!  - Stay in your lane! - I guess we've done  all the things they told us not to,  so fun's over. Let's go back.  Huh. Uh, Louise, mine isn't stopping.  - What do you mean? - I'm on a runaway cat-igator!  Aah!  Oh, my God, this just got fun again.  And so, once I looked into Brian's big brown eyes,  - I just knew. - Brian's blue eyes?  Exactly. That's, uh, when I knew I was color-blind, Skye.  - Red, right? - Green.  No frickin' way. Just like Brian's hair.  - Right? - No.  Hi, Tina. Can't stop.  I just wanted to let you know that Jocelyn and I  have boyfriends now, too, so that's happening.  We met them at the arcade and they're totally 13.  - Yeah. Gonna be. - Anyway  Got to hit 12 first. The big one-two.  I said not to talk.  You know what, they don't even know how old they are.  'Cause all they do is play sports, and they're just  - super into sports. - Video game sports.  The ones rated ""E"" for everyone.  Anyway  we're gonna go pick up outfits for prom.  You said you'd help me find my mom.  Let's go!  How pathetic. Pretending to have boyfriends when you don't?  Hello? Sales guy? Uh, I'm not really sure about these.  I-I think I may hate myself in them?  Unless that's good?  Get over my thighs, son of a bitch!  Uh, are you all right in there?  - I'm fine. - Sergeant Bosco?  Oh. Hi, uh, Bob.  You're, uh, you're by yourself? You get divorced?  - No. No. I, I - Not yet, huh?  Hang on to her. Pants shopping by yourself  - is the worst. - Are those pleated all the way around?  - Uh, yeah. - Oh, that joker doesn't get our bodies.  - What do you think of these? - They're, uh, tight.  I went down a size. You don't like them?  I didn't say that.  I mean, where is it written a plainclothes cop  has to wear plain clothes, right?  - Hmm. - So these are a maybe.  Let's look at yours. Walk that way.  - Okay. - Walk back to me.  No, no, those pants are wearing you, Bob.  Yeah, that's, uh, what I'm feeling.  All right, here's what we're gonna do:  I'm gonna pick out a few things for you,  you pick out a few things for me.  - Okay. - Meet back here in five.  I want a splash of color in my batch.  - Surprise me. - You d-you don't have to surprise me.  I can't hear you.  Lean in, everyone. Get in there, Skye.  Great selfie, gang.  Or in Brian's case, a sleepie.  -Tina. -True. -What do you think?  Pop another antihistamine under Brian's tongue?  I just don't want him waking up, uh, with allergies.  No? Overkill?  You're the best girlfriend, Tina.  Oh. Somebody's texting Brian.  It's probably his mom checking on him.  Have you met her yet? She's gonna love you.  ""When can we kiss again? Amanda.""  His mom sounds great. Not her?  Uh, wrong number then, obviously.  Not for Brian.  ""I wrote your name on my binder, Brian.  - Now it's my Briander."" - Whoa.  I-I think we've got ourselves an old girlfriend, folks.  Stalker.  ""So glad you asked me to be  - your girlfriend yesterday."" - Spambot?  Tina, it sounds like this girl thinks she's Brian's girlfriend.  Which means you're  I know. I can explain. I didn't mean for this to happen.  Being two-timed!  - What? - Brian's cheating on you,  and that's not okay.  - We're Team Tina. - Um  - Go Team Tina. - Mm  Yes, Brian is obviously cheating on me.  Uh, I-I think the best thing is for me  to slip away quietly without saying goodbye.  And you guys not to even mention my name  because he doesn't deserve to hear it.  Tina, you can't let Brian treat you this way.  I don't know. This new girl sounds pretty incredible.  They've got that Briander thing now.  You have to wake him up and confront him.  Or a revenge affair? I kiss someone else?  You up for this, Noah? Any interest?  Shaking your head from side to side does that mean yes?  Tina, wake and confront.  I'm really more the tire slasher type.  -Did he ride his bike here? - Come on. - Tina.  Right, right.  And turn, hand in pocket, now step it out.  Do a leg kick.  Higher. Touch my hand.  I don't know.  I keep going back to the purple corduroy.  - Am I crazy? - Eh, maybe we both are.  What about these? I went down another size.  Kind of had to squeeze them over the ankle holster.  Uh, I think I can read the serial number on your gun.  But they look good, right? ""Stop, thief!""  ""I'm in pursuit on foot."" I don't know.  I don't know if this selection is cutting it.  I mean, there are other pants stores at the mall, right?  Yeah.  You know, I hear there's one where they serve you champagne.  Just checking on you gentlemen. I brought these.  They're chinos treated with stain guard.  I noticed the pants you came in with were somewhat stained.  - So what if they are? - Go to hell.  We're going to the champagne pants store.  I think you should wait for your wife to return.  Yeah? What do you think I've been doing  - for the last five years? - Let's do this.  I'm scared to death  but I am seeing some corners of the mall I don't usually get to!  That's a great-looking luggage store!  - Gene, just fall off. - Onto mall marble?  It's the hardest surface in the universe, Louise!  Ooh. The Grazielda Store.  I love their tchotchkes.  Gene, stay away from the Grazielda Store.  There's thousands of dollars of hideous  breakable porcelain in there.  Okay, but the cat-igator kind of has a mind of its own.  Scarf kiosk!  Ooh, silky.  Mmm. Satiny.  Ah, cashmere.  - Do it, Tina. - Okay, I'm waking him up.  Here I go. Brian.  - Guy's out cold, what can I say? - Tina! - NOAH: Come on.  - Brian. - Uh w-what?  Hope you're good and rested, boyfriend,  -'cause we're about to get into it. - Nice.  What's going on?  That's what Tina wants to know, Brian. What's going on?  - Wait, who's Tina? - Oh, so cold, man. - Ugh.  - You mean her? - Don't look at her  like you've never seen her before.  Yeah, like she's some kind of stranger to you all of a sudden?  Uh, s-she is. I  -Wow. -So I'm betting you never told Amanda  about Tina, huh?  No. I mean, why would I? I-I mean  So apparently, I mean nothing to you?  No. Yes? Ah, I'm so confused.  How do you think I feel? I almost kissed Noah.  - Not really. - Debatable.  Huh, true colors coming out, you piece of teen garbage?  - W-We're not a thing. - Unbelievable!  Say the word and I'll plant some sneakers on him  and take him in the back for shoplifting.  No, no. Maybe.  No, it's cool.  Hi, Q.R.  It's me, I'm Linda. I feel terrible.  Well, let's just sign your book and move you along.  Oh, it could've been worse.  One time I got diarrhea at a magic show.  So, uh, Linda with an I or a Y?  So, the killer. Is it the groundskeeper?  Um, w-why-why? What makes you say that?  Did I get it? Did I get it?  No. I mean, you-you couldn't have gotten it.  There-there are no clues in the first chapter.  Sure there are.  Like when his tractor backfires.  That's scary, murdery.  No, it startles the grape pickers.  It's to introduce Esmerelda and her connection to the land.  - Nah. - You can't say nah.  It's my book. I wrote it.  - Eh - Excuse me,  did you just say the groundskeeper did it?  Yeah, I got it in one chapter.  I guess I don't need this. Groundskeeper.  Oh.  I mean, it's just a guess.  Or, who knows? Maybe it was the cork salesman?  They actually did it together.  Crap, I am good at this.  Anyway, it's Linda with an I.  Pants, not can'ts   They're called pants, not can'ts     P-P-P-P-P-P-P-Pants.   This cat-igator isn't stopping, people.  Walk fast for your lives!  Poor bastard. I got to do something.  Hey, hi. Uh, just popping back to thank you for the long list  of things you told us not to do on the AniMalls.  You're very welcome. Not many kids thank me for that.  I mean, imagine if we had done that stuff.  Maybe the throttle button would have gotten, like, really stuck  and one of us would've ended up  just going around the mall forever.  Oh, yeah, I could definitely see that.  And then, uh, how would we even stop it,  in this fun alternate universe bad kids scenario?  Uh, I mean, you probably couldn't.  Ha ha. That would serve us right.  But really, how would we stop it?  Maybe you'd cut the battery cable?  Oh, that sounds really hard.  Yeah! The cable runs on the underside of the AniMall,  so it's anatomically correct.  You thought of everything.  And then there's a layer  of fake fur you'd have to get through  while the thing is moving. It's  Oh, h-holy crap, you're still talking.  I get it. It's super hard.  Ah, this was fun. I love hypotheticals.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  I don't know her.  Tina's the best damn thing that's ever happened to you,  and you're just throwing it away?  I don't think I can be friends with you anymore.  Stop. Stop.  - Brian's right. I-I don't know him. - What?  Everything just happened so fast, and I-I let you think  it was true, and then, maybe I started  letting myself think it was true.  Brian didn't do anything wrong. I did.  Oh, my God, Tina. You're protecting him.  Obviously. You are not worthy of Tina.  I'll need to see a receipt for those, playa.  Son of a bitch. Maybe it would just be simpler  for both of us if we got back together?  - Guys, listen - Tina, you're covering for Brian  because you're a great person.  - I mean, compliment accepted, Noah, but - Or what?  We're supposed to believe that you're a crazy stranger  who just plopped down on a bench next to a boy?  - That's what happened. - Nice try.  Yeah, Tina. You must be protecting me.  Nothing else makes sense.  - Damn it, Brian. You, too? - I don't know.  I had a lot of antihistamines.  It's like the Grazielda Store is pulling me in!  Excuse me, please keep that lizard-looking thing away  from my door. Thank you.  Gene, Gene. I'm here. I have a plan.  You mean climb onto yours?  I can't switch AniMalls midstream.  And by midstream, I mean pee-pee.  You can't, but I can.  Now hold onto me.  Shoo. Shoo now. Shoo. Sh-Sh-Sh-Shoo.  Gene, steer away from the Grazielda Store.  I can't hold you and steer!  I'm not even good at either one by itself.  I just need a few seconds.  The cable. Oh, damn food court knife.  Biodegradable crap!  No. No, no, no, no. Get away!  I'll sacrifice my body!  I'm so weak.  Ah !  Almost got it  Oh, God!  You did it, Louise.  You saved my sweet white ass!  And some sweet white porcelain.  Well, Gene, we rode 'em hard. Let's put 'em away wet.  Very wet.  How can I get through to you guys?  Tammy. Jocelyn.  Leave us alone, Tina. You win, okay?  You have a boyfriend. We are super impressed.  You are mall that.  I don't get it. Oh, ""mall.""  No, I don't even know this guy.  I-I made up the whole thing while he was asleep.  No one believes me. But you do, right?  Of course you did.  How did we not think of that right away?  I don't know.  Tina doesn't date like a normal person.  When I saw her with a boy I didn't recognize,  I should have assumed he was a robot or a hologram.  Yes. Thank you, Tammy. Now do you believe me?  - Man. - I guess. - Wow.  So that's all straightened out. What do you guys want to do now?  Food court? Brian, I heard your stomach rumbling  through the snores, buddy.  Uh, I'm gonna take off.  Go see Amanda.  Maybe we shouldn't go to the mall anymore.  But no matter what happens,  we should all meet back here in ten years.  But not Tina.  I'll come back in ten years just in case.  It will probably seem kind of funny then,  and who knows if Amanda will even be in the  Oh, you're really far away.  - Squirt. - Hey.  - You deserve it. - I know.  You know what, Tina? I take it back.  - You do have mall game. - Oh, thanks, Tammy.  I can't believe I kissed an 11-year-old.  - I can. - Hi, Tina.  - You have fun malling? - I don't know. Not really.  I guess maybe it's best to just let sleeping mall dolls lie.  'Cause otherwise it gets complicated real fast  and turns into a crap show.  Oh, okay, great. Let's talk later?  Hi, guys. Whatcha been up to?  I rode the dragon and saved Gene's life.  - It was terrifying. - Okay.  - Don't know what that means. - Hey.  So I bought pants.  Oh, my God. What happened?  I shopped by myself, Lin. Well, Sergeant Bosco helped.  - We drank champagne. - Quite a bit.  Are you guys wearing the same totally normal pants?  - Great minds - And not such great behinds.  Okay, I'm kind of thinking you weren't ready, Bob.  Huh. They do kind of look different in this light.  Yeah. I don't think these are the same pants  we tried on in the store.  There's so much gold thread. Was that always there?  Eh, I'm gonna go home, see if I can get 'em off.  Stay married, Bob.  So, how was the book reading?  Ooh, let's see what Q.R. Dunlop wrote in my book.  ""For Linda Belcher. Stay away from me.  I mean it."" Aw, he loves me.  Well, I guess we should head back to the restaurant.  - What for, to dust it? - You still need pants, Bob.  Let's return those and get you something  age and body-appropriate.  There were a couple of stores  Sergeant Bosco and I didn't make it to.  In and out. An hour, tops.  I could kill an hour. I might peel off again.  - Kids, here's some money. - Gene, another round?  Try the tiger and the panda this time?  That better be a restaurant in the food court.  Do you think purple corduroys are out of the question?  I don't know. Let me see them.  They're called pants, not can'ts   They're called pants, not can'ts   Ooh-ooh-ooh   P-P-P-P-P-P-P-Pants   P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-Pants, pants, pants, pants   Pants, pants, pants   They're called pants, not can'ts   Get yourself a new pair of pants   They're called pants, not can'ts   They're called pants, not can'ts   Ooh-ooh-ooh   P-P-P-P-P-P-P-Pants!"
"1  LOUISE: And we can put the screen over there.  Popcorn machine here.  Tina over there.  She'd go great with the condiments.  I think I actually look better by the windows.  Am I crazy?  And the signing booth I'm thinking right here.  Okay, let's not get carried away, Louise.  It's just a friend coming for lunch in two days.  A friend who stars as a kick-ass samurai  in our favorite movies  and a pirate in that one Verizon commercial,  and, sure, we're gonna do a private screening of one  of his movies, but we shouldn't let that make us crazy.  And I agree with you about the signing booth,  which will also be a VIP booth, and  we'll see who gets in.  It's fun having a movie star as a friend.  More fun than regular friends.  I mean, Kojima's more our friend mine and Louise's.  You guys jumped on the bandwagon  - kind of late in the game. - LINDA: Hmm.  Hey, everybody.  How's the screening party prep going?  Great. Don't worry, my dad  definitely has other clothes to wear.  Thanks again for hosting. The Hawk & Chick fan club  The Chicklets are really excited for the event.  And they're all fine with it not being  in an actual movie theater?  The Chicklets will be thrilled no matter where  they're watching this because I got my hands  on a super rare, one-of-a-kind, director's cut  of Hawk & Chick Versus Cephalopod Monster.  - Nice. - Mm, you've done good, Dominic.  - (both grunt) - You've done real good.  How'd you get a director's cut?  I was on the message boards and wing-bam-boom!  A collector guy said he'd loan us the print.  (growls) Love this guy.  This screening is gonna be the most important event  the world has ever seen.  (music playing)  You guys, stop, please.  Louise, it's the Nobel Prize people.  (laughing): D-Do they give Nobel Prizes  for having movie screenings?  Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Nobel?  I make all the other winners look stupid?  And you're giving me your biggest bell?  Move people, move!  This is a big friggin' day!  Time to blow some minds.  All right, listen up, people!  I hate to tear you away from all your sloppy Joes,  but you're gonna want to hear this.  Anything you have to say to me, you can say it  in front of my sloppy Joseph.  Everyone is hereby invited  to a screening of a Hawk & Chick movie  at my family's restaurant this Saturday.  You're welcome.  Oh, I almost forgot my visual aid.  Eh? VoilÃ .  Hawk & Chick. Is that, like, a bird sanctuary?  - (whispering): This is going great. - Is it?  And we would go to that because ?  Because, Tammy, first of all,  Hawk & Chick movies are amazing.  And secondly, Hawk, this guy? He's gonna be there.  Yeah, that's right, our friend  and star of the movie, Shinji Kojima,  is gonna be there, and he's our friend.  Wait, a celebrity's gonna be there?  Yeah, that's what I just said.  - Who? - Shinji Kojima.  Are you saying Shannen Doherty?  Are there bloopers?  I'm there if there're bloopers.  I like bloopers where they can't stop laughing.  - Those make me laugh. - (laughs) Me, too.  No. No bloopers.  Wow, that sounds amazing, Louise, count me in.  Oh, my God, that kid's arm looks like a burrito.  Um, it's a cast, Jocelyn.  He probably wants me to sign it.  It's like, ugh. Okay, fine, I'll sign it.  Uh, oh, okay, sure.  I want to sign it. I want to sign it.  - Ow. - What's your name?  Uh, uh, Rudy.  Ru Dy.  Oh. You signed my name.  Okay, then, back to screening party planning.  I just want to get a head count for popcorn, so  Poor Rudy, our wounded dove.  It's just, it's just not fair. Oh, God. (crying)  How'd it happen? How's the other guy look?  Uh, it was two hits:  My dad getting me a bunk bed  and me hitting the floor. Ugh.  Whoa, whoa! Let me do that. Down the hatch.  - Down the hatch. - (muffled): Thanks, Zeke.  Aw, how you doing, Rudy?  Oh, hey, Chloe.  Yeah, I'm doing okay.  I mean, I'm trying to ""get better""  like you wrote on my cast.  Okay, everyone, Rudy's gonna be fine. Geez.  Can we please just get back to the Hawk & Chick planning?  Gosh, Louise, all these older kids are so much more excited  about Rudy's cast and not what you're talking about.  We all care about Rudy, but arms break, okay?  Casts come and go.  And this is going away real soon.  Yup, coming off this Saturday.  I'll miss the head rubbing.  I really, really, really like the head rubbing.  I want in on that. Come on. Come on.  - Me, too. - Okay, no,  it's getting too close to a noogie, guys.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  - Hi, Dominic. - Hey.  Uh, so, listen, there's been a little wrinkle  - in the screening party plans. - Okay.  Well, uh, actually, it's more of a snag than a wrinkle.  Snags aren't bad, look at Dad. He has skin snags.  Uh, first of all, Tina, they're called skin tags.  And I have one.  - Hundred. - Anyway, Dominic, what's the problem?  Well, after I described the ""venue"" to my collector connect,  he got a little apprehensive about loaning us  the super rare director's cut  of Hawk & Chick Versus Cephalopod Monster.  Right. Sure.  So this guy won't let us borrow his film print  unless you put up a thousand dollar deposit as collateral.  - Oh, n-n-no. - Done.  - Not-not done. - (chuckles) What do you mean?  I-I mean, we don't have a thousand dollars to spare.  Yeah, right, that is very obvious,  but I'm saying you don't have to have a thousand bucks.  You're just letting this slightly uptight guy  He sounds a little uptight  - He's fussy. - Hold the check temporarily,  and then when we return the print,  he rips up the check. Am I missing something?  Sorry, Louise, we can't take that risk. The screening is off.  Wait, a lot of people from school are coming.  If we don't have the screening, we don't get to show Koji off  uh, I mean, we don't get to see Koji?  Well, we can probably still see him.  He's here to see Yuki's baby, and I think he really wanted  to stop by the restaurant when we  - begged him to stop by the restaurant. - Yeah.  Great. I guess we won't do the one thing  - I've ever cared about. - Thattagirl.  (grumbling): Stupid collector  and his stupid deposit.  Glow-in-the-dark cast? Damn.  They could lower you down a well to find lost kids.  I want to see.  Oh, my God, it's so bright.  That's it, I'm gonna break my arm after school.  - Do it. - I'm going to.  Oh, hey, Louise. Everyone's really looking forward  to your screening party tomorrow.  Great. Well, about that  Yeah, it's the same day I'm getting this sucker off.  Hey, we should celebrate. Throw you a party.  - Yeah, a Cast Away party. - Cast Away party.  I said it first. And I want to go.  - I said Cast Awa - Cast Away party.  - I said that. - She said it first.  - I said it. - Well, tomorrow's no good.  It's Louise's Hawk & Chick screening party.  Actually we have a bit of an announcement.  Tina, wait, shh. No, we don't.  Um, yes, we do. The Hawk & Chick screening party  - is actually canc - Totally still on.  Maybe we can do Rudy's Cast Away party at your screening party.  Great idea, yeah.  I mean, there's probably not time to do both,  and one is so clearly more important  than the other. Sorry, Rudes.  It's okay. I don't need a party.  I've had more attention with this  than when my backpack caught on fire at Olive Garden.  - But the screening is - Is completely on.  See you there.  But how? Dad won't put down the thousand smackeroos.  Ooh, that would be a good breakfast cereal.  Yeah, maybe he won't, but we will.  DOMINIC: I thought your dad said  he couldn't afford the deposit.  No. Our parents are loaded.  They're just embarrassed about how rich they are. In fact,  you got to promise not to bring this check up to them.  - At all. - Yeah. We don't even know  that they keep the checkbook in the drawer by the cash register.  So wh-why would that come up?  Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.  And our dad is just learning cursive,  so his signature is not very good.  All right. Cool to learn how the one percent lives.  One percent is what I call my wiener.  LOUISE: And so Dominic put up the thousand bucks himself.  But he made me promise that you guys  wouldn't bring it up to him.  - Why not? - 'Cause he used the money  his grandma left him when she died,  and if you mention it, he'll cry.  Aw, that's so sweet.  And he's a real sloppy crier, so let's leave it be.  And all of that is true.  Ha. Ha. Ha.  Sister, brother, my office?  Stop acting weird.  But it feels weird to go behind Mom and Dad's back.  Not if you sneak up behind their back  and give 'em a little massage.  Listen, the screening party is gonna be a hit,  then we'll return the movie to the collector  and he'll throw away the collateral check.  Forged collateral check.  Yes, that one.  And Mom and Dad will never know  that they almost ruined the most amazing thing  that we've ever done in this place. Meeting adjourned.  Dominic, how are we doing over there?  First reel's loaded and number two's waiting till intermission.  I've also got a number two waiting for intermission.  Everyone getting excited, feeling good?  Hot damn, I'm excited!  I haven't met anybody famous  since the clown at my seventh birthday party.  He wasn't famous then,  - but later he killed somebody. - Whoa.  Like, when is this celebrity guy even getting here?  I'm tired of holding this selfie stick up.  That's what that is?  I thought you were going, like, skiing or something.  When's Shrek getting here?  - It's not Shrek, Andy. - Spock?  - It's not Spock. - Shrek?  - No. - Star Shrek?  Wait, is this a Star Shrek movie?  No. There's no such thing.  Uh, hey, Louise, I know you're kind of busy,  but maybe later you can find some time  to sign you-know-what.  I don't know how much longer I'll be able  to save this spot for you.  And it's coming off later today,  so, you know, last chance.  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe after the movie  - or, um, after the Q and A. - (door opens, bell jingles)  Hey! There he is!  Here I am. (chuckles)  Ah, good to see you, Bob.  Get in here. (grunts)  Oh, that, uh, that that feels good.  Ah, you feel like a marshmallow wearing a T-shirt.  - Thank you? - Ah  You changed your shampoo.  I I-I did.  - KOJIMA: Smell very nice. - Bob, stop hogging him.  Come over here, you.  How's Yuki's little baby?  Unbelievable, the sweet cuteness.  It's a total cuddle party.  Pictures? You got pictures?  - Later. Later, Linda. - Aw, you torture me.  - It's nice to see you, Dominic. - You, too, Koji.  And look around,  the Hawk & Chick fan club is here.  Aha! Hello, Chicklets.  - (fans clamoring) - Hi, I'm Teddy.  I'm sure these guys told you all about me.  I, uh, looked at Japan the other day  on a globe pretty small.  Uh yes.  You know what, let's get you to the VIP lounge  for the remainder of the evening, shall we?  Excuse us, excuse us.  Kojima, meet my good friend Rudy.  Hello, Rudy. Ah, I see you've been injured.  Yup. Night of sleep gone wrong.  You know, I once broke my arm during a mime class  - in drama school. - Oh.  I remained perfectly silent.  Stuck inside that damn box.  That's badass.  Ah, bup-bup-bup you can talk later.  Right now we're gonna start the movie.  Dominic, show us what you got!  Hawk & Chick Versus Cephalopod Monster.  Cephalopod Monster?  This is the movie we're screening?  Uh-huh. And it gets even better.  We got the only print  of the never-before-seen-in- a-movie-theater version:  the director's cut!  - Director's cut? - Yep.  It's got stuff that was cut out  of the original theatrical release.  Isn't that great? My man.  G-Great. Y-Yes. Uh, uh  Dominic, let's do it, huh?  Lights!  (film projector whirring)    (woman screaming in movie)  Hey, K-Koji, where you going?  Excuse me while I-I take a huge pee.  (grunting)  Uh, Koji, what's going on? Buddy?  No one can ever see this!  -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! -No! (grunts)  Dominic, did he steal half the movie?  - Yeah. He took the second reel. - What the ?  - Oh, no, your deposit. - Oh, no, your deposit.  - Wait, what? - Wait, what?  My deposit? Your deposit.  Your dead grandma's money?  Huh? My grandma isn't dead.  She lives an active life in Tucson  with my step-grandpapa.  Why are we talking about her?  - 'Cause you put down the collateral. - I didn't. You did.  Louise gave me a check. She said you guys were rich.  Oh, God. Louise, what's going on?  Did you forge my name on one of our checks?  No. I mean, a little.  So we wouldn't have to cancel the screening party.  You get-you get it, right?  Louise!  Koji, Koji, Koji, Koji.  He's not out there.  What the heck is going on?  Why would he steal his own movie?  I don't know. What do we do now?  Well, since there's still an audience,  I could try out my not-so-tight five.  Hey, I'm seeing a lot of people here on dates.  You two, how'd you meet A striped shirt convention?  You just got Gene'd! Thanks, that's my time.  BOB: (sighs) Voice mail again.  Hey, uh, hey, Koji. It's Bob, uh, again.  Just needing you to bring that film print back.  We just need to get the deposit from the collector,  the guy that Louise had no permission to give  a thousand dollars to. This is Bob,  uh, Belcher from the whole thing earlier  when you ran off with the priceless movie.  Okay, please call me. Please call me. Call me.  That's your best one yet.  If he doesn't call back, he's a fool.  We're very disappointed in you, miss Missy.  You were getting all show-offy with your movie pal,  and you didn't think about how you were putting the restaurant  in danger with that forged check.  You should only forge for nuts. And berries.  Uh, that's different, Lin.  - You're thinking of ""forage."" - What did I say?  - I-It's fine. - Forge.  I'm sorry, but it's Hawk & Chick.  I had to do it. Deep down, you wanted me to do it.  No, I didn't.  Look, Dominic is gonna talk to the collector  and buy us some time.  We just got to track down Koji,  get the movie back, and we're good.  I mean, maybe try Yuki again?  No answer. Mailbox is full. Probably from me.  - (phone vibrates) - Oh, wait, wait. She's texting.  ""Got your messages. My dad's not here.  ""I haven't seen him all day.  Thank you for your concern.""  Thank you for your concern?  -Where could he have gone? -Huh. There's something on that reel  that he didn't want anyone to see.  Wait, we have Hawk & Chick Versus Cephalopod Monster  - on VHS. - So?  So maybe if we watched it we can figure out  why he wanted it so bad and maybe know  how to get him to bring it back?  I guess it's worth a shot.  Ooh, let's make nachos.  Nachos, nachos, nachos.   All right, well, this is the second half of the movie,  so I guess look for anything weird?  (Gene grunting)    - BOB: Wait, what the - GENE: Did I just wake up  - from a really quick coma? - Oh, phew.  It wasn't just me? I had a longer-than-normal blink.  Looks like a bad edit. Maybe the editor  got a little slice-happy, like I do with my toenails.  Still hurts to walk on this foot.  We've seen this one a bunch of times.  How have we never noticed that? Or maybe we did  but just assumed it was our crappy VCR?  So the director's cut has that missing scene,  and that missing scene is what Koji didn't want us to see.  I bet it's something scary, like it's haunted.  A haunted scene?  - (TV turns off) - Yeah, like maybe there was  a real-life death on set.  - Happens all the time. - Maybe some extra was killed,  and then her ghost haunted the set.  The camera filmed the ghost,  but they didn't realize it till way later,  and they had to cut it out of the movie, or else  audiences everywhere would've been haunted.  - Boo! - (screams) Oh, my God.  That's probably exactly what happened.  Or the more likely version  is Koji was out at the discos every night.  It was the height of his celebrity in Tokyo,  and it was the '70s.  Big hair. Bigger disco ball.  Drinks were on him. Sushis all around.  He ran up a massive disco bill  that he couldn't afford to pay.  So he had to do the club owner a favor  and get his nephew a part in a movie.  And he was terrible. He could never find his mark,  forgot all his lines, and, worst of all,  he sneezed on the craft services table,  destroying all the takoyaki.  Geez, that's a pretty good theory there, Gene.  Maybe the missing scene was a love scene.  Not a hard ""R."" Maybe right on the line?  What if the woman inside the Cephalopod Monster suit  was Koji's one true love? It started small.  Chitchat in hair and makeup,  knock-knock jokes, and their love grew.  And when it came time to kill the monster,  Koji dropped his sword and had a passionate kiss.  With tongue. The studio had to cut the scene,  and now Koji can't bear to be reminded of his one true love.  - That's so sad. - (sighs) Okay.  This has not at all been helpful in finding Kojima.  Oh, no, the-the screening went great.  Yeah, we-we should have your super rare print back  later today. And why-why wouldn't we?  (chuckles) What? I sound nervous? No.  I always sound this way. (chuckles)  Do you want to talk to Bob? He can reassure you.  -Here you go. -Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't want to talk  Uh, hi, hey. Hi. Hi there.  This is Bob, the guy who, um, who totally has your movie.  No, I-I didn't think he sounded nervous, n-no.  (chuckles): Now, wait. Wait, I-I I sound nervous?  No, no, no, we-we just both have, um  Oh, my God, we have bees on us.  Uh, I better hang up and deal with these bees.  - Oh, God! Bees! - (phone rings)  Nice.  Bob's Burgers.  Yuki?  (gasps) He's at your house?  Louise is there, too?  Wait, Louise is there? When did she leave?  -A while ago. -Lin, can I talk to her? Can I talk to her?  How's the baby? How you sleeping?  Never mind. Tell her we're coming over.  Oh, is he gassy?  Aw, little baby gas. Little tiny toots.  - Lin, see you in the car. - Ooh, the baby.  - Koji. - Stay back!  Take another step, and I'll slice this movie into bits.  - (baby coos) - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy.  BOB: Oh, my God. What's going on?  Stay back. I just need to cut one scene.  Don't try anything,  or I will cut up the whole movie.  E-Easy, Kojima.  You don't want to do that. I-It's a one-of-a-kind print,  and I will lose a lot of money if anything happens to it.  - How did you find me? - I called them.  - No. Yuki, no. - Yes, Dad, yes.  Did you hide my phone when I was napping?  Uh, the baby did?  Well, I found it and listened  to Bob's 15 crazy, ranting messages.  Well, five ranting. I think ten were reasonable.  Louise, how'd you know he was here?  I didn't, but I figured it had to be Koji texting  from Yuki's phone. It sounded too formal.  It was like when I text from Mom's phone  - to explain why I missed school. - Wait, what?  - How'd you get here? - I took the bus.  Why didn't you tell us where you were going?  'Cause I didn't know if I was right,  but I I-I just wanted to fix it.  Dad, what is happening?  Let me make this edit.  I just found the scene.  What can be so bad that you don't want us  - to see? - I I cannot say.  Is it maybe because the scene  - is haunted? - What? No.  Right, because that scene is actually a passionate kiss  between you and your one true love,  the woman inside the squid monster thingy.  Who? Haruto?  He's a nice guy, but he's not my type.  Perhaps running up a big ol' disco bill  - had something to do with it? - Eh? No.  (whispers): Let's distract him and grab the movie.  Hey, Mom, I bet you'd love to hold that baby.  (gasps) Please, can I hold the baby?  - Sure. - Oh, give me the baby!  Oy! Oy! (groans)  Dad, hand-off, hand-off.  But-but please.  I don't want the world to know.  Kojima, I'm sorry, but whatever's on this thing,  - it-it can't be that bad. - Oh, it can't?  Kojima, please, just tell us.  This is all my fault. I just  I love Hawk & Chick so much,  and I was just trying to get everyone else to like it.  I don't know, I wanted to be a big shot and show off  and do the screening, and if it weren't for me,  you wouldn't be freaking out right now, and  (sighs) Just tell us so we can help.  (groans) All right.  Have you ever heard of Itsuki Sugimoto?  - ALL: No. - Exactly.  No one has heard of him, and this is because of me.  I-I don't understand.  Come. I will show you.  -(projector whirring) -KOJIMA: That is Itsuki Sugimoto.  This no-name actor comes in.  He had one scene.  One scene. But the camera loved him.  - He blew me off the screen. - LINDA: Oh, yeah.  - He's amazing. - He's, like, all I can look at.  Yeah, there's your movie.  Stop cutting to Hawk.  - I mean, sorry. - No, you're right.  I look like a guy  pretending to be a samurai,  but he is putting on an acting clinic  in the middle of my movie.  When we finished filming, all anyone could talk about  was Itsuki this, Itsuki that, Itsuki  (frustrated mumbling)  So I used my influence to get him cut out of the film.  BOB: So what happened to him?  KOJIMA: He does local theater.  Teaches acting.  He spends a lot of time with his grandchildren.  Uh, I stalk him online.  And you've never apologized to him?  He doesn't even know it was me.  He thinks it was the studio who cut him from the movie.  Maybe you should call him and say you're sorry.  What time is it in Japan right now?  4:00? 4:30? Dinnertime? Maybe 6:00? 6:35?  I mean, you could also try and get this version released.  -(phone vibrates) -I don't have much pull these days,  but I could try.  Maybe get him some swag.  Hawk & Chick beer Koozie?  Oh, guys, that's the collector. Uh,  we should probably get this back to him.  Yes. Please. Now. Because of the money.  See? Told you this would work itself out, huh?  Oh, don't think you're not in trouble, little lady.  - I know, I know. - And we're putting  an alarm system on that checkbook.  If you get within five feet of it, it'll go,  ""No, Louise. No, Louise."" (imitating alarm blaring)  - Hey, Rudy. - Oh, hey.  How's your arm? It looks really pale.  Yeah. And my muscles atrophied a bit.  Well, that-that's been happening.  Listen, I'm sorry that I didn't want the screening  to also be your Cast Away party.  I should've shared the spotlight with you.  No, that-that's okay.  I'm sure it'll break again soon.  We're not returning the bunk bed,  and my dad just got me a trampoline.  I never even signed your cast.  Well, it's not too late.  The spot I saved you is still there.  Aw, that's nice.  Whoa! That thing stinks.  - (coughs) - Oh, yeah. That's seven weeks  of unwashed Rudy arm.  (sniffs) I kinda like it.  Hey, you know what? How about we have  your Cast Away party after school today?  - Really? - Yeah.  What if I take you out for a frozen yogurt?  Oh, is that a party?  - (grunts) - Ow! Ow! I'm kidding. I-I'm kidding.  - Can I get toppings? - You tell me. You're paying.  ANNOUNCER: Hastings Classics proudly presents  the director's cut of Hawk & Chick  Versus Cephalopod Monster: The Final Slice.  This never-before-seen version features  your favorite father-daughter traveling barber/samurais  as they battle the giant Cephalopod Monster  and its destructive tentacles.  This digitally remastered re-release  includes restored scenes featuring  the debut of Itsuki Sugimoto.  Order today.

"1  You just ate two burgers really fast   And it wasn't weird or gross at all to watch, yeah!   What song is that? I like it.  All right, Becket and Maya should be here any minute.  Aw, I can't wait.  I don't want their burgers to get cold.  Ooh, I'll just hold them close to my body to keep them warm.  - Wait. Who's coming in? - Becket and Maya.  - Oh, that artsy-smartsy couple? - Yeah. God, I love them.  So, they came in here, met you guys, ate your food,  and now they just keep coming back again and again and again?  Who does that? It's creepy.  - Um, well, I mean - Right?  So, what, are you guys restaurant friends  or, like, friend-friends?  It seems like they want to be friend-friends.  Ah, that's good. That's great. Wow. Ah!  Oh, they just parked. How does my hair look?  - It's fine. Wait, hold on. - What?!  Never mind. It's fine. It's fine. It-It's too late.  Come out of the rain, you two.  - Bob and Linda! - Hey, guys.  Uh, sorry about my hair. How-how are you?  - We're good. - Yeah.  We were craving fried clams, so we decided  to drive up the coast to this great little place on the water.  It doesn't even have chairs.  Oh, I love your lives.  Driving around, looking for clams, not sitting on chairs.  Unfortunately, it was closed.  -Aw. -I know, right? But on the way back,  we came across a glass blowery,  and the guy taught us how to blow glass.  So now we know how to blow glass.  Um, well, it's not fried clams, but here's your order.  Hey, Maya had an urge for fried clams.  I will always just have an urge for your burgs.  - See? Creepy. - We both love your burgers.  We love you guys so much! I mean, what?  Hey, what are you guys doing tonight?  - They're busy. - Teddy.  We were gonna watch The Earl Grey Murders.  It's a British detective show.  so it's like reading a book.  Well, if you're feeling spontaneous  and want to brave the weather,  we're having a little thing at our place tonight.  Aw. What kind of little thing?  Well, we live in the old Hubcap Building.  You-you know, the artist lofts?  Artist lofts.  Yeah, people sort of take turns hosting.  We're doing it tonight.  People drink, hang out, eat some food, play some music.  - That sounds awful. - Teddy.  Things get going around 10:00 or 10:30 or so.  Wait. At night? What are you, the Lost Boys?  - Look, no pressure. - No pressure.  We get it. You guys have kids.  - At least three of 'em. - Uh, we might have had too many.  Here's the address. If we see you, we see you.  Have a nice night.  - (door opens, bells jingle) - We will, Maya.  TINA: Mom, Dad, we want to show you the game we made up.  Uh-huh.  Stop what you're doing and look at your sweet-ass children!  You kids are so wound up. I'm trying to watch the weather.  It's cold! It's rainy!  Oh, look again! It's gonna be cold  and rainy some more, like it's been all week!  Okay, calm down. Calm down, sweetie.  You kids are just a little stir crazy today.  It's time for you to brush your teeth and get ready for bed.  Wait. We didn't show you our game.  - It's called Throw Louise. - Mm-mm.  All right, now get into position.  - I'll be the basket. (groans) - Kids.  - Grab my heinie at least! - Kids.  Don't really throw your sister, Tina.  The game's called Throw Louise, Mom.  - Kids. - And here we go.  - Aah! Oh. - No!  - Oh, my God! - You spilled my TV-watching wine!  That was the end of our last bottle! God!  Kids, go get ready for bed!  I'm pretty much ready.  I'm already dripping in eczema cream.  I think I could squeeze half a glass out of this.  - Don't, though, right? - Right.  I'm just gonna suck on the rag once real quick.  Oh. Oh, God, that rag's disgusting.  I love you.  Well, should we put on The Earl Grey Murders?  Yeah.  INSPECTOR COLLINS (on TV): Oh, hello, Herbert.  I see you're back from the country.  HERBERT: I am. We were planning on staying until Sunday,  but then it was already Saturday, and it felt too long.  - And then - The murder?  HERBERT: Exactly, so that's why we came back today.  -(Linda grunts) -What's going on? Do you have to pee?  - No. - Poo?  Yes, but that's not why I paused it.  I just realized this show is so frickin' boring  when I don't have wine.  So, should we watch something else?  Wha-What do you want to do?  Maybe we should do something actually fun?  - Sleep? - No, Bob, listen.  This is gonna sound a little crazy,  but I think we should go out.  Out of the room?  No, out out. Out of the house.  Let's go to Maya and Becket's party.  Tonight? You want to leave now?  Look, Becket and Maya said if we were feeling spontaneous,  we should go to their party.  Well, I'm feeling spontaneous. We can try and get a sitter.  You want to get a sitter and go to a party that starts at 10:00?  Yeah. We can call Jen.  Well, Jen will probably say no  'cause it's so last-minute, but okay.  I'm calling her. Hey, Jen, it's Linda.  I know. Phones say names now.  So this is super last-minute,  but could you possibly babysit tonight?  Hmm. I guess I could put some things on hold.  All right! Come on over!  I can't believe it!  - We're going out. - Okay, so, uh, we're doing this?  I'll, uh, I'll-I'll tell my body  to stay awake a little longer, and it just will.  LOUISE: So one minute we're going to bed,  and the next minute you're leaving the house?  You know it's dark outside, right?  Are you guys in the Mafia?  We're going to a building party  at our new friends' building.  Yeah, you're in the Mafia.  And I understand that Jen is coming over to watch us?  Yes, she is.  Oh, cool. Cool. Cool.  Just curious, not upset, but why am I not babysitting?  'Cause it's late, Miss Missy.  You got to go to sleep. You can't sleep and sit.  - Hello. - (all scream)  Oh, my God, Jen, you scared us!  Sorry. The door was unlocked?  Uh, no, it wasn't.  After I unlocked it, it was.  I guess I still have a key.  Oh, we're in good hands.  You guys get out of here. Have fun.  Sorry it took me longer than I expected to get over here.  My hot cousin was worried about the weather,  so he let me borrow his truck,  and he had to show me how to drive it.  Your hot cousin?  Yeah, tell us about that.  I have a lot of cousins. He's the hot one.  Well, glad you're here. We're gonna head out.  All right, kids, the second that door shuts,  I want you to go straight to bed.  Jen, we should be home around midnight?  Oh, my God, that's so late.  (exhales) We're doing this.  All right, let's go! Got to stay awake!  And do I come with you guys, or I stay here?  Here, Jen, you stay here.  I'm gonna stay with you guys.  Kids, go to bed! And stay out of my room!  We're going to a loft party, we're going to a loft party!   Loft party, here we go, Bob, loft party   Living out our dreams, loft party, yeah.   Ugh. I forgot to poop before we left.  Ooh, gas station. Pull over.  Okay, sure.  (whoops) Gas station poop.  - Gas station poop. Come on, Bob. - Uh  Time for bed, children. Good night.  Great call, Jen. Damn it, she's crushing this.  Whoa. There's an ice cream truck parked right outside.  Oh, the lord of sweets has answered my prayers tonight!  Okay, Tina, let's pool your money and head down there.  Who do I pool my money with?  Um, I'm sorry to break your bubbles,  but that ice cream truck isn't in service at the moment.  - How do you know that? - 'Cause I drove it here.  - Your cousin's truck is an ice cream truck? - Yes.  Why are we talking when we could be eating ice cream?  There's no ice cream in the truck.  Uh, nice try, but why would there not be ice cream  in an ice cream truck, Jen? We're not idiots.  - Let's get her! - Aah!  Please don't get me.  There's no ice cream in the truck 'cause it's winter.  Aah! I believe her.  But it's still an ice cream truck.  I mean, shouldn't we go inside of it?  When are we gonna get this chance?  - Tina, I love it. - Yeah. I'm not in charge.  I'm just a kid, damn it. Let's let loose!  And maybe there's some sprinkles on the floor.  I'm not above floor sprinkles.  So, Jen, look, in order to get us to sleep,  we're gonna need to go in the truck.  - Okay. That makes sense. - Oh. Great.  All right. I feel so alive! I'm young again!  Okay, we're here.  Should we maybe call Jen real quick and check on the kids?  They're sleeping. I'm sure they're fine.  Well, Gene's been falling out of bed a lot lately,  but he's soft, so he'll probably be okay.  (music playing)  What?! No way!  Bob and Linda came to our party!  We did it! We brought snacks.  Sorry, they're from the gas station.  Gas station snacks. Love it.  Long story. I clogged a gas station toilet.  Not a long story. Ooh, is that crab dip?  Drinks?  - Yes, please. - Yup, yup, yes, now. Now!  Mmm. Oh. (coughs)  That's good. That's-that's, that's strong.  Mmm. Oh. Wow.  This drink has herbs in it.  It's like a little alcoholic salad in there.  I think I'm already drunk.  Look at us, Bob. We're at a grown-up party.  I'm glad we were so spontane  Ugh. Oh, my God, so many leaves.  LOUISE: Hmm. Guess there really wasn't  any ice cream in here.  Well, I had that one sprinkle.  I'm pretty sure it was a sprinkle.  I don't think it was a sprinkle.  Should we go back inside for sleeping?  Easy, Jen. Not yet. What else is in here?  Besides no ice cream.  Yeah. We got to at least hear some tunes.  Which one of these turns on the ice cream truck jam?  The truck plays four songs.  You turn this dial to pick which one.  - Do it, Jen, make it happen. - Uh, okay.  (upbeat, instrumental tune playing)  GENE: Damn! That's funky.  There's also a ""mick-rophone.""  Would that be of any interest to you?  Oh, um, perhaps.  (over speaker): Hey! Lady in the raincoat,  is this thing on?  Wet enough for you? (sighs)  We have so much power. So much power.  Now we just have to figure out what to do with it.  (over speaker): Fart! Fart! Fart! Fart! Fart!  Not bad, Gene. Not bad at all.  Well, Jen, you want to take a spin around the block?  We should, uh, probably go back upstairs?  Jen, Jen, Jen, we're not gonna get tired  unless you drive us around. The movement lulls us.  Is this your first time babysitting? Is it? Huh?  - Um - Huh?  I mean, I don't think so, but, um  -That's what I thought. Let's drive. -Yeah!  LOUISE (over speaker): Hey, you! Yeah, you!  Yeah! Do you want some ice cream?  Too bad. We don't have any!  Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive!  So, you make sculptures, and you're a physicist?  I'm also a doula.  Aw, babies. And what, and what do you do?  - I make ukuleles. - Huh.  Biodegradable ukuleles.  - Huh. - Also edible.  Ah, that's so smart.  You really made this whiskey?  - You make whiskey? - Yeah.  Small batch. Just a few thousand cases.  So you have one of those things with the curly copper pipes,  and then whiskey comes out of it?  Yes. It's in the building at the end of the block.  Oh, you have the coolest job and life.  And you're thin and young.  - How old are you? - 49.  - I hate you. - You know, uh, Bob,  I have to tell you something about the whiskey.  It's very strong.  Yeah, I-I-I've had a lot of them.  (chuckles)  Oh, my God, everyone here is so interesting.  I know. I met a guy who owns an urban ranch.  I guess the cows live inside old office buildings.  We're so boring.  (sighs) Yeah, we're really boring.  Should we maybe go home?  We're the coolest ones there, right?  In the top five anyway.  - Who needs another drink? - Not for me. I'm driving.  Is what I was gonna say two drinks ago.  We're probably gonna take a taxi.  Should we take a drink in the taxi?  No, we're fine, we're fine. Right? We're fine.  Speaking of, we're probably gonna head out.  Whoa, whoa, you can't leave before the performance circle.  You know, I have a feeling it's gonna be really good tonight.  Performance circle?  Uh, who's performing?  Oh, everybody performs.  It's the best part of the party.  I mean, not everybody performs, right?  Did we not tell you about the performance circle?  No.  We probably should've told you about the performance circle.  You don't have to perform, but no one's ever not performed.  It's fun. Everyone's so talented.  Oh, uh, not-not-not us.  We're-we're not those kind of people.  We're more, um, go-to-bed people.  Oh, we're gonna perform something!  - Don't you worry. - Oh, boy.  - (chuckles) Great! - Lin  A lot of people don't know this,  but Bob can sing like Bobby  - McFerrin. - (high-pitched): Linda, please stop.  And I sing like  - Linda Ronstadt. - Mm.  And we call ourselves Linda and Bobby.  But we don't mean them We mean us.  - Lin - All right, let's circle up, everybody!  It's performance time!  - Song one. Song two. - (songs alternating)  Song one. Song two.  I am the voice of the night!  All who hear me, do my bidding!  (groans) Where is everyone?  It's like a ghost town out here.  JEN: Hang on. Red light.  Everybody stabilize.  LOUISE: Uh, what's happening?  - We're skidding. - What?!  Oh, sorry. We're skidding!  (all screaming)  - (grunting) - Okay, that's it!  I'm putting back on my responsible teen hat.  The roads are freakin' freezing over!  We're going home and we're going to bed.  Jen, I think my sister might be onto something.  I mean, we warned you not to take us for a spin,  but, God, you insisted.  - Did I? - Yes.  What was I thinking?  All right, let's go back to your place.  (engine revving)  So, just, uh, start driving and get us home, Jen.  JEN (nervously): Mm, mm  No, no, no. We're not going anywhere, Jen!  This is on you! I mean, we're all gonna get  in so much trouble, but this is on you!  There's also freezing to death.  Seems like that could happen, too.  Aah! Freezing to death is worse than getting in trouble!  GENE: Tell that to Encino Man!  Great documentary. Highly recommend.  (quietly): Why did you tell them I can sing like Bobby McFerrin?  'Cause I don't want to be the boring people who don't perform.  We can do it. We can keep up with these guys.  And who knows? Sometimes people are amazing  the first time they try something.  So maybe you can sing like Bobby McFerrin.  You don't know. Try it, try it.  Oh, my God.  (deep-voiced vocalizing)  (falsetto vocalizing)  (deep-voiced vocalizing)  (falsetto vocalizing)  No, no. Not like that. That's weird.  Wait, are you sure? I think it sort of sounded good.  We got to figure something out.  - I have an idea. Let's leave. - Now?  - Yes. - We can't leave.  No, no, no, no. We can.  Come on. Take my hand.  Keep going, keep going.  We're almost at the door.  I'm going, I'm going.  - What about our coats? - Oh, crap.  We'll leave 'em, we'll leave 'em.  No, we can't leave our coats.  That's my favorite coat.  BECKET: Bob and Linda, get ready!  It's almost your turn!  Yep, yep. Great!  We were just looking for a better place to stand.  Here. Here is good. We'll stand here, right?  This is good. (chuckles nervously)  (quietly): We were so close.  (Tina and Gene shivering)  Is the heater turned all the way up, Jen?  'Cause I can both smell and see Tina's breath.  Fun fact: ice cream trucks don't have heaters.  That is a fun fact.  Are we having fun now?  Look, it's 11:30,  and Mom and Dad said they'd be home around midnight.  We're too far away to walk,  and we'd freeze to death before we got there anyway.  So I guess we just have to see if the roads get better  and try to beat them home somehow.  God, it's cold in here.  Tina, Gene, body heat.  - Let's snuggle. - Yep.  Sibling sandwich.  And Jen makes five.  - Sorry. - For what?  Oh, Gene.  That heater's working.  (playing ""Flight of the Bumblebee"")  Oh boy.  - (applause) - ""Flight of The Bumblebee""?  More like ""Flight of the Humble-bee.""  You never mentioned you played the accordion.  -(chuckles) -(chuckles) Okay, Kathy, you're up next.  (quietly): Oh, God, it's almost our turn.  - Everybody's so good at stuff. - (applause)  So, for my performance, I'm going to be painting a portrait  of Becket and Maya.  That's not so great.  - In one breath. - Damn it.  Maya, Becket, pick a comfortable pose.  (inhales deeply)  Who are these people?  All right, it's possible it's gotten worse out there.  There's ice on the windows now.  I hate to say it, but I think we have to call  and tell Mom and Dad what's going on.  Want to take this one, Jen?  Okay. Uh Oh, it went to voice mail.  Um, hi, Mr. and Mrs. B.  Jen calling.  We're in an ice cream truck on the side of the road,  and we're stuck.  Okay, I love you. Bye.  No, Jen, tell them where we are!  Oh. We're on Channel Street by a  lamppost.  - Love you. Bye. - Really great work.  I feel like nobody is gonna get in any trouble now.  (exhales)  - Thank you. Thank you. - (applause)  - Thank you. - We'll put this with the other ones.  Maybe we'll be okay. I mean, I can sing.  I sing all the time.  But you'll, like, do it different  from how you normally sing, right?  - What? - Uh, nothing.  I, uh, I admire you.  GENE: I can't feel my butt!  - Can you? - No, I can't feel your butt,  'cause I can't feel my hands.  I think I have a plan.  We can stay in here and get cold and die  Okay, let's call that option one.  Or my cousin actually doesn't work too far from here.  He's not gonna be happy about his ice cream truck,  but we can walk to him and wait there  until your parents show up.  Is this the hot cousin we're talking about here?  - Yes. - All right, let's move!  (applause)  Oh, my God. We're screwed.  We're screwed.  Wow! I am so glad you didn't die.  That was amazing.  All right. Bob and Linda,  you're up next. Get out there.  Hi, everyone. (chuckles nervously)  (quietly): Bob, I guess just start.  (clears throat)  (deep-voiced vocalizing)  - (falsetto vocalizing) -  Linda Ronstadt   -  And Linda Ronstadt  - (deep-voiced vocalizing)  -  Linda Ronstadt  - (vocalizing)  Yeah, yeah, yeah.   What's happening?  - (falsetto vocalizing) - Bobby, we should stop.  - It's weird. It's weird now. - Y-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um (clears throat) That-that Di  Uh, that didn't sound like when we r-rehearsed it,  which-which it was great. (chuckles)  (sighs) Look, I'm sorry.  I'm done pretending to be an interesting lady. It's late.  We should just go home and relieve the babysitter.  Oh, my gosh. The kids! I haven't checked my phone in,  like, two hours. Sorry, hang on.  Is this a play about someone with an old phone?  (gasps) There's a voice mail from Jen!  What? Are they okay?  Oh, my God. Oh, my God!  - What? What? - Oh, my God!  - Linda, what?! - Jen took the kids for a ride  in an ice cream truck, and the truck skidded off the road?!  They're waiting for us to come save 'em?!  They're on Channel Street! Where is that?  Oh. Now the phone makes sense.  But I still do not like the play.  It's not a play! This is real!  I know where Channel Street is. It's near here.  We're leaving! Goodbye!  Thank you, Maya and Becket! Thanks for the drinks!  Sorry you ran out of glasses and had to use jars.  Aw, my little babies!  - Ow! - Ow, my butt!  BOB: We should have stayed home.  Oh, my God, Bobby. We got to get to the kids.  Without a car. Everything's frozen over!  We're barely moving.  Wait, what if we sort of slide? Like this.  We can Kristi Yamaguchi it.  (grunting)  We're coming, kids!  (sighs) I miss the freezing cold ice cream truck.  I hope your cousin's office has an office dog  with one of those little barrels of cocoa around his neck.  We're here.  Wait, this is where your cousin works?  SINGER:  Oh, yeah.   Hey, Isaac, is my hot cousin around?  Oh, yeah, sure. Go right in.  Oh, wait, are those kids?  That's probably not okay.  Oh, you guys are already walking.  Okay. Uh, have fun.    TINA: Oh, thank God.  Excuse me. Officer?  Uh, O-Officer?  With really strong abs.  We got stuck on the ice, and now we can't get in touch  - with our parents and - ANNOUNCER: All right, ladies,  you're gonna slide out of your seats when you see  Rescue 9-1-Buns!  - Wait, we got kids in the club. - (music stops)  - Holster your buns. - Oh, got it.  You're not a real cop.  Okay. Nice badge.  So, is your cousin one of these first responders?  No, he's the pilot.  - Hi, Dave. - Hey, Jen.  - Hi. - All aboard.  Wait, that's for a train.  Um, never mind. Uh, hi.  Your truck is fine, but we had some issues with the ice.  Can we get warm in here while I call their parents?  Uh, yeah, I guess you can wait in the back.  Hope you guys don't hate sparkly costumes.  How sparkly are we talking?  Hello! Yoo-hoo!  George Washington says to get this show on the road!  And skate! And skate! And skate!  MAYA: Bob! Linda! Wait!  -(grunting) -What are you guys doing out here?  We're here to help you find your kids!  We also felt bad that you felt pressured to perform.  And we felt bad you guys embarrassed yourselves so much.  I mean, did we embarrass ourselves that much?  - Uh, no. No. Not at all. No. No. - No.  - (phone rings) - It's the kids!  Jen! Jen! What's going on?  Wait, what? You're where?  This is gonna be my new after-school hangout spot.  So many fun hat options.  - Okay, good. - LINDA: Kids!  Oh, thank God you're okay!  - Mommy! - You kids are in big trouble.  I'm assuming this is mostly your fault.  But I'm so glad you're okay.  - Hi, Jen. - Hey. You want a pickle?  Uh, yes, I do.  (chews) But I think we need to have a little talk  about your babysitting performance,  because it was not  Mmm. This pickle is really good.  Go easy on Jen.  She may have made a few mistakes along the way,  but, in the end, she brought us to the place  where we were meant to be.  Where we were always meant to be.  Oh, and this is Jen's hot cousin Dave.  - Hey. - Dad, Hot Cousin Dave  is in the ice cream and in the aviation business.  Yeah, he looks like he is.  Hey, thanks for inviting us to your party.  We tried to be spontaneous and fun and interesting  and keep up with you guys, but we couldn't do it.  Are you kidding?  Look at the night you're having.  - Look at Hot Cousin Dave. - On it.  Your kids drove an ice cream truck to a strip club,  - and now we're all here together. - Unbelievable.  That's way more interesting than anything  I thought we'd be doing tonight. (chuckles)  Yeah. I mean, it's not great.  Our kids are supposed to be home.  - But I see your point. - Mmm.  These pickles are so good.  You guys should eat a pickle.  Hey, do you guys want to do this again next week?  - Absolutely not. - No, but we can have dinner at,  like, 5:30 or 6:00 like normal people.  - Are you trying to say ""brunch""? - We're in.  We should head back. Don't want to miss the body painting.  I think I'm gonna get painted as a dragon tonight.  That'll be fun. Hey, you guys should come.  No. We'll wait out the weather here.  If that's okay.  I guess. This room's about to fill up with sweaty dancers.  - Interesting. - So everything worked out  and nobody's upset.  What a great night.  No, no, no. You're all grounded.  Okay, so we can't leave Pickles. Cool, cool.  ANNOUNCER: Well, well, well! We're celebrating  someone's 21st birthday tonight!  MISS LABONZ: Happy birthday to me!  Rescue 9-1-Buns, whoo   Rescue 9-1-Buns, yeah   Rescue 9-1-Buns, whoo   Oh, yeah   Get the whistle, toot-toot   Get the whistle, toot-toot   9-1-Buns, yeah   Uh!   You got buns, I got buns   Oh, no, an emergency, call 9-1-Buns   Rescue 9-1-Buns, whoo   Rescue 9-1-Buns, yeah   Rescue 9-1-Buns   Oh, yeah   Get the whistle, toot-toot   Get the whistle, toot-toot   9-1-Bun"
"1  LOUISE: Come on, Dad, speed it up.  We're barely outrunning that black cloud  that follows you around.  Yeah. Give my seat belt something to worry about.  - Oh, we're driving? - They're right, Bob.  I don't think you've driven this carefully  since you forgot to renew our insurance.  I-I'm not driving any faster  with a Riverbrook Lake Farms  - heritage turkey in the car, Lin. - Ugh.  Y-You've got precious cargo in your lap.  And a butt that won't quit.  - Thank you, Gene. - I've been on the waiting list  for five years for this bird.  And, yes, as much as I love you all,  I might actually love this turkey a little more right now.  At least he's calmed down since The Call.  (phone rings)  Hello? Yes?  I Oh, my God. Really?  Really? I got one?!  Are you freaking kidding me?!  (cackles) Yes!  You-You've made me the happiest man in the entire world!  Take this frozen hunk of junk. I don't need it.  I-I mean, I'm-I'm sorry.  Y-Yours are fine. I-I usually buy them here.  It's just, I-I got a Riverbrook Lake Farms turkey!  Yes! (laughs, whoops)  -He's not well. He'll tire himself out. -Yes! Yes!  Look, I know you guys don't get it, but these heritage turkeys  are the best turkeys you can buy.  They're like the Ferraris of turkeys.  Oh, Ferr-are they?  Guy Fieri is the Ferrari of Fieris.  Oh, it even comes with a little card  that tells you about your fancy bird.  ""Our turkey's name is Popcorn,  because her farmers sometimes gave her popcorn.""  - Oh. - Can I change my name  to Little Pieces of Cheese Any Time, Day Or Night?  There's a reason these turkeys cost five times more  than a grocery store turkey, guys.  They're fresh-killed. They've never been frozen.  And they're raised with the best care, in the best conditions.  So, we're gonna eat something  that's had a better life than us.  - Yeah. - Cool.  - Good night, Louise. - Night, Dad.  - Good night, Gene. - Good night, Papa.  - Night, Tina. - Night, Dad.  Good night, Popcorn. (high-pitched): Good night, Bob.  I can't believe you're really mine   You're a true gift from heaven   And I love you.   - Pretty song. - Oh, thanks.  Do you want me to set up a little bed in here  so you can sleep near your friend?  No, no, I'll-I'll set it up.  Oh, you're kidding.  (birds chirping)  (Bob humming a tune)  (quietly): Is Dad gonna leave Mom for Popcorn?  Let's be honest, he's never looked happier.  Ooh, Tina! Wow! Look at that!  What is that? Wh-What is it?  It's a Gratitude Tree. It's from the Thundergirls Handbook.  You write things you're grateful for on paper leaves  and stick them to the tree.  I'm thinking around 4:00  - for the leaf ceremony? - Leaf ceremony?  Yeah. We read our leaves aloud  and take turns taping them to the branches.  Huh. So it's like a Christmas tree, then?  No, this is different. It's a Gratitude Tree.  Looks like a Sad-itude Tree.  It just doesn't have any leaves on it yet.  But it will. Everyone gets eight leaves.  Eight? (chuckles) Whoa-oh!  That's basically homework.  Do they have to be leaves? What about pieces of salami?  They have to be paper. And make sure you don't tell anyone  about your leaves until the ceremony. It's more special that way.  Can I write ""I'm grateful for my shockingly deep belly button""?  You can put a whole hot dog in there.  Yep, whatever you want. But save it for the tree.  - Can I write ""When Tina wears deodorant""? - Save it.  - Croutons? - Throwing stars?  Save it for the tree! Save it for the tree!  Lin, did you do something to the oven?  - No. Why? - Uh, it's cold.  That's how they start.  Then you turn the thingy, and it warms up.  No, no, no, I turned it on 20 minutes ago  and it's not working.  Wh-Why hasn't it heated up?  I-Is it broken? Did we pay the gas bill?  Yes, we paid the gas bill.  I remember 'cause the check number ended in 69  and we high-fived.  - Why? - Never mind.  Bob Where'd he go?    Please, please, please, please, please, please, please  No!  Lin, it's not working downstairs either.  Okay, got it. Thanks so much.  Happy Thanksgiving to you!  Whew. All right, so our check didn't bounce.  Great. So why isn't the gas working?  Something about the main line getting a leak  so the gas has to be shut down for repairs on the whole block.  What? For how long?  They said it'd be back up in, uh,  - one or two days. - One or two days?!  - What about the turkey?! - I mean, can we freeze it?  What did you just say?  (mumbles): I just said maybe we could freeze it.  Lin, this is a Riverbrook Lake Farm heritage turkey.  You can't just stick it in the freezer.  It has to cook today. I-I timed it out perfectly.  (groans loudly)  Would it help if I donated some of my gas?  Oh! Oh, what about Gayle's?  She's in Florida with Mom and Dad.  We could cook there.  Doesn't Aunt Gayle keep her cats' litter box in her oven?  She also keeps her toilet paper in there and paper plates.  She's got it all figured out.  (groaning)  Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on.  - Oh, what about Teddy? - Yes! Teddy!  T-Teddy has an oven!  -(beep) -Hello? - Teddy.  Bob, can you hear me okay? I got a new earpiece.  I'm hands-free now, Bob.  I mean, I have hands, just not on my phone.  Oh. That's great, Teddy.  I'm calling because our gas is out  and we need to use your oven to cook our turkey.  It's a heritage turkey from Riverbrook Lake Farms.  - Oh. Uh, s-sounds important. - It's very, very important.  Right. No. Uh, well, my place is being fumigated,  so my oven's out of commission.  - Mm. - Geez. Aw, man!  Why, of all the stupid times I picked to get termites.  God! Oh, man.  I'm on my way to my mom's for dinner.  - Mm-hmm. - Her and my sister have the flu,  but I'm pretty sure they're not contagious anymore.  - Mm. - Hey, you could come to that.  - You could bring the whole family, huh? - Oh. No.  -Thanksgiving's saved. Thanks to me. -Teddy.  - No, thank you. We're good. - Right? No, no, no. Don't rule it out.  I'm bringing hand sanitizer! Enough for everybody!  No, no, no. I mean, we're-we're-we're fine.  But thank you for the offer.  Okay, well, if you change your mind,  you know, yeah, just write down her address  Yep. Okay. Happy Thanksgiving.  Hello?  (sighs)  What are you gonna do, Bob?  You've waited so long for this,  and now you can't even cook your very own  Riverbrook Lake Farms heritage turkey.  - Poor Popcorn. - I know. I'm so sorry.  Don't tell me. Tell her.  I'm so sorry, Popcorn. I won't let you go to waste.  I-I'll figure out how to cook you today.  I won't let you down.  - Either of you! - Well, I'm thankful for this.  Tina, hand me a leaf.  Hmm. Okay. Interesting.  That could work. Yes, yes.  (cackling)  Where's Dad? I don't hear any  of his dignified high-pitched moaning.  Uh, I heard him go outside. I figure let him cool off.  Then maybe we can order takeout or something.  Or we get a time machine and order takeout an hour ago?  - (Bob grunting loudly) - You guys hear that?  - What is that? - Is it coming from the alley?  -(grunting) -Dad's recycling the crap out of that box.  Bob, are you okay?  Lin! Bring down a couple chairs from the kitchen!  Hurry!  (grunts, pants)  We can do it here, in the alley.  Do what, Bob? What the hell are you talking about?  Cook the turkey, Lin!  I just watched a bunch of videos online.  There's these outdoor chefs. They make cooking fires outside.  You want to cook the turkey here?  - Is that even legal? - Does it matter?  I like Caveman Dad.  We can make a fire-pit. The chairs can hold the spit.  It's actually kind of perfect,  making a heritage turkey just like the pilgrims did.  In a stinky alley beside a dumpster?  And possibly human poop?  Just start looking for wood or anything else that can burn.  Wait, anything? We can burn  (stammers) just any-anything?  Yes! Wait, why are you so excited?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  Out of my way, people, quick,  before he changes his mind!  We're cooking that beautiful bird  if it's the last thing this family ever does!  -(grunting) -The last thing this family's doing  is touring the bridges of Madison County!  (grunts)  Sorry, Billy Joel. We did start the fire.  These pallets are a lot harder to break down than I thought.  I guess we should, uh, probably invest in an ax.  Or join one of those ax-of-the-month clubs.  MR. HUGGINS: What are you guys up to?  Whatever it is, it's on fire.  - Careful! - Hi, Mr. Huggins.  We're-we're actually building a cooking fire  since the gas is out. I've got a heritage turkey  from Riverbrook Lake Farms, so  Oh. I don't know what that is, but looks fun.  Yeah, you got anything to burn?  Hmm, I'm not sure. Um, does Italian dressing burn?  No, I don't think so.  Well-well, I got toothpicks, cinnamon and mint.  - Toss 'em down! - Okay.  Catch.  Yes!  You're welcome to join us, Mr. Huggins.  Oh. No, thanks. I'm headed to my girlfriend's place.  She's a vegetarian, and that's fine.  - Vegetarians are nice. I love it. - Good luck!  And don't burn down the neighborhood!  Seriously. Please don't.  (chuckling)  Look at that!  Okay, Linda, you turn the spit.  Tina, you spray the mop handle with this water  so it doesn't catch on fire.  Gene, Louise, you two go up the alley and find more stuff to burn.  Oh, you don't have to ask me twice, bay-beh!  The most important thing is keeping this fire going.  We have to keep this bird hot for only  four or five hours.  - What? - What? - Five hours?  We'll be fully grown women by then!  It'll be worth it, I promise.  - Just go. - Oh, and feel free to think  of gratitude leaves while you're out.  Oh, absolutely. I'm thankful you reminded me.  You guys, too. If you get any leaf ideas,  you can write them down on your hand like I did. See?  Damn it. Smudged. (sighs)  ""Diaper-phones""? That can't be right.  These? Can-can we burn these?  - Yep. Toss 'em in. - Yes.  - Twine? - Toss it.  Ha-ha!  - This? What about this? - Definitely.  Burn, baby, burn!  The fire's getting too low.  Lin, can you go inside and maybe find more stuff to burn?  - Tina, can you turn the spit? - Okay.  What am I supposed to get from upstairs?  I don't know. Anything. I-I'm desperate.  All right.  ""Thank you, Linda. I love you, Linda.""  - Thank you! - You guys are cute.  Dang it. Doesn't seem to be anything else around here  - to burn. - I keep suggesting those boxes.  - Gene, they're soaked in pee. - I'm sorry! I had to go.  Oh, how 'bout this?  A tote bag that says what we're all thinking.  Better than pee boxes. Let's do it!  I'm calling your mom. She's been up there for too long.  - We-we need fuel here. - (line rings)  - LINDA: Hello? - Lin, wh-what are you doing?  Oh, I got looking for stuff to burn  and found a box of old artwork by the kids.  Aw. Remember that little squirrel Gene drew  when he was three?  It says, ""I'm nuts about you, Mommy and Daddy,""  except I wrote it 'cause he was too little.  Oh, and Louise's Popsicle picture frame from kindergarten!  We can't burn this, Bob. We can't.  Lin, we don't have to burn anything you don't want to.  Just grab stuff like newspapers, junk mail, um,  uh, blankets and, uh, pillows?  Oh, oh. And our-our Valentine's Day cards from Teddy.  Oh, and here's that picture Tina drew of us!  Oof. I look like a tweaked-out Muppet.  Please just come down. The fire's getting low.  All right, all right! I'm coming, I'm coming!  Aw, egg carton turtle!  - I love you. (kissing) - Lin!  I said I'm coming!  - Thank God you guys are back. - You can burn this.  Unless you have some jazz you want to put in it?  Is that it? There's more, right?  - Th-This can't be it. - We picked these alleys clean.  Dad, it's Thanksgiving, not Put Out Your Combustible Trash Day.  Well, I definitely didn't pee on anything usable,  - that's for sure. - Come on, come on.  Let's just see how it burns already!  (all coughing)  -Ugh, you disappoint me, Jazz Bag. -(door opens)  Got some things, got some things   Stuff to burn, but not this little guy   He's a turtle, little turtle   I can't tell which one of you made him   But I love him, he's a cutie.   Didn't Aunt Gayle make that when we did homemade gifts  - that one year? - Oh, yeah.  No, I made it for Mom's birthday.  Oh, God! Oh, God! Get it out!  Get it out! Oh, you're okay. (blows)  I gotcha now. Mommy's gotcha now.  All right, the alleys are dead to us.  Um, let me think.  Oh! Uh, maybe you two would have more luck  at a place where wood actually comes from.  Woodstock? Nice try, hippie. It's over.  No, Gene. The woods in the park.  I'll go, too. The faster we get this bird cooked,  the faster we can get to the tree ceremony.  Apologies to everyone for the delay.  - We'll get there. - Great. The more hands the better.  And hurry, please. I'll take over rotation duty.  - (laughs) Doody. - Louise.  - Doody. - No.  - Doody. - Stop.  Bring back good stuff to burn or don't come back at all!  - Just kidding. Kinda. - Bob, do they really have to go?  We've barely been together all day.  Lin, yes, they do.  Well, this isn't how I pictured our Thanksgiving.  Everyone split up  and us sitting in a dirty alley, Mad Max style.  Look, I know it's not ideal, but the turkey looks amazing.  The gas being out is maybe the best thing  - that's ever happened to us. - (siren chirps)  - Oh, crap. - Maybe they're just lost?  Interesting setup you have here.  Oh, thanks. I mean, Th-this  this is okay, right?  I think you already know the answer to that question.  Uh, Bob, right? Bob's Burgers?  Usually your fires are on the inside.  Uh, yeah. That was me.  Thanks again for putting those out.  This is totally under control.  I-I followed specific directions  from professionals on the Internet,  - so - So, Thanksgiving, huh?  Stuffing, am I right? Wh-What is stuffing?  Just a bunch of stuff? I mean, what is that crap?  This is just a rare, onetime thing. The gas is out  and we've got nowhere else to cook.  You see, that's a heritage turkey  from Riverbrook Lake Farms.  Oh, wow! A heritage turkey?  - Yeah. - From Riverbrook Lake Farms?  - Yeah. - Put this out.  Oh, um, but it actually needs a couple more hours at least  This is me being nice, Bob.  If I have to come back,  - there will be a lot of water. - Mm-hmm.  - Your turkey won't like it. - Mm-hmm.  And neither will you,  - because you'll get fined. - Mm.  - You don't want that. - Mm-hmm.  Okay, so get rid of this whole situation,  or else (imitates hose spraying)  - You're doing a hose sound? - Yep.  - Got it. - Bye.  Sorry, hon.  Maybe we can hoist the turkey inside  and stick a bunch of candles under it.  How long would that take?  Like, a week? Bob?  - Bob, what are you doing? - Lin, these embers are holding up.  I mean, once the kids come back with more wood,  we can finish roasting this bird  before the fire department comes back.  No! No, no, no.  We can't afford getting any sort of write-ups or tickets.  Unless it's two parking tickets,  'cause I got two parking tickets, by the way. Sorry.  Lin, I have to do this.  For years, I thought I'd always be just some schlub  on a waiting list, and now look.  See how crispy that skin is getting?  See how the juices are starting to flow?  This is my Independence Day, Lin.  And I'm Will Smith,  and I'm telling this turkey, ""Welcome to Earth.""  And it's saying, ""Oh, I like it here. I'm gonna stay a while.""  And I'm like, ""Oh, I'm also gonna cook you and eat you.""  And it's like, ""Of course. You're the boss!""  Fine, Bob, calm down!  You're getting your giblets in a twist.  Let's cook this bird.  Yeehaw!  - Oh, my face! - Oh, God. Sorry.  (sighs) This is ridiculous. We've barely found any sticks.  Somebody must've Blair Witched them all.  Just when you get into sticks,  everyone else is into sticks, too.  Lot of beer bottles. Did the squirrels have a party?  Whoa, whoa. Guys?  I think we just solved all our problems.  - Whoa. - Whoa.  (chuckles): Oh, Mama!  Okay, we got to get this thing home.  Let's pick her up.  Tina, Gene? Go ahead.  (Tina and Gene straining)  - It's too heavy. - Ugh, fine.  Here, let me help. One, two, three.  - Okay! Forget it. - (Tina and Gene grunt)  We're gonna have to roll this son of a bitch.  Or put a saddle on it and teach it to run.  Easy, girl. Shh, shh.  (all panting)  (all screaming)  - (all grunt) - Well, we gave it our best shot.  No! Come on!  (all grunting)  Okay. This is going pretty good.  (all grunting)  Aah!  Those were just practice rolls.  This is the real deal.  (all grunting)  -(Tina panting) -I'm so hungry I can't see anymore.  - (grunts) - We're too weak.  Well, look, we get back, and, Gene, you get your turkey,  Tina, you get your tree ceremony, and me,  I get my fire. Everybody wins!  We're rolling this logging log-damned log home,  log-damn it!  - Now push! - (grunting)  - (panting) - Okay, nice work, everyone.  (exhales) Now let's take this baby back  and be hero !  - It's headed right into traffic! - (screams)  - No! - TINA: Oh, my God!  Yeah. So, like I was saying,  let's get this log back and be, um, heroes.  - Cool. - Great.  What are you doing?  - Putting my socks in the fire. - Right.  It's starting to get dark out.  Should we go get the kids? I'm getting worried.  -Yeah, I know. We need that wood. -What?  - And also I hope they're safe. - A tree fell in the forest.  We didn't hear it, but we found it.  Oh, my babies are back.  Oh, wow, that's huge.  - Yeah. Too huge, actually. - Wait, what?  It's too big, Louise. How would I burn that?  And I can't chop it up. You guys were supposed to get sticks.  Where are the sticks?  This is a mega-stick. What's happening?  Would you like a suggestion where to stick this log?  - Tina! - You heard me.  We risked our lives for this thing.  And also possibly other people's lives,  but we're not gonna talk about that right now.  Come on, let's light her up! I need this!  Louise, no.  (sighs) Oh, we were so close,  and now there's only a few embers left.  We've got nothing else to burn.  - Did someone just spit in my eye? - God?  Oh, crap! Are you kidding me?!  Well, the day's not a total loss.  We can still go in and do the tree ceremony.  No! We're not going in, okay? We can make this work.  We just need to put a tarp over the turkey.  Quick, get a tarp.  Bob, stop it. We don't have any tarp.  Hold on! We can still save it!  Look, I-I can make a tent out of my clothes, all right?  I'll take my jacket off. (grunting)  Aah! Okay, here we go.  All right. What else can we burn?  - Everyone, empty your pockets. - No!  That's enough, Bob. It's late, and it's raining,  and we're all tired and hungry.  Now, I'm gonna go in and make some sandwiches  and cold beans for the kids, and you're welcome to join us.  But we're not staying out here anymore, okay? We're done.  Bye, fire. You're the best friend  I've ever had in my whole life.  Bob? You coming in or what?  I can't, Linda.  Right. Fine. Enjoy your hoity-toity turkey.  - Come on, kids. - Put a shirt on, Iggy Pop.  Your meaty breasts are reminding us what we're missing out on.  Here, my little chickadees. Sorry this had to be  our Thanksgiving dinner and your father lost his mind  - over an expensive turkey. - It's still Thanksgiving?  When will this nightmare end?!  Oh, it could be worse. Probably not, though.  Oh, this doesn't feel right.  Us in here and your dad out there.  We should all be together.  (grunting)  - I'll be right back. - Tina, where you going?  Oh, good. We're going back outside into the rain again.  Okay, but I'm taking this to go.  - (grunting) - Dad? You okay?  (panting): Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.  I-I'm just seeing if I can chip away  at some of this wet bark and get to the dry wood underneath.  I-I got a few chips off already. Kinda. They're mushy.  - Dad. - Yeah?  Maybe burning this will help.  You're you're-you're giving me your tree?  I know how special this turkey is to you, so here.  Tina, wow. That's so nice of you.  I-I mean, it's gonna burn really quickly,  but it's better than nothing.  Wait. What the hell am I saying?  Oh, my God. I've gone nuts, haven't I?  Just a little. Or a lot.  - I'm not gonna burn your tree, Tina. - Oh, thank God.  Guys, I-I'm so sorry for acting like a total idiot.  It's just turkey.  I mean, it's a glorious, heavenly, super-special  Riverbrook Lake Farms heritage turkey  that I'd give my whole life for, but still.  I'm sorry if I ruined Thanksgiving.  I'll-I'll go do Tina's Gratitude Tree.  Oh! Would you look at that? It's tree o'clock.  Aw, we love you, Bobby.  Okay, lets go back inside. Go, go! Go, go, go, go!  Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.  - I'm just gonna clean up this - (siren wails)  Oh, crap, they're back.  You must be a big fan of hoses, huh?  - No. No, no, I'm-I'm really not. - All right.  Connect the hose, fellas.  Okay, no, no, no, no, no. I-I was just abou Ow!  - (all gasp) - (screams)  ""I am grateful for the ocean.""  It's always out there, doing its thing.  - Thanks, ocean. - Great leaf, Mom.  I-I mean, good. Okay, time for the final leaf.  - Hell yeah! - Dad?  Bob, stop staring at that thing.  You're torturing yourself. We should just chuck it.  No, I-I'm not ready to yet.  (clears throat) Maybe figure it out  - after the final leaf, Dad. - (sighs) Okay.  My, uh, final leaf says, ""I'm grateful the firefighter  let us off with a stern warning and not a fine.""  I-I had to write it on both sides.  I think she let you off because your crying  made her so uncomfortable.  Right. Well, I actually have an extra leaf  I saved till last because it's the most important one.  -Wha -Final leaf is kind of the final leaf,  but I'll allow it.  Okay, so, my final final leaf  is that I am grateful  for all of you.  - My family. - Aw. Family.  - Huh. - I mean, that one's kind of obvious.  Feels a little basic, to be honest.  Um, I thought we weren't allowed  to comment on other people's leaves.  You guys didn't say anything when Gene put up the leaf  about his imaginary friend Ken ""surviving that fall.""  He's real, and so is his GoFundMe page,  which you have donated to generously!  - Wait, what? - Nothing.  (sighs) Okay, I'm ready to throw it away.  (sighs) Oh, Popcorn. Look at you.  I'm so sorry I failed you.  Huh. It's not pink.  Mm. Mm-hmm.  LINDA: Bob, what? What are you saying?  - Mm-hmm. Mm! - You choking or happy?  - (laughing): Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! - You choking or happy?  Mm! Oh, my God. It's delicious.  - Gimme, gimme! Mm! Mm! - Let me try, let me try.  - Mm! - Get these sandwiches out of my face!  - I need turkey! - Oh, my God.  Oh, that's amazing.  You did it, you messy mass of a man!  Dibs on the charred drumstick!  (laughs) This is the best thing I've ever made!  Including you guys! Maybe.  - Oh, so hungry. - Dad,  stop crying all over the turkey!  It's gonna make it too salty!  I can't believe you're really mine   You're a true gift from heaven   And I love you   Riverbrook Lake Farms heritage turkey   You were fresh killed, never frozen   Raised in the best conditions   Cost five times more than a regular turkey, yeah   -  I can't believe you're really mine  -  It's really yours   -  You're a true gift from heaven  -  Gift from heaven   -  And I love you  -  It loves you, too   -  I can't believe you're really mine  -  You paid so much   -  You're a true gift from heaven  -  Hallelujah   - CHORUS:  And I love you.  - BOB: Good night, Popcorn."
"1  - BOB: Okay, who wants eggs? - TINA: Yes, please.  - LOUISE: Yes, hurry it up. - Gene? Where's Gene?  I think he was getting ready to do  a performance of The Gene Show.  Oh, right. The Gene Show.  Um, do you think he wants eggs?  Does this answer your question?  Five hundred twenty-five thousand   Six hundred eggs!   I'll take that as a yes.  Do you kids want scrambled or fried?  - Scrambled, please. - Fried.  Does this answer your question? Scrambly, scrambly, scrambly,  - scrambly, scrambly, scrambly - Yep. Got it.  Oh! Oh! Oh, what'd I miss? Did The Gene Show already start?  So far he's done one song and one performance piece  - as a scrambled egg. - Darn it!  But don't worry, Mother, as a special treat  for our audience today, I am offering  exclusive Gene Show merch.  - Is that my shirt? - It can be, for four dollars.  I'll take it! I love The Gene Show.  It's like having world-class entertainment right here in our home.  - I enjoy it. - You know what I think is entertaining?  - (high-pitched): Aah! - That.  I-I-I don't like that, when you poke my love handles.  LOUISE: You're starting to like it.  Gene, look, I'm a fan of all your performing stuff, too,  especially up here in the apartment.  Down in the restaurant, it can be a little you know.  No. What are you trying to say?  Yeah. What are you trying to say?  I'm just saying, sometimes less is more.  Wrong! Less is never more!  Just ask Al Pacino and mayonnaise!  - (high-pitched): Aah! - Huh. That lives up to the hype.  BOB: Teddy, do you want fries with that?  Uh, no, thanks. Trying to stay slim.  Really? I mean, right, sure.  (sniffs) Wait a minute.  - Teddy, are you wearing cologne? - Me? No!  (sniffs) It's Thundersports Body Spray.  LOUISE: If it's a spray and it goes on boys, Tina knows it.  Teddy, is there something Or someone  You haven't told us about?  What? No. No. No. No.  Okay, yes. Yeah, I've been spending a lot of time  around Kathleen lately.  Aw. The Irish lady from that apartment building?  - That's great, Teddy. - Yeah, she got a new job  as the accountant for a local theater company,  The Happy Mask Sad Mask Players,  and she asked me to help them out with their latest play.  They want me to build the whole set  using old wood from past productions  and, like, six nails.  Turns out theater companies don't make much money.  Papa, do we work at a theater company?  - Louise. - Also, there's a little drama  in their drama, 'cause yesterday the one kid in the play  left the production to shoot a shampoo commercial.  Eh, you should've seen his hair, though.  - It was like a field of wheat. - Damn.  Now they're holding emergency auditions for a replacement.  The show opens in two days.  (gasps) Maybe Gene should audition for that part!  He's always entertaining people. Maybe he's destined to be a  (gasps) theater person!  Mm, I don't know.  I mean, is what Gene does theater?  Hi. Can I get you anything else? Maybe one of these?  Jiggly, jiggly, jiggly, jiggly   He's a natural! What's the role, Teddy?  - Well, it's small, but it's - He'll do it!  Wait, Lin, you don't even know  if this something Gene wants to do.  If what is something I want to do?  Teddy was just asking if you want to be in a play.  Does this answer your question? Jiggly, jiggly   Okay, well, I'm glad you're excited.  It's just, you realize you still have to audition, right?  Not a problem. Can another kid do this?  - Gene, stop. We have customers. - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow  So talented!  This counts as me mopping.    Aw. A tiny theater.  Full of big dreams. And a weird smell.  Follow me. I'll take you backstage.  That's theater speak for ""behind the stage.""  Ooh.  Oh, hey, Teddy. Did you bring some friends?  Kathleen! Hi.  I mean, hey.  I mean, hi. (chuckles nervously) I mean, hey.  Uh, you remember Linda and Gene Burger.  - Oh, yeah. How are you? - Great to see you, Kathleen!  I hear you're the new accountant here.  Yeah. I get to see all the free shows I want.  Unfortunately, they're at this theater.  (giggles) Eh, I'm kidding.  Consider me The Phantom of the Spreadsheet.  (laughing loudly)  - Sorry. - Not much cash flow, though.  I don't even need a calculator.  This is a fingers-only kind of deal.  (laughs loudly, sighs)  (quietly): Easy, Teddy.  Hello. So, you're Gene? The young thespian Teddy was talking about?  And I'm his mom, Linda.  Hellooo. That was a theater hello.  I'm Donovan, the director.  Let's knock this audition out quick.  It's tech week, and on top of losing an actor, I just lost a stagehand.  Ironically, he got a job at Foot Locker.  I love the high-intensity environment!  I can't imagine what it's like when you have a packed house.  (chuckles) That's very funny.  We never have a packed house.  We've sold seven tickets for this show.  Seven? That's like eight!  Oh, wait, that's still not good.  No one goes to local theater. I probably should have listened  to my father and gone into something safe.  He owned a safe company called Something Safe.  Let's do this, shall we?  You're gonna be great. Now, I'm gonna give you  ten kisses real quick.  (grunting, stammering)  Okay, okay. Go, go.  (clears throat)  Gene Belcher. American boy.  Special skills include sassy sounds, smooth skin,  - (deep voice): heavy bones. - Just start anytime, please.  Right. Okay. For my audition today,  I will be doing the fight scene from Mechagodzilla vs. Mothra,  - set to an original funky beat. - Stop.  Stop. You know this isn't a musical, right?  It's the American classic, A Potluck in the Grass  by Alabama O'Callahan, which you hopefully read?  Oh. Um, pssh, yeah.  Which character am I auditioning for again?  Quiet Eli. You know what?  Why don't you just say this line for me  ""Gosh, mister, those beans smell delicious.""  (high-pitched): Gosh, mister, those beans smell delicious.  - Great. Not that. - (booming voice): Gosh, mister,  those beans smell delicious!  - Okay. Not that, either. - What about this? Damn, girl,  that pad Thai smells yum-my!  - What? - What?  - Why did you say that? - Why did I say what?  Why did you say ""pad Thai""?  I thought I'd switch it up.  Also, doesn't pad Thai sound good right now?  Please say the line.  All right. Gosh, mister, those beans smell delicious,  even though I'd rather have some pad Thai!  You know what? I think we're done.  Wait. Really?  Did I get the part?  Um, I said we're done,  which is something we say in the theater  when we are done  with you.  LINDA: Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.  (singsongy): You were incredible.  Pretty good.  - No, I wasn't. - Yes, you were.  - Let's just go home. - Uh, you know what?  I, uh, I-I realized I forgot something inside.  I dropped my breath mint. I'll be right back.  I'm sorry, but I just don't think  Gene's right for Quiet Eli.  Trust me, he can do it.  He's a natural entertainer.  I'm sure he is. He's just a bit much.  So then who's gonna get the part?  I don't know. Maybe I'll just ask my cousin.  He's 26 but he has braces.  Wait! Uh, what if we made an arrangement?  Maybe, uh, I could work for you for free.  - You need a stagehand, right? - I do, but maybe not you.  Hey, what if I help you sell some tickets?  That's the toughest job in the whole show, honey.  I can do it, honey.  I can pack this house for opening night.  But if I promise a sell-out, will you promise to cast  - my little Genie Spice Superstar? - Throw in that first thing  you said about working as a stagehand,  and I think this might just be his big break.  (laughs): Oh, my God! I'm gonna be a stage mom  and a stagehand what a day!  Guess who's gonna be in a play, just like Lin-Manuel Hamiltons?  You're looking at Quiet Eli, baby!  Gosh, mister, those beans smell delicious!  - These are fries, right? - Well, I'm glad  Gene finally has something to focus his energy on.  I told you this was a good idea.  He's gonna be a great Quiet Eli.  I mean, he's not gonna be a quiet Quiet Eli.  Does the director guy know that?  Definitely!  Yeah. He knows that. Yeah.  I mean, I guess he gave him the role, so  (chuckles): Exactly.  He gave him the role. He totally did, fair and square.  Okay. Why do you sound weird?  - Here's the thing, Bob. - Oh, boy.  I may have kinda sorta persuaded the director  by promising to sell all the tickets for opening night  if he let Gene be in the play.  - What?! - It's only 60 tickets.  Actually, he already sold seven, so it's 60 minus seven,  which is fifty (mumbles)  - Lin, does Gene know that you did this? - No, and he doesn't need to.  You should've seen his face after the audition, Bob.  The only time I've seen him that sad is when Louise told him  the California Raisins died in a plane crash.  - Mm. - I had to do something.  Now he thinks the director loved him, and he feels better.  That's a lot of tickets, Lin. How are you gonna sell them all?  How are we gonna sell them all? But mostly you,  because I'm gonna be very busy with rehearsals.  -No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no -Just take 'em.  Please? Please?  - Aw, fine. - Oh, thank you, Bobby.  (kiss) Listen, we got to go to the theater.  I'll see you tonight. Gene, let's go! We're late for rehearsal!  I always wanted to say that.  Oh, my God. (high-pitched) Aah!  Guys, you realize I'm cooking with fire, right?  They're love handles, Dad. We're just giving them love.  Sorry if you can't handle it.  Well, you're not allowed to poke 'em anymore.  Are you sure you're not just crabby because Mom tricked you  into selling a million tickets to Gene's play?  - Mm, maybe. - Maybe we can help.  -Really? -Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. What's in it for us?  Uh, how about two days off from the restaurant?  That's a start. But come on, you know what we want.  (groans) Fine. I'll-I'll let you poke me in the love handles  as much as you want for a month.  - Holy crap. I'm in. - Me, too.  But we're gonna need one quick poke in advance.  No, no, no, you're not getting any of these bad boys  until you sell the tickets.  Firm but fair Unlike your body.    Kathleen, look! I'm on the phone!  Ha! I'm just kidding. It's a prop.  Oh, you're on the phone. I'm sorry.  It's okay. It's just Teddy.  He's calling from  I guess right behind you.  - Yeah, there he is. - Hi. Uh, just checking  to see if you need anything. I'm going home to poop.  I mean, I'm going home to get a coffee.  Wanted to see if you Damn it! Aah! Stupid!  Mr. Ambrose? You're in this play?  No. I was actually looking for the school library,  but I got lost and wandered into this building.  Where am I? Yes, I'm in this play!  I think I followed that.  So you're replacing ""The Hair""?  That's what we called the boy who had your role.  Yeah. I'm the new kid. Everybody calls me ""The Face.""  - Because I have a face. - Well, let me tell you  everything you need to know. That's Jules.  She's a yoga instructor and a downward-facing drag.  She's semi-hooking up with Eric, who's not not straight.  And that's Jeremy, who's not not not messing around with Eric.  And that's Janice. She's Mormon.  And believe me, they're all trying to get  - some of this. - Okay, cast, big day.  Last dress rehearsal before opening night.  - (Linda clears throat loudly) - Oh, that's right.  As many of you know, one of our actors recently left,  so now we have a new Quiet Eli Gene Belcher. Yay.  Yay! Also hi.  I'm Linda, the new stagehand.  So let me know if you guys need a hand with anything.  - I got two. (chuckles) - DONOVAN: Okay,  let's run the show from the top, shall we?  (Southern accent): Summertime,  and all my food is spoiled rotten to the core.  Much like this Charmin' Southern town,  it seems fine, but under the surface  somethin' doesn't smell right.  We've been invited to a potluck at the Pomeroys'.  Too bad there's nothing lucky about this pot.  Oh, I sure do love you, Edwin Abernathy.  I wonder if Cameron Calhoun  is gonna bring his beans  Who's that there? Come here, child.  Gene, that's your cue.  Oh, okay!  Give me those beans, you son of a bitch!  - (mimics electric guitar) - Ha!  Stop, stop, stop.  Gene, that's not your line.  And, also, nowhere does it say the character is topless.  Mm, I thought it was implied.  Well, it's not.  - Just say the line, as written. - Got it.  Eric, give him the cue again.  Come here, child!  Gosh, mister, those beans smell delicious.  - Thank you. - Now let's potluck!  I'm Quiet Eli, baby!  (stifled chuckling): Oh, God.  Let's take a break.  I need to speak with my stagehand.  Linda!  So, that'll be one burger of the day?  Tina, aren't you gonna offer this nice man a Thespian Combo?  - Oh, right. - What's the Thespian Combo?  It's a great value, actually. It comes with fries, a soda  and three tickets to an amazing play tomorrow night.  How much is it?  Hmm. Let me see here. Three plus two  - $40. - Mm, no.  - Get out. - What?  Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean that.  Ugh. Tina, get this man his burger.  On it. One burger of the day coming right up  for the guy who hates art and everything beautiful.  Tina, Louise, can I talk to you for a sec?  Please stop harassing the customers.  That's how it works, Dad.  No one willingly buys theater tickets.  Well, you're gonna have to find a different approach.  This one's not working.  Okay. (sighs)  Maybe a poke to help us think?  No. No ticket stubs, no  sticking chubs.  Ugh! Temptress!  Okay, you know what, I think we're gonna have  to sell these tickets the old-fashioned way.  - On a horse? - No, not on a horse.  We go out and pound the pavement and find some suckers.  I mean, theater lovers.  And by theater lovers, I mean suckers.  Okay, let's roll, T. Come on.  - Poke ya later. - Oh, my God.  DONOVAN: I don't know if you've noticed, Linda,  but your son is chewing up the scenery out there.  Literally chewing.  Plus, he also ate a bunch of makeup.  Oh, he's just excited.  He'll get it. I promise.  Just give him a chance.  I'm trying, but I don't think this is working.  What? No. We had a deal.  You let my son shine and I fill your theater with behinds.  Gene just had to get the sillies out. That's all.  And they're pretty much mostly out now.  Mostly. I promise.  Kinda.  Okay, remember, call time tomorrow is 6:30.  So get some rest.  Or do what I do: lie awake  and listen to your roommate do stuff with your other roommate  on the other side of the wall.  Hopefully, we'll have a full house for opening night.  I'm just lookin' over at you for no reason, Linda.  So, you feel ready for tomorrow?  Do you know both your lines?  I think so. Is it weird that Donovan yells at me  every time I talk? Or is he just being hard on me  'cause he believes in me?  He believes you're gonna pack the house, that's for sure.  Because of the way I shimmy, shammy and shine?  No, because your mother promised to sell all the tickets  for opening night so you'd get the part, right?  - What? - Oh, I can see  by your face you didn't know that.  I feel like I shouldn't have said anything.  Oh, look, someone's calling me.  I'm walking away. Oh, no !  Great job, my little Broadway Genie Weenie.  You ready to go home?  - How dare you? - Wha ?  What-what are you talking about?  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You promised to sell tickets to get me this part?!  Wh-What tickets? What-what part?  Stop acting. This is no place for acting!  Fine. I did it, Gene. But-but it was  just 'cause I wanted everyone to see The Gene Show.  Take me home. I'm going to my room  and I'm not coming out for dinner because I'm mad  but also because I already have a bunch of food in there  that I've been saving over the course of the last year!    LINDA: He hasn't come out of his room all morning.  I can't believe he's still so upset at me.  I can kind of believe it.  Oh, because Mom lied to him?  And he feels like a fraud?  - Yeah. - (sighs)  I'm gonna go try and talk to him again.  Well, I guess we don't have to sell tickets anymore.  No, no, no. A deal's a deal, Dad.  We're selling those tickets.  Your love handles are still in play.  All we have to do is find people who have disposable cash,  a bunch of free time and nothing to live for.  Like Grandma and Grandpa?  But they're in Florida.  Oh, Tina.  You beautiful, brilliant idiot.  Thank you?  I know where we can sell these tickets.  Come with me.  Gene, let me in.  Go away! Or, better yet,  go read the Holy Bribe-Le!  Listen, I only made that deal with Donovan  because you just seemed so down after the audition.  I was down. Donovan didn't seem to be into my whole deal,  but then you said he actually loved my whole deal.  I mean, he didn't say that he loved you, exactly.  He said you were a bit much.  But-but what does that even mean?  I think you're perfect.  Am I, Mom? If you lied to me about the play,  how can I trust you about anything?!  I'm starting to think I might not be  a better singer than Adele!  No, you are! You are!  Listen, I'm gonna go make you something sweet, okay?  And then I'm gonna put something sweet on top of it  and then add sugar to it and then kiss it.  I love you! I hate you! I love you! But go away! But do that!  Bob, am I doing this wrong?  That's so much sugar. So, yes.  No, I'm talking about the parenting stuff.  I feel like I'm screwing it up.  I mean, yeah.  - Bob! - No, no, no, no, no.  I mean, we both screw up.  All the time.  Sometimes we're okay, I think.  But a lot of times, we screw up.  Well, this week, I screwed up.  - That's for sure. - Don't be so hard on yourself.  Remember when I drove for 20 minutes with Tina's hair caught  in the car door because I was listening  to that audiobook by the Rock?  - Yeah. That was bad. - I just think,  as long as we're trying our best,  that's as good as we can do.  At least, that's what the Rock said.  - He's so handsome. - Great body.  I-I just think Gene is Gene.  For a million different reasons.  And-and that's great.  You wanted to find a place for him to do his thing,  which is sweet, but maybe it just wasn't the right place.  - Yeah. - Which is totally fine.  (sighs) You're right.  And you know what? I'm gonna call Donovan  and tell him Gene doesn't want to be in his dumb play.  Hi, Donovan. It's Linda.  Linda, I don't have time to talk.  I'm dealing with an emergency.  All of my actors are sick with the flu.  What? How'd that happen?  Well, let's just say it's a very close cast.  Oh, well. Guess it's good we didn't sell any  of your tickets then, huh?  I guess it kind of worked out.  The show's sold out, Linda.  What? It is? Who sold all the tickets?  Guess what. We sold all the tickets.  Oh, boy.  A deal's a deal, Dad.  Now get ready to squeal.  How'd you guys do it?  Old folks' home.  They're gonna bus 'em in.  That theater's gonna smell like menthol rub and soup.  I am freaking out.  I'm gonna have a packed house  and I've got no actors!  Okay, okay. Calm down, Donovan. Breathe.  (deep, growling breaths)  Okay, maybe don't breathe. That sounds bad.  I'm sorry all your actors gave each other the flu  or the horny flu or whatever they call it.  But I don't think Gene is gonna be part of your play either.  I'm worried if he stays in it, it'll crush his little spirit.  Donovan? Hello?  Oh, he hung up.  Hello, Mother.  You look just as I remember you.  Hi, Gene.  I thought about what Donovan said,  and I realize now that I am a bit much.  And I'm ready to rein it all in,  much like Jim Carrey in his acclaimed dramatic roles.  No, Gene, no.  - (gasps, squeals) - Boom goes the dynamite.  This better not be one of those plays where they come up to you  in the aisle and meow at you.  GENE: So, wait, everyone got the flu?  - How'd that happen? - They all gave it  to each other by, um, uh, being friendly.  Theater, huh? Sounds kind of interesting.  Tina.  Anyways, I just want to say it again, Gene.  You don't have to do this play if you don't want to.  No, Mother. I've made up my mind.  I want to play Quiet Eli. Quietly.  - As written. - Oh, boy.  Well, this Gene's fun.  All right. Good luck in there, Lin.  Tina, Louise, let's go find a place to stand in the back,  with my love handles tucked in my pants  and pressed against the wall.  Is that Donovan under the cushions?  (muffled): Yes. No. I'm not here. I'm dead.  I finally have a sold-out show but no show.  (clears throat) Hello, Donovan.  Pleasure to see you today.  Okay. Now he's freaking me out.  He's fine.  Look, Donovan, we don't have much time.  And Gene says he wants to be in the play now.  So how are we gonna do this?  Well, I did have one idea.  Really? What is it?  What if  I just went out there and played all the parts?  Okay. Uh, how would that work?  I mean, the people in the audience don't know the play.  They barely know they're at a play.  All they know is there's a potluck  'cause it's in the title.  That's all I know, and I'm the stagehand.  Exactly. What if I just go out onstage  and try to tell the story by myself?  With Quiet Eli.  Uh, sure. Look, it might work.  It might not. But I don't have any other choice.  So I'm gonna try it.  Crowd's getting restless out there.  I mean, not restless.  But there's a lot of candy wrapper sounds.  All right. Well, I guess it's showtime, everyone.  And just remember, you can't sit on any of the furniture.  Or lean on it. I was not told  that it had to be structurally sound.  It's pretty dangerous.  Anyway, have fun out there.  Gene, baby, come here. I want to say something.  I know I really messed up by not being honest with you.  But I just want you to know that even if I wasn't your mom,  even if I was just some lady who smelled like meat  and was a great dancer,  I would still be a fan of The Gene Show.  - Really? - Definitely.  I'd be your number one fan.  Are you a bit much?  Of course you are, and that's great.  And sometimes people can handle it, and sometimes they can't.  But sometimes it's perfect.  And, I mean, hey, you got good timing.  You got it from me.  That and my full bottom.  Ha! See? Timing.  (man coughs)  (Southern accent): Summertime.  And all my food is spoiled (British): rotten.  (Southern): It's kind of like this charming Southern town.  (regular voice): Meanwhile, over here  (high-pitched): I sure do love you, Edwin Abernathy.  I'm so glad we're married.  (regular voice): Eh Oh, i-is, um,  what my wife said.  To me.  - I don't like this. - (coughing)  What's happening?  Did the play start?  Oh, no. Maybe this was not the best idea.  The poor guy's dying out there.  (deep voice): Too bad there's nothing lucky about this pot.  (quietly): And then I go over here and, um, I  I wonder if Cameron Calhoun's gonna bring his beans!  And this would be a Okay, this would be a scene change.  - What is this? - This is terrible. - I'll just go over yonder,  -uh, here -Gene, he's dying. Get out there.  And get some bean sauce!  - I'm Quiet Eli, baby! - (gasping)  (mimics electric guitar)  Oh. Uh, uh, Quiet Eli.  Are you, uh, um, here for the potluck?  Does this answer your question?  - A-jiggly, jiggly, jiggly, jiggly, - (laughter)  - jiggly, jiggly, jiggly, jiggly. - Oh, uh, uh, right.  Yes, that does answer my question.  (whispers): This is working. Keep going.  (quietly): More? Oh, I can do more.  - Now let's potluck, baby! - (laughter)  Do it, Gene! Do it, baby!  (grunts, shouts)  Jiggle, jiggle   A-jiggle, a-jiggle   Jiggle, jiggle   A-jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle   Jiggle, jiggle   A-jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle   Jiggle, jiggle   A-jiggly, jiggly, jiggly, jiggly!   -  The Gene Show, Gene  - (mimics electric guitar)  The Gene Show is everybody's favorite show about Gene   Scrambly, scrambly, scrambly, scrambly, scrambly!  The Gene Show is everybody's favorite show about Gene   GENE: I'm Quiet Eli, baby!  The Gene Show is every"
"1  LINDA:  Goin' to my temp job on Christmas Eve   Extra money's nice when you're a little bit poor   Yeah  Buh-pum.  I still can't believe the post office lets randos  - like Mom come in and sort the mail. - GENE: Why not?  Have you seen her sort underpants?  The woman's a prodigy.  It's the busiest time of the year for the post office.  They need so much help they almost don't care  - where it comes from. - LOUISE: Clearly.  What are you doing  with that totally normal looking Santa doll?  I'm gonna hide him in the post office  and whoever finds him wins a candy cane.  Right. Um, why?  'Cause it's Christmas Eve, Bob.  Everyone wants a little Christmas cheer  from Linda's big sack.  Maybe don't say big sack.  - GENE: Big sack! - TINA: Big sack! - (groans) Mm.  Now that I have your attention.  Super friendly reminder that tonight  is the first annual Kid-Only Belcher Kid Gift Exchange.  Aw, so generous.  Not really. Price limit is one allowance.  That's low. Your allowance is almost nothing.  Yup. Yup. Definitely a challenge.  Aw, I can't wait.  - Anyway. Bye. - Uh, Lin?  When will you be home? Remember,  your parents and sister are coming over later.  Yeah, all three of 'em.  Hey, they're like the three wise men.  - Right. Except one brings hurtful comments. - (chimes)  (shouting indistinctly)  - One brings lots of phlegm. - (cough)  - And one is Gayle. - Hi.  Y-You need to be here when they show up. Please?  Don't worry, Bob. I'm coming home right after work.  Eesh, you think I don't know what happens when my parents  and Gayle get together and I'm not there to keep the peace?  It'll be the ottoman situation all over again.  - The ottoman situation? - Don't mention it, Bob.  Just don't even bring it up.  And also, you'll be here, right?  - To not bring it up? - TINA: We'll be here, Dad.  That's nice, but you guys  just give them a hug and then you run away.  Uh-uh. We sneak away.  To be fair, I'm a lot.  Less is more with me.  (jingle bells ringing)  Sort, sort, sort, sort, sort, sort, sorted.  Sort, sort, sort, sort  Scratch my butt, that feels good.  Ah! So much mail.  If you ask me, though,  this is the best place to be on Christmas Eve.  Except at home.  And if you accidentally got locked in the mall.  I bet that would be really fun.  - Shopping spree. - Uh, huh  - Yeah. (chuckles) - Just think.  There's little presents in every one of these boxes.  We get to play Santa. We spread cheer.  All over the world, people are sending stuff, getting stuff  Faces are lighting up.  Old ones. Young ones.  Famous ones.  Andie MacDowell, probably.  And it's all because of us; well, me, temporarily.  You're lucky, you get to do it full-time.  Huh? Uh, you say something?  Oh. Oh. Well, I'll just tell you again.  Just think. There's little presents in every one of these boxes.  Ah! My gah! What is this hideous thing?  Donna! Ha-hey.  You found Santa.  Now you get to keep the candy cane.  Everyone loves a candy cane, right?  But it's chocolate-flavored; it's kinda gross.  - I didn't read the box. - Uh-huh.  Seasonal hires. Lord help me.  Mike There he is.  Mike, you're the one who vouched for Linda  during the hiring process, correct?  - Uh yeah. - Aw, thanks, Mike.  What a nice guy, right?  Oh, he's backing away without saying anything.  Okay, bye, Mike.  LOUISE: Hey, T. Whatcha up to?  Ah, Louise!  Did you, um, see inside the tote?  Uh, I totes did not.  Did you see what was inside the tote?  No. Geez, Tina. Easy, girl.  Sorry. I It's just the first annual Kid-Only Belcher Kid Gift Exchange.  - We're all feeling the pressure. - Right.  Ugh. I saw the gift exchange gifts Tina got for us.  - That bad, huh? - No. Good.  Remember at the grocery store,  there was a vending machine with Burobu figures,  and I wanted the Slug-aconda  but it was too far from the vending hole?  Not really. But that's vending holes for you.  Tina remembered. Ugh. She must've been  plugging quarters into that thing all afternoon.  - What did she get me? - I'm not sure.  It was like a little tub of sprinkles?  Were they pink?  Actually, yeah.  She got me Pinkles?!  My favorite frozen yogurt topping,  and only available wholesale.  Ugh, Tina.  - Gah This is bad. This is very bad. - Wait. Why?  'Cause my gift for her  isn't half as good as her gift for me.  What's Santa gonna think?  Oh, he's so judge-y.  - What is your gift for Tina? - What's yours?  Wait. We'll say it as the same time.  One, two, three  BOTH: Barrette.  - Seriously? - Hoo boy.  Now a barrette looks like we didn't try at all.  I mean, I still had to go into her drawer and get one.  And this one's going to the plant. And this one's going to the plant.  And this one's going to the plant.  Linda! Do you have to say that for every package?  - Sorry, sorry, Donna. - All right, people,  as of this minute, the post office is closed.  The sooner we're gone, the sooner we're not here.  CUSTOMER: Uh, please?  - It's Christmas! - Wha?  Sir, we're closed.  Yeah, but it's a present for my nephew.  - He's He's seven. - Aw. His little nephew.  This needs to get to him on Christmas Day.  Special delivery. You you do that, right?  We do that if you get it in before five minutes ago.  Listen, maybe you have a nephew who you love very much?  - I have kids. - Kids?  That's not the same thing.  But you get it, kinda. This is important.  I'm late for a flight or I-I'd take it myself.  All right, all right, all right. I'll take it, just hurry up.  Oh! Thank you.  (gasps) I just spied on a Christmas miracle.  Like one of those goats looking at little baby Jesus.  Aw, eating a tin can, looking at Jesus.  Truck's here. Load 'em up!  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Ugh. How many times do I have to say it, people?  Stack your empties. Your mom doesn't work here.  Except for Ernie, because I'm his mom.  ERNIE: Gah! Mom!  LINDA: Where'd I hide Santa?  Oh, gotcha, you rascal.  Who stacked these? Geez.  (gasps) The gift for the little nephew.  Come on, Linda. I'm locking up.  Donna, look.  This never made it onto the truck.  (sighs) Really? Crap.  Well, whoever sent it can file a claim.  But there's a present in here for a little boy.  - How do you know that? - The guy said.  He came in just as we were closing.  But people in that situation have been known to lie.  It could be anything in there; it could be human poop.  What? People send poop in the mail?  - Oh, yeah. - Why?  Ah, different reasons.  - Mostly bad. - Oh.  Linda, if that package isn't at the plant by now,  there's nothing we can do.  Put it aside, we'll get to it on the 26th.  Now let's go.  But nephew Christmas.  DONNA: Linda! Come on!  I got to do something. Oh, Santa's in there.  Keep your mouth shut, Santa. I'm doing this for you.  I took a package, don't know what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna take it to the plant.  I don't have time to take it to the plant.  I got to get back to the house.  But how else is it gonna get to the nephew? Ah, I need a candy cane.  Ugh, chocolate. (spitting)  TINA: Grandma and Grandpa haven't been here in a while.  Big night, huh, Dad?  I'll bet they're gonna say I grew.  Mm-hmm. Yep. Yep.  Oh, God, Linda, get home.  Uh, wh-where's your brother and sister?  Probably wrapping gifts for the gift exchange.  If I know them, everything has to be just so.  Ugh. Not even Tina's journal can help us find a gift for Tina.  - (door closing) - GENE: Mom's home.  Or that stray cat that knows how to open doors is back.  The relatives will be here soon, and then we're stuck.  I just know Santa's looking at us right now, going  (grumbling) Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.  Tina, don't chop so fast.  We'll finish cooking too soon  and I won't have an excuse to stay in the kitchen  when your grandparents and Gayle are here.  Copy that.  - Chop - Slower.  Chop  Oh, thank God. You're home.  How long until they get here again?  Uh, like a half hour. Why?  Hm. Half hour. I think I can make it.  - Go-ho-ho-ho for it. - (jingle bells jingling)  I need to pop out.  Just for a second. It's a work thing.  What? Don't ""I have to pop out"" me, Linda.  You're the buffer between me and your parents.  And you help keep the peace between them and Gayle.  - Bob - And you know all the lies  that Gayle tells them to make it sound  like she's having a better life than she's having.  - I can't keep track. - Remember when she told them  she was doing some eyebrow modeling abroad?  Bob, calm down. I'll be back before you know it.  Just drink.  (sighs) Fine. Hurry, please.  Gene and I are gonna go with Mom.  - What? - We are?  Right, we are.  No, kids. I got to be quick.  But we've already spent so much  of Christmas Eve without our mommy.  We don't want to miss another solitary second.  Aw, she called me ""mommy.""  Al right, fine. We're going now, let's go.  (Bob whimpers)  I could go for some Christmas Eve mommy time.  - Hell, no, Tina, you stay here! - Cool, cool, cool.  LOUISE: What's in that mama-jama?  It's a very special gift for someone's very special nephew.  Whose? Uncle Kracker's?  - Nephew Kracker? - No. Maybe.  We're dropping it off at the sorting plant.  This is a mission.  To spread Christmas cheer.  It's fun, right? Christmas is fun.  Yeah! Take that, Charlie Brown, you mope.  Question: on the way back,  can we stop somewhere cheap?  Uh, and well stocked with, you know,  just, like, Tina-friendly items?  Is this about your gift exchange?  You half-assed it, huh?  Ugh. I thought we all had an agreement to half-ass it.  Well, everything's closed, but we'll see what we can do.  And we got to get back before Grandma says anything  like the horrible things she normally says.  (doorbell ringing)  Oh, no. Oh, no.  Maybe it's Mom and she's just being really formal?  So you guys are here early.  Yeah, we were gonna stop at my house first.  My big, rich person house.  - Your? - House that I bought  from being a world-famous Internet doctor?  Right. Right.  But workmen were there.  I'm having some bathrooms removed.  Because you have so many bathrooms?  Don't worry, Bob, I'll keep the one you always stink up.  (Bob and Gayle laughing)  - Oh, God. - (hacking)  You okay, Grandpa?  Need something to drink?  - (hacking cough) - Wow.  It's cold in here.  Did they turn off your heat again?  No. It's just winter.  Maybe you'd be more comfortable in the living room, by the tree?  - Where's Linda? - She'll be here any minute now.  - I hope. - GLORIA: Oh!  That's supposed to be the tree?  (Bob whining)  Hello! Can somebody let us in?  I work for the Postal Service. Temporarily.  Another Christmas Eve screaming through a fence.  - (phone buzzing) - Oh, it's your father.  Hi, sweetie. How are things?  Linda, where are you?  Your family's here.  - Already? - Yeah.  I'm almost sorta done.  Uh, I'll be back soon.  How soon is soon, Linda?  Soon, Bob. Where are they? What are they doing?  Well, right now they're in the living room.  Tina's telling them the story  of how she almost took piano lessons.  Ooh, that's a good story, but Bob,  - you got to be in there, too. - What?  They need supervision.  They need a buffer.  I can't buff. I'm cooking.  Then bring 'em in there with you.  - (whimpering) - I'm sorry.  - I love you very much. - No, you don't!  I do and I'm gonna be home soon and it'll be  - the best Christmas ever. - (motor rumbling)  - I promise. - Mom, look.  Oh! Oh, uh, truck's coming.  - Bob, I got to go. - Linda, wait.  Oh, and if they bring up the ottoman thing,  change the subject.  What's the ottoman thing again?  - I got to go. Bye. - No!  (gasps) It's like the North Pole.  I think I smell reindeer.  - No, that's Gene. - Thank you.  So we just drop the package and go?  No. We got to make sure it goes out tonight.  We got to talk to the person in charge.  You mean the plant manager?  We got to get this package on the truck,  or it'll ruin some nephew's Christmas and he'll probably cry  and none of the angels will get their wings.  - Come on, Mom, try to sell it. - Uh, how do I put this nicely?  Who the hell are you?  Sorry. Uh, Linda Belcher.  Postal clerk. Just for the holidays.  My-my boss is Donna something.  Uh-huh. And these are your kids?  Eh, technically, biologically.  Can you help us out?  The package, it's for Christmas delivery?  - Yeah. - So it's Priority Express.  That truck left five minutes ago.  - That was the truck? - Mm-hmm.  Also, you're a sorting clerk?  - Sorta. - And you removed that package  from your P.O. without authorization?  I could call your superior.  Oh, God, don't tell Donna!  It would ruin our great relationship.  But it's Christmas Eve.  Drop the package in the bin outside my office.  We'll forget this happened.  So it'll get there tomorrow?  God, no. December 26, if you're lucky.  But that's when they celebrate Christmas somewhere, right?  Australia, Russia I don't know.  (sighs): All right. Thanks.  Uh-huh. Bin's outside my office.  Wasn't that the bin?  Or is my bin-dar way off?  This isn't that far away.  And on Christmas Eve, we'd get there in no time.  We'd even have time to stop at the store real quick?  - Yeah, sure, sure. - What about Dad?  He seems what's a less sad way of saying ""scared of Grandma""?  (chuckles): He'll be fine.  He makes a big deal out of seeing my parents,  - but he loves them, deep down. - Real deep.  - (chuckles): So far deep. - Puts his butt to sleep.  Yeah. Good. So, it's a quick little long drive  - to another town pop-out. - Yes!  All right, we got to do this quick.  Not that they'll come looking for us.  The guy at the plant had enough going on.  He won't notice one little bitty missing package, right?  (sighs): Oh. Seriously?  - (line rings) - Hello?  Donna, it's Fred over at the distro center.  I think one of your seasonal hires went loco  and made off with a Priority Express parcel.  Oh. Let me guess.  Linda Belcher? I'll take care of it.  Hello? It's Donna.  Hey, Donna. What's up?  Linda Belcher went rogue.  She took a Priority Express package  and is delivering it herself.  - Dear Lord. Not Priority Express. - Uh-huh. You vouched for her.  - I need you to handle it. - With care.  Did that sound cool?  Uh, sure.  (groans) Christmas is the worst.  Hallelujah   Hallelujah, hallelujah   Hallelujah.   GLORIA: Bob?  I think I threw away my medication.  - Will you root through the garbage for me? - Uh, yeah.  You know, I don't have to get my own Christmas tree.  (breathily): My lover gets it for me.  Dirk. Dirk Moneyrich.  Right, Bob? You met him.  Uh, ri oh, right.  Remember, you guys arm-wrestled?  He said you flirted with him.  - Mm-hmm, yep, yep. - Everyone good for drinks?  Uh, Grandpa, more milk?  (clearing phlegm): Yes, please.  Oh, my God.  Aw, this is fun, Bob.  Especially compared to last year  and all that business with  (sighs heavily): the ottoman.  Uh, wait, what? Uh, hey, uh, maybe we should  Ugh! Again with the ottoman?  - Oh, no. Okay, uh - (gasps) Ottoman?  Um, uh  Deck the halls with balls of holly   - Take it, Tina! - Uh,  La-la-la-la-la   Da-da-deck the halls.   (phone rings)  Uh-oh. Hello?  Linda, it's Mike.  Oh, h-hi, Mike.  Uh, how's your chestnuts?  They roasting? (nervous chuckle)  Do you still have that Priority Express package?  I, uh  Hey, look, it's okay.  We have mail carrier-mail sorter confidentiality.  Okay. I've got it. I'm-I'm dropping it off  for a little boy in Bog Harbor on Murray Hill Drive.  Linda, there's no such thing  as mail carrier-mail sorter confidentiality.  - Damn it! - Reroute and bring the package to me.  And then you'll deliver it?  No. I'll bring it to the plant. That's the law.  I-I can't do that, Mike.  Look, I was like you once.  I loved being a mailman on Christmas.  I felt like a large elf.  Or a small Santa.  I took the mail personally.  But now I just take the mail.  Aw, Mike, why?  You got to follow protocol.  No matter what the package is or who it's for  or what they tell you is inside.  - You talking about poop? - I'm talking about poop.  The guy who dropped this off wasn't like that. He was nice.  Well-well, kind of weird, a little sweaty, but nice.  Nice, sweaty and weird: if my penis could talk.  Listen, Mike, I-I'm sorry, but I got to pretend  my cell phone's not working now.  - (imitates static) - L-Linda, don't do it.  - I'm losing you, Mike. - Do not do this, Linda.  Sorry, honey. Even on Christmas Eve,  I can't fail the mail.  Did that sound badass, or?  Uh, kinda.  And a partridge in a pantry.   Yay! Tina, that was great singing.  - What else can we sing? - No more singing!  I want to talk about the ottoman incident.  - Uh-oh. - Crap.  Ottoman, ottoman, ottoman!  Let it go already!  Or, uh, let it snow.  Uh, o-one more time, people.  - Uh - Bob, you be the judge.  Listen to my side of the story,  then my parents' side,  and then tell me I'm right.  Ha! We're right!  Me? Judge? Uh, I just realized  I have to go to the bathroom  so much  for so long. Bye-bye.  Uh  anyone think I've grown at all?  - No. - Good eye, good eye.  I can't believe even the big chain stores  were closed for the holidays.  Since when did they have a soul?  Oh, it's hopeless. Mom, just give me the package.  Whatever's in it, I'll give it to Tina.  No. Louise, no. Oh, we're here, we're here!  Okay, here goes Christmas.  - MIKE: Linda Belcher. - Aah!  - Mike! - Yeah.  You're here? How'd you make it so fast?  Don't mess with a mail carrier.  We know all the surface streets.  Hand over the package, Linda.  Uh  but, uh  Quick, put a stamp on me and tell him I'm the package.  I want to do this for you.  - Linda, give the package to me. - Just let me deliver it!  Let me spread this Christmas cheer, damn it!  You're not a mail carrier.  But we try to love her anyway.  That package is going back to the plant. It's the law.  - Sounded cool when you said that. - Finally.  Uh, I I got to do this.  Even if there is no little boy in there.  - Uh, Mom? - And even if there's nothing  in this package but a whole bunch of human poop.  Mom, look.  LINDA (gasps): There is a little boy.  - He's real. - And he's spectacular.  What is this? Are you guys carolers or something?  We're not. We're kids.  Much like you, m'boy.  Uh, we're-we're from the post office.  Really? Is that package for me?  I'm not a mail carrier, but you are.  Come on, Mike, deliver the package.  - I don't know. - Take it.  Mike, no.  - Damn. - Cold-hearted.  Aw. I'm so sorry, sweetie.  Signature required.  Aw, Mike, you're doing it. Like Santa.  What's happening?  Special delivery. I need someone to sign.  Are you undercover mail people?  We sure are, ma'am.  - Have a candy cane. - Oh.  A brown one?  Chocolate. It's chocolate.  - Oh. - It's not great.  Okay. Um, thank you. Merry Christmas.  Uh, hey, what's, uh, what's the gift sitch in there?  Got any extras?  - Any extra presents? - Extra gifts.  You know, you got so many, you're like, ""Ugh,  - I got doubles of this"" - I mean, I  I don't have doubles. No, I  Kids, come on, let's go.  - You know? - We open them tomorrow,  - so I don't really know. - Oh, yeah?  You want to just give me one?  If it's great, I'll send it back.  If not, maybe I did you a favor.  Louise, now!  TINA: Dad?  - Hmm? - Are you doing that thing  where you say you have to go to the bathroom  but really you're just sort of avoiding things?  No. I'm, uh, really going.  I would know if you were. We all would know.  - Well - They need you in there, Dad.  Mom helps them to not talk about things.  Maybe you could go the other way?  You mean help them work it out?  Oof. Sounds hard. But yeah.  (sighs) All right, if I come out,  you're not just gonna run in here and lock the door, are you?  - No. - Promise?  Yes.  - (grunts) - You promised!  Sorry, sorry. Got to stay strong.  Okay, tell me about the ottoman.  Finally!  It was last Christmas.  I was in Florida,  visiting them in their condo.  Dirk Moneyrich was at our other house in Tuscany.  They were so happy to see me because I'm their favorite.  And I had a really fun idea  for that night, when our cousin Donnie was coming over.  I was gonna hide in the flip-up ottoman  Dad uses to store his slippers,  and when Donnie came over, I was gonna jump out  (chuckles): and surprise him.  So I got in.  But I dozed off in there.  New meds.  When I tried to jump out,  I was trapped under Donnie's stupid heavy gifts  that weren't even for me.  Then they left to go to a movie without me!  I was in that ottoman for hours, trapped,  with those smelly slippers.  It was hell!  We didn't know where you went.  We didn't think you were serious about the ottoman.  Of course I was serious! It was an incredible idea!  Also, I was yelling for you to let me out!  - We're hard of hearing. - Huh?  Al, we're talking about the ottoman!  - I keep my slippers in there. - GAYLE: I know!  Their scent will haunt me!  I still wake up screaming, ""Slippers!""  Okay, okay, everyone calm down.  I-I I think we can settle this.  (laughter)  It's unbelievable. They're all laughing.  - What did you do? - I-I just told them  that it's more important to be together on Christmas  than it is to win some dumb argument.  - And that worked? - Kinda. Not really.  But then I went into the bedroom and called Gayle  pretending to be from the bank.  I told her to put it on speakerphone.  I said she had too much money and it was overflowing  and was a fire hazard.  And your parents seemed to believe it.  That put everyone in a good mood.  - Aw, good for Gayle. - Yep.  - Wow, it's a - Origami swan.  Made from a Priority Express packing slip.  - Yeah. We learned origami. - And don't even ask  Mike the Mailman if he's really good at it,  'cause what does that have to do with anything?  But that's not all Gene and I got you something else.  - You ready? - Yep.  Here it is.  (all sigh)  Sorry, T, we wanted to get you something better.  Oh, guys, this is the best gift you could give me.  Unless you're setting me up for my real gift?  - We're not. - Uh-huh. M'kay.  Tina, you're patting me down?  - Seriously, there's no other gift. - Shh. I know.  GENE: Now her hand's in my pocket.  TINA: Oh, there's a barrette in here. Aw.  Bah, humbug, now, that's too strong   'Cause it's my favorite holiday   But all this Year blur-blurred   Duh-da-da-da-da energy   To add already rushed   Just 'cause it is the, 'tis the season   The perfect gift for me would be   Christmas by myself   ALL:  Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas   Couldn't miss this one this year   Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas   Couldn't miss this one this year   Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas   Couldn't miss this one this year   Merry Christmas."
"1  GENE: Can you believe that whole cafeteria fiasco?  Are you talking about the lunch lady shorting you  - a couple of tater tots? - Aka Tater-gate? Yes.  I told you, Gene. You should have shoved the tots you did get  in the lunch lady's tailpipe.  And burn that bridge? No.  Plus, any tot's better than not.  Suit yourself. Get walked all over.  Speaking of walking all over,  I'm gonna swing by Ocean Avenue Hi-Fi Emporium for a little bit.  That's, like, the third time this week.  Geez, for a guy who doesn't steal stuff,  you spend a lot of time at a pawnshop.  It's more than a pawnshop It's a gathering place  for gently used musical instruments and equipment.  And if you very convincingly suggest that you're thinking  about buying something, they let you play with it!  Gene, I think the guy's starting to suspect  you don't really have any money.  Why? Just 'cause he says, ""You again?""  every time Gene walks in?  That's just his greeting for everyone, I think.  Anyway, there's this drum machine.  I'm not saying we're in love, but I can't stop thinking  about it, and I think it feels the same way about me.  - Lucky. - I want to try out  this idea I have for a sound/beat/electronic music  installation.  It's a space cowbell that goes:  Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh- bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh   Boo, space.   - You guys want to join me? - I could go for space cowbell.  No. I want to go help Mom and Dad at the restaurant.  (laughs): Of course I'm coming!  Hey, Teddy! Late lunch for you today, huh?  Me? No, I couldn't. I-I already ate.  Just popped in to say hi.  So, hi.  - Hi. - But boy,  I would love a burger. But I-I already ate.  - Yeah, you mentioned that. - Anyway, I have this job this week  that might keep me away from lunch here for a couple of days.  - Nothing weird. - Why are you yelling?  - Was I?! - You still are.  Sorry. But I'll be back a lot. Right?  So after the job's over, it'll be like old times.  Just like old times, right?  - We'll see you then, huh? - Mm-hmm.  Don't change. Stay the same.  - (chuckles) - BOB: Uh-huh. Yeah.  - Okay, all right. - LINDA: Well  - TEDDY: Uh, okay. - You - So long.  - You know where to find us. - I'm gonna go.  - Yeah, we'll be here. - Yup. Yup.  -Goodbye, Teddy. -Bye. -Door's door's that way.  - Okay, yup. I'm all right. - Yeah, you're walking into a window.  (laughs) Where what am I trying to do here, Bobby?  He's acting weird, huh?  Yeah. Maybe he drank paint by accident again.  Yeah.  - Hey, Dino. - You again?  Yup. I just came in to show my sisters that sweet beat machine  that I'm totally thinking about buying  with all of my money that I have  - that I was just recently counting. - Right.  Hello, my pretty.  (electronic dance beat plays)  Eh ?  That's exactly what I thought it would be.  Powerful, right? Feel free to just  let your body go.  Yeah, let my body go all the way over here.  You guys think I could pull off a tambourine?  I could go by ""Tambourine Tina.""  - ""Tambourina""? - Maybe ""Tina-bourine.""  Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh- bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh   -  Bluh-bluh-bluh - (Dino groaning loudly)  Look at you with your fingers in your ears!  That's a fun dance.  Huh.  - What's going on? - What?  One of the tall plants in front of Pesto's  - is moving by itself. - Huh?  Is that Teddy?  - Of course it is. - Hi, guys.  I-I just cut through the alley across the street  to get in here from that job I might have mentioned  that's not even on this street.  Oh. That's, um, that's great.  Okay! Fine! My job this week is at Jimmy Pesto's!  There, I said it! Happy? Is that what you want to hear?!  Teddy, calm down.  You would have done the same thing, Bob!  I-I didn't say anything, Teddy.  Oh, okay! The silent treatment, huh?  Real mature, Bob! Real mature!  What am I supposed to do, not take the job?  - I got to work, Bob! - Teddy  What are you gonna do, tell me which jobs I can take?  - No. I - Congratulations. You got  everything you wanted!  I'll just shoot you an e-mail about my upcoming jobs,  and then you can just cross out the ones  that you don't want me to take!  What the hell was that?  Yeah. That was weird, even for Teddy.  (gasps) I bet I know what's going on.  -What? -He probably had a sexy dream about me,  and now he doesn't know how to act.  It doesn't seem like it's that at all.  - What else could it be? - Well, probably the exact thing  - he said it was. - No.  A woman knows.  (electronic dance beat plays)  Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh- bluh-bluh-bluh   Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh- bluh-bluh-bluh   Uh, Dino?  I think you accidentally turned the drum machine off.  No, I definitely meant to do that.  - What?! - Every time you come in,  it's the same thing you get your sticky little fingers  all over the drum machine!  Little? Thank you.  And it's pretty obvious by now  that you're not gonna buy this thing,  so you're just wearing out the merchandise.  I'm making it better!  I'm saving all my patterns, so whoever buys this  is gonna get a gold record for free!  Um, I was gonna clear those patterns,  so people wouldn't think the thing is haunted.  (gasps) How dare you!  Gene's unappreciated in his time,  - but give it another week. - Yeah, trying being a Di-yes  instead of a Di-no.  Come back when you have money and clean hands, huh?  Until then, don't touch the instrument!  Now, scooch!  Wow, Dino, those are some harsh words. I think  it's best if one of us leaves right now.  - I work here! - It wouldn't be work  if you loved what you did.  I was just about to buy two or three tambourines,  but I guess we're leaving. Oh, well.  You probably get this all the time,  but you should be a little nicer, Dino.  You probably get this all the time goodbye.  You gave my brother sad face,  and that kind of gives me mad face.  You're giving me ""I don't care"" face.  Hey, quick question: you ever see John Wick?  Yeah. Why?  Well, I'm John Wick,  and Gene is my puppy,  and you're those guys who did something to the puppy.  I'm not sure what, because I only saw the trailer.  But I know enough about it to know that you're gonna pay.  Pay!  You seem a little quiet today, Gene.  Well, these are soft tacos. They can only get so loud.  Are you sure you're okay from yesterday?  The whole drum machine thing?  'Cause if you want to talk, I've got two ears,  and they're tuned to the listening station.  I'm fine. You know what I realized yesterday?  I don't even really like that drum machine.  I mean, all those zappy sounds, right?  And the way the rubbery buttons felt  under my soft, soft fingers?  Oh, who am I kidding? I love that drum machine!  There it is. Let it out.  That guy Dino's a dingleberry wrapped in a dirty diaper.  And people like him need to get what's coming to them.  Whoa, no need for dingle-bashing.  So what are we gonna do to get Dino back?  No, no, no, no. Don't do anything.  Maybe I'll go by Ocean Avenue Hi-Fi and talk to him.  See if I can win him over with my effortless charm.  Yeah. Do that. Makes sense.  I'm gonna start walking to class now.  I'm moving a little slower than usual today.  (Gene groaning quietly)  (groaning growing louder)  Hey. You guys want to help me get revenge  - on a guy who's mean to Gene? - Who was mean to Gene?  What did they do to my precious little lamb?  I guess I'll do it if it doesn't take that long  and I don't have to do much.  That's my kindhearted boy!  I could move some things around.  I'm moving my thing around right now.  Great. So, I was thinking  Louise, are you sure this is a good idea?  It sounded like Gene didn't want to do anything to Dino.  (chuckles): Tina, Tina, Tina, trust me.  We have to teach Dino a lesson.  Gene is gonna thank us for it. So here's what we're gonna do.  (low groaning)  Hold on, just gonna put my hand over Tina's mouth.  - (muffled groaning) - Okay, so  TEDDY: Good burger today, Bob.  - Wh-What'd you use, beef? - Uh, yeah.  - Just, uh, just trying it out. - (chuckles): Well  it's a good idea.  Stick with it, because, uh  it's, uh this is great.  - Eh. - Yeah. Stick with what works.  (chuckles) We-we got a little crazy yesterday, huh?  Didn't we? Eh.  I'm just happy things are getting back to normal.  We both said some things that we regret,  but it's all in the past.  So you really like the burger, huh?  - Like it? It's fantastic. - Well, you've taken two bites.  You want me to heat it up or something?  - What are you trying to say? - I'm asking if anything's wrong.  You saying that I get free fettuccine  on the job at Pesto's?  That I come here full of fettuccine?!  - That doesn't make sense! - (sighs)  Oh, yeah, I was wondering what was on your neck.  - It's a noodle. - That's not from me!  I-It's a hazard of the job!  There's noodles everywhere over there!  I don't care either way, Teddy.  If you don't care, then why are you yelling?!  Because this whole thing is stupid!  Teddy, are you sure this isn't because you had  - a sexy dream about me? - What? No!  Recently? No!  - I'm still not sure about this. - Watch and learn, T.  You'll see how a little thing called ""justice"" works.  Okay, I'll send you in one at a time.  You ask to play an instrument.  Start playing loud and proud and don't stop.  Does it matter what we play?  Nope. As long as it's annoying.  Because I can play ""Lady in Red"" on a keyboard.  Damn it, Jimmy Jr., this is not a ""Lady in Red"" situation.  Why is nothing ever a ""Lady in Red"" situation?!  Someday, buddy. You'll do it.  God, I hope I'm there.  There's no need to get worked up over all this, Bob.  Oh, my God, Teddy, I-I can't stress enough  how much I really don't care.  I don't want you to feel like you have to eat here,  especially if you already ate some crappy, overcooked pasta.  - Hello! - Oh, hey, Mort.  - What'll it be, Mort? - What's good here?  - Burgers? Ha-ha-ha! - (Bob chuckles)  Oh, I see. I get it. I see!  You and your inside jokes with Mort!  Is that how it is now?  What are you talking about?  Oh, it's just a coincidence  The same week I do a job at Pesto's,  all of the sudden Mort comes in here and says something funny?  Mort said something funny before. I think.  He's using you, Mort! Can't you see that?  - He doesn't even care about you! - Huh?  - Teddy, please. - He's trying to make me jealous,  but it's not working.  Come on, Mort, let's get out of here.  - Uh - We're leaving! Get your things!  I was gonna have a burger?  Fine! Suit yourself!  Uh, so, burger of the day?  Please. With a side of bÃ©ar-mace.  (chuckles): See? I-I say funny things.  - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, yeah.  Okay, it's go time.  Zeke, we're starting with you.  - Go, go, go, go, go! - I'm on it!  Hi there. I want to buy  that funny-looking guitar, but, uh, I want to see  if it can handle what I'm putting out first.  Fine. But watch out, the guy who sold this to me  was a glam guy I keep wiping it down,  but there's always more glitter on it.  I hate glitter!  I get it You're glitter bitter.  All right! Listen to her purr!  (electric guitar blasting)  Bongo, bongo, bongo, bongo, bongo, bongo   -  Bongo, bongo, bongo  - Hey. Remember us?  I was the one who was about to heavily invest in tambourines.  It was probably a little easier when you only had my brother  in here drum-machining his heart out, huh?  You still feel good about making him feel bad?  - What?! - I said, you still feel good  about making him feel bad?!  I can't hear you!  Right. It's hard to yell my big speech with all the noise!  It's fine! I'll yell louder!  You just got John Wick'd! Boom!  Okay, Dino, I know you wanted me to stay away  until I had some money and clean hands,  and I may not have the money now, but my hands are  Damn it! Okay, how about this?  You get ten percent of all my future earnings  from playing that drum machine. What do you say?  (high-pitched): You got it, Gene!  (normal voice): This could actually work.  - (cacophonous music blasting) - What's going on?  What are you guys doing here?  New store policy!  No one under 12 can demo any of the instruments!  - No! - ZEKE: That's cool.  I'm 13. (laughs)  New store policy!  No one under 14 can demo any of the instruments!  Aw, dag.  Forever!  No !  Surprise.  LINDA: Gene, why are you looking away from everyone  while you're eating? Is there a butterfly in here  - and it's making you mad? - No, Mother,  I'm mad at a certain sister  who's made it impossible for me to be together  with my beloved drum machine at Ocean Avenue Hi-Fi Emporium  - for three years! - Louise.  Whoa, why do you assume it was Louise?  - It was you? - No, it was Louise.  I was trying to help, Gene.  The man was going to erase all of your patterns,  which I still don't understand but it sounds pretty bad.  Plus, he wasn't gonna let you play it anymore anyway.  I could have worn him down! (chewing angrily)  He still hasn't got what's coming to him.  We're going to level two now.  First, we served him appetizer justice.  Now we're serving him main course justice  with a side salad of ""Oh, no""  and a bottomless basket of ""Yeah! We went there.""  Don't do any of that.  It just makes everything worse!  Okay, that's enough.  No more fighting with each other or anyone else.  - Uh, yeah. - And you, Bob.  - Wait, what did I do? - You have to make up with Teddy.  What's going on with Teddy?  - Nothing. Never mind. - They're arguing.  Maybe about a sexy dream Teddy had, maybe not.  - No. - Just end it, Bob.  Put your hands on his hand, look into his eyes  and whisper, ""I'm sorry.  And I'll always love you.""  (sighs) Fine.  I-I mean, I'm not doing that,  but I'll do something like it.  Look at me, I'm a peace broker.  Tina, who are you fighting with?  What? No one.  - Tina - No one!  Hey, don't get smart with me, Miss Missy.  Hold on, hold on.  Now you and me are fightin'.  Let's squash this thing, okay?  Phew. Okay.  Aw, look at Teddy,  - working out front so we see him. - Mm.  Poor guy.  - Hello. - Hey, Mort.  - (tires screech, horn honks) - Burger of the day, please.  - Hello, everyone. - Hi, Teddy.  - (quietly): Bob, go. -  H-Hi, Teddy.  Um, I just wanted to say I  - I am sorry. - Yeah, great.  I'm just gonna stand over here  while you're talking.  (quietly): Bob, go for his hand.  - Touch his hand. - (grumbles)  - Hey! - What the? Look!  Mort's sneaking fettuccine in here!  Look at what's on his lap!  A bunch of fettuccine! Damn you, Mort!  - Have you learned nothing? - Teddy  What? Bob, just kick Mort out, right?  - What? - Fair is fair!  Did you bring that fettuccine in a cup, Teddy?  What? No! What cup?  It was Mort. Mort had it.  Mort, grab your fettuccine!  Put it back in your pockets!  - Leave! - I really  - Teddy, stop. - Do the first honorable thing  - in your whole life! - Teddy, you need to stop.  Mort's breaking the fettuccine rules!  But I guess rules don't apply to Mr. Perfect Mort,  so I'm leaving!  Okay. Bye!  What'd you say, Bob?  I said ""bye.""  Fine! Bye!  - Could I get a rag or something? - (tires screech)  Oh, right. Yeah.  (birds chirping)  So, I've been brainstorming all morning  - on how to fix this. - Fix what, your cowlick?  Just wet it down. Mlah.  Not that, but thank you.  I'm talking about how I can prove to Dino  that I should be allowed to play that drum machine.  Or you could just destroy him.  I'm not talking to you.  I know Mom said to stop fighting, but I'm still mad.  Come on, Gene. It's what he deserves.  Tina, tell Louise this isn't her fight to fight.  It's mine. And it's not even a fight I would have picked.  But now that she started it, I have to finish it!  Tell Louise  - Can you repeat that? - Never mind.  I'm gonna figure this out,  and you're not gonna do anything else.  - Right? - Fine. Sure.  Totally. Copy that.  Good. Now I got to go to math class.  And we better not be doing fractions,  because those are the devil's numbers!  Okay, Gene. You got it, buddy.  Not gonna get Dino back in any way!  - And that's that. - Yeah. Hey, hey, guys, guys.  We need to come up with a plan to get that guy Dino back.  - Damn it. - Didn't we do that yesterday?  - Or different Dino? - Same Dino, new plan.  What do we know about this guy? What does he hate?  Besides kids and modern hairstyles and pants that fit.  He said he hates glitter.  It was falling off the guitar I was playing,  and he was all like, ""Ew!""  What's his problem? Glitter's beautiful.  Hates glitter. That's good.  - Louise - (shushing)  Listen, I-I saw a thing online called a glitter box.  You put glitter in a balloon, blow it up,  put it in a box with a tack in the side, give it to someone.  They think they're getting a present.  They open the box, boom!  (laughs) Balloon pops,  glitter goes everywhere.  I got to call my glitter guy.  It's so quiet when Teddy's not in here yelling.  I know. Hey, you saw I tried to apologize, right?  Well, you know he just wants you to care  that he's doing a job at Jimmy Pesto's.  - But I don't care. - I think he needs you to.  But I need him to not need me to.  And also to be a normal person.  Can't you just go over there and act like you're mad  that he took the job?  - What? No. - Yeah. Come on. Do it for Teddy.  Or do you want him to keep throwing fettuccine at Mort  - for the rest of our lives? - I mean, maybe.  Okay, so we didn't tell Gene about this.  Not feeling great about that.  The toothpaste is out of the tube, T.  Okay, Jimmy Jr., you're on.  - (phone rings) - Ocean Ave. Hi-Fi.  (high-pitched): Um, yes. I saw an amp  toward the back of your store,  and I was wondering if it's still there.  Can you describe the amp?  Um, it's black,  and it was all the way in the back of the store.  Uh, let me take a look.  Could you be more specific?  'Cause we've got a lot of amps.  Never mind. I just remembered, um,  amps are dumb.  - Smooth. - Damn, J-Ju. Good voice.  Where you been hiding her?  Now we sit and wait.  I like sitting.  Oh, my God! I like waiting!  And that's the secret to our marriage.  We're in revenge mode.  - No hugging, please. - Oh.  All right, as soon as he opens that box,  he'll disappear into the biggest glitter cloud  the world's ever seen.  No, no. No, no.  Wait, what's Gene doing here?  Looks like he's going in the store.  Oh, no! He's gonna get glittered!  ZEKE: Uh-oh. Collateral damage!  Ge  ene!  Gene, Gene, listen to me (pants)  What are you doing here, Louise?  What are either of you doing here?  I think we all know that only one of us is over 14.  So, skid-doosh.  I told you not to do anything!  I'm not doing anything.  I just came to get you to  come play a game.  It's called Cross the Street.  Um, we cross the street as many times as we can  without getting hit by a car. It's fun.  Not now! I have unfinished business.  Dino, I am here to prove to you  that I deserve to play that drum machine.  How you gonna do that? With money?  No. You and me are gonna have a drum machine battle.  - (gasps) - Do what?  I play, then you play.  If I win, I get to come here after school anytime I want.  If you win, I walk out that door  and you never see me again.  Not even at a farmers market.  You're gonna lose.  I've been making beats forever.  I'm also in a cover band.  We're called Bell Biv Devo.  We play Bell Biv DeVoe and Devo covers.  That is information I was not aware of,  but I am still ready to battle.  You go first.  Okay, my sweet.  Let's get nasty.  (electronic dance beat plays)  Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba, boo-boo-boo-boop   He's actually not bad.  I could see myself dancing to this.  Oh, yeah. It's happening.  I'm doing it.  (laughs): Yeah.  Damn. You go, Gene!  You're giving J-Ju the wiggles.  Yes, he is.  Gene might actually pull this off.  Teddy's starting to pack up his truck, Bob.  Go over there and give him a little argument.  (sighs) Oh, okay.  All right, all right, I'm going.  That's a good Bob.  - BOB: Teddy. - Bob.  (stilted): I'm mad that you took this job at Jimmy Pesto's.  I knew it! That's why I was trying  to hide it from you, Bob. (chuckles nervously)  I'm jealous that you're spending all this time with Jimmy  instead of with me.  Yeah. Part of me said, uh, ""It'll be fine.  Bob's not that petty.""  But look at us. Here we are.  - (sighs) Yeah. Yeah. - Uh  Yeah, here we are.  What are we gonna do with us, huh, Bobby?  (laughs) What's going on here, Bob?  You crying because I stole your handyman/only customer?  - He was. - Yes!  Damn you, Jimmy Pesto!  Aw! He admitted it!  (chuckles) Ha!  He only goes to your restaurant because you pay him, Jimmy.  He comes to my restaurant because he likes it.  Plus, you'll never have what he and I have,  which is a real friendship in your life.  ""Yuh, duh, duh, duh, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Friendship in your life."" That's you. Zoom!  I want what they have.  - What? - Nothing.  Okay, this is getting a little awkward for me now.  Uh, I'm just gonna take off,  and I'll see you both tomorrow.  Eh  - That was nice of you, Bob. - I know.  The last thing you said sounded real.  - About friendship. - No, no.  That was It was all for show, Lin.  - (singsongy): You love Teddy. - Linda, please.  - You love him. - Oh, my God.  You're gonna have all of his babies.  (playing intricate beat)  (panting) He's really good.  I guess. If you like rhythm and cool sounds and stuff.  Sorry, Gene. Good effort though.  It was just like a kid going up against an adult.  M'kay. Well, you win, Dino,  fair and square.  By a mile!  I wish Dino was our dad.  You put up a hell of a fight, Gene.  Yeah, I did.  - My way, by myself. - What do you mean?  Louise, when you fight my battles,  it makes me feel like you don't think I can take care of myself.  I guess I never thought of it that way.  Someone hurts you and my brain goes into destroy mode  and I just want to (growls)  But, uh, yeah, I could, uh  I could chill out a little bit, maybe.  - I'm sorry. - Mom would be so proud of both you guys.  - And me. - Goodbye, Dino.  And goodbye to you, sweet lady drum machine.  I'll see you when I turn 14  or save up $215,  which would be in my mid-20s,  so I guess when I turn 14 then.  Wait. Gene, listen.  You sounded pretty good on that thing.  You-you remind me of a young, annoying me.  - Thank you? - So, how 'bout this.  You can come in the first Monday of each month  and play the drum machine until someone buys it.  We'll call it ""Wash Your Hands Mondays.""  Yay! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!  Well, I guess we'll all be leaving now.  Just gonna grab our stuff and go.  Congratulations, Gene.  You got something, which is better than nothing.  Yes! I love something!  So, what's in the box?  Is it an apology present? Gimme, gimme.  - Gene, no. - (grunts)  (Louise shouting)    Bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo- bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo   Space   Bl-Bl-Bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo- bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo   Don't you want to hear my space cowbell?   Don't you want to hear it right now?   Ooh   Bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo- bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo-bloo     Space   Don't you want to hear my space cowbell?   Don't you want to hear it   -  Right now?  -  Space."
